      "You walk on thickly padded carpet in this finely decorated, spacious room.  A jade marble lion guards near the door, and similar lion statues pose as endtables amongst the other furniture.  A couple of thrak hide couches and equally opulent armchairs are arranged in functional stances.  A trio of desks and a hefty conference table are the only indications that this place is more office than lounge.  Spanning the south wall is a window comprised of diamond-shaped sections of leaded glass."
