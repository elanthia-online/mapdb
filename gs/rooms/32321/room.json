    "description": [
      "Dark silk walls ripple in the keening mountain breeze, but cold finds no purchase within the richly appointed pavilion.  At its center has been erected a wide stone fire pit that fills the interior with the sharpness of resin and woodsmoke, though the latter is channeled up through a cut in the high ceiling.  Carpets embroidered with a briar sprig against a charcoal grey moon soften the ground.  There is a plenitude of finely upholstered seats around a great table of interlocking rosewood and ebony set near the fire's warmth."
