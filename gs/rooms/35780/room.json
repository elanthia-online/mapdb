    "description": [
      "Reaching out from the shoreline, a long pier stretches over the gentle waves, its wooden posts, darkened by years of salt and spray, rise from the water, bound together with thick ropes and iron bands.  Moored to the weathered pier, a two-masted brigantine looms tall against the horizon.  A grumpy dwarven sailor stands close by, his watchful gaze intent and alert.  Near the water's edge and nestled among some dwarf fruit trees, a solitary weathered bench offers an expansive view of the bay."
