    "description": [
      "Split-rail cedar fencing surrounds this forty-foot diameter enclosure.  The fencing is slightly sun-bleached, but otherwise in excellent condition.  Underfoot, the ground is littered with rolton dung and heavily indented with rolton tracks, as if a large number of roltons had been penned in here at one time.  No weeds grow anywhere inside the pen nor do any grow just outside the fencing.  All have been most likely eaten or trampled.  The pen's gate stands open, its closing blocked by a large rock."
