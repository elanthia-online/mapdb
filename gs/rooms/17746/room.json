      "Broken containers litter the floor of the storage room, the debris consisting of wooden planks as well as pieces of stone.  Large piles have been heaped against the walls, forming a rugged landscape that slopes down to a valley where the path winds between them.  Little light intrudes here, adding to the illusion of a mountainous terrain."
