      "Pristine marble floors stretch from the inner sanctuary's smooth walls, disappearing beyond a series of pillars beneath a landscape comprised of thousands of smooth grey, white, and moss agate stones.  High above, copper lanterns are anchored to the terracotta roofing tiles, shedding golden light upon a nearby painted mural.  Sea breezes drift through the area, its cool, ethereal fingers causing a subtle, brief chill in the air."
