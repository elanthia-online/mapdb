      "Much like a turbulent sky foretelling an impending storm, swirls of dark grey paint cover the lofty ceiling of this shop, and a multitude of wares are strewn about haphazardly as if they had been ravaged by a fierce whirlwind.  Crushed boxes and half-sealed containers are piled into one corner, while tumbled stacks of paper litter a crevice-laden floor.  An elaborate painting dangles on a thin wire and is partially supported by a damaged rain barrel that rests directly beneath.",
