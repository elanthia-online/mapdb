      "The awakening scents of freshly roasted espresso and brown sugar fill the air in this cozy room.  A long maoral bar stands to one side, guarding an enormous brick-faced oven spanning the entire length of the wall.  Scattered throughout the room are several mismatched tables and chairs in a variety of arrangements.  The remaining walls boast a curated selection of small artworks and a floor-to-ceiling tapestry.  A silvered faewood bin rests below a large mounted blackboard just to the left of a green and silver chevron patterned curtain."
