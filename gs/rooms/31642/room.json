      "A small glass-paned door faces an elongated row of unkempt hedges, their broken twigs bent at abnormal upward angles toward the weeping willow trees obscuring the sky above.  The uneven sound of water gurgles out of a statue-flanked fountain, the liquid barely reaching the rotted wood planter perched above the irrigation, filled with a variety of sickly white and green flowers.  A variety of hempen ropes hang from the wood-planked awning, their knotted lengths suspending doll-like figures made from rose stems."
