      "The cozy cottage is furnished with aged, yet well-kept furniture and a luxurious ivory rug with a lotus flower pattern picked out in delicate blue threading.  A low mahogany settee with clawed feet is positioned near the dressing rooms and a large gown rack sits by a slender oval mirror.  An accessories table features several shoes and purses."
