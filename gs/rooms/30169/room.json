      "Singed cook pots and blackened pans hang from stout pegs on one wall above a silver-hued willow table laid out with fresh water pitchers, tin cups, and mismatched silver cutlery.  A cook sits on a silver-hued willow bench peeling potatoes into a large stewpot, his apron stained dark with blood.  The smell of roasting meat wafts in from the galley."
