      "The intersection was apparently once well-traveled, judging from a collective of ruined buildings standing around it.  A derelict inn still maintains a stand against the barrage of prairie grass and elements, with a weathered sign hanging by a single ring above its door.  The castle dominates the horizon to the north, silhouetted against the night sky.",

The castle dominates the horizon to the north, its ramparts surrounded by flocks of crows that circle it like a pestilence of rapacious insects."
