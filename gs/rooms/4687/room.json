      "Beautifully rendered watercolor and oil paintings adorn the silver-speckled marble walls.  Cushioned benches offer a grand view of the heavily trafficked foyer while a banistered oak stairway leads off to other attractions of the Naerine Hostelry.  Faint sounds of rushing water can be heard through a set of glaes-paned doors leading out to the bailey."
