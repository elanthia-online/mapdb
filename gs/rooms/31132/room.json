      "The walls are painted a pale golden hue with portraits of family and friends on all.  A cushioned bench sits opposite of a large soft feather bed, its head and footboards made of intertwined haon branches.  Various instruments hang from pegs, with a golden concert-sized harp taking pride of place before a window.  Bookcases line one wall, stuffed with music books and volumes of collected lore."
