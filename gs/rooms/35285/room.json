      "Bordered by tobacco wood benches, a narrow half-shell shelter housing a statue of Ronan sits along the northern edges of the travertine and red marl avenue under star-filled skies.  Blossoms of evening primrose, nocturnum orchids, night phlox, and deer-horn cactus lift their petals, heads held high in the cool night air.  Candles scattered throughout the shelter cast flickering light upon the pavers and form dancing shadows against the shelter's walls.  Opposite, a modest shop is surrounded by lofty junipers."
