      "An icy-blue glaes basin sits on a round, finely-carved tanik table placed at this room's exact center.  A heavy, cool mist billows off the water contained in the basin, making the room chill and damp.  Behind the basin is a tall marble statue fashioned to resemble Koar, with a medallion wrapped around its shoulders.  The walls are draped with heavy, blue tapestries.  The floor is bare stone, worn to almost icy smoothness by the passage of many booted feet."
