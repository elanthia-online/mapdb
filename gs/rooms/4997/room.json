      "The trail slopes steeply down to the east, descending into a lush, wooded valley.  Bright green fireflies flicker among the ferns that line the shaded path.  Far to the east, a vast moonlit expanse of tree-dotted grassland and distant mist-shrouded moors can be glimpsed through the branches.",
