      "Clouds drift by, pushed by a breeze that slips through the area and sets the pine trees to the east swaying and causes the water upon the nearby pond to ripple.  Shrubs laden with blueberries grow in the spaces between the dark trunks, while tiny rivulets of water break off from the pond to slip between them.  Several hollow reeds clack against one another at the water's edge."
