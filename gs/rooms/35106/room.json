      "Fire burns brightly in the small hearth opposite the entrance of the manse, its too-red hue bathing the dark stone of the foyer in dancing light.  Walls of basalt are riddled with impurities that manifest as deep maroon swirls on their surface, a languid pattern that is repeated in the polished black marble of the floor.  Masks hang from the walls, but they are of simple make, brightly painted wood and leather not matching the relative finery of the chamber that they decorate."
