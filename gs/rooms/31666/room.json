      "At the base of the slope, a thin stream of violet-sparked ultramarine water springs forth, creating a narrow brook that twists along between patches of misty pink dreamphlox and beneath fallen tree limbs that serve as cover for clusters of wisp-drawn dark cyan mistblooms.  The air has a haze to it, tiny spores from various mushrooms drifting along that capture the ambient cotton candy-hued light and hold it for as far as the eye can see."
