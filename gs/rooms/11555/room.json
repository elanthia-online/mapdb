      "Small, wave-rounded, black and grey stones mix with coarse blackish sand to form a tall berm.  The furtive sound of scuttling claws over the moonlit stones sounds like the rattling of bones.  A badly damaged ship lies to the west, careened on the beach.  To the east, a path takes a circuitous route up the sides of the dark dunes to the headlands above.  Stacked on one side of the berm is a pile of coral, forming a simple burial marker.",
      "Small, wave-rounded, black and grey stones mix with coarse blackish sand to form a tall berm.  Small mottle-shelled crabs skittle frantically across the sand.  Gulls wheel and dart, diving down to snatch at the small crabs.  A badly damaged ship lies to the west, careened on the beach.  To the east, a path takes a circuitous route up the sides of the dark dunes to the headlands above.  Stacked on one side of the berm is a pile of coral, forming a simple burial marker."
