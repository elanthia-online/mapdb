      "Posts of dark mahogany support the vaulted ceiling of the spacious hall, while some large paned windows allow the island moonlight to lighten the room.  A dark oak banquet table occupies the center of the hall, large enough to comfortably seat two dozen people.  Gold-framed paintings hang on each side of the entrance to a long hallway."
