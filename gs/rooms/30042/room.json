      "Aurora-lit twilight pours in through the arch at the end of the walkway, a crumbling work of heavily pocked red stone.  The stones in the eastern wall have buckled, causing a small cave in, but the ceiling still holds.  A trailing bit of silvery, translucent goo hangs from the zenith of the archway, drifting sluggishly in the gale howling through the aperture."
