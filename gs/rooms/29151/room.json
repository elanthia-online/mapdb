      "Stretching out into the ocean, the long pier stabs through the water on a southeasterly track and provides a panoramic view of the entire dock system from shore to sea.  Faded green rope is tightly woven around the tops of nearby tie pilings, the lower half of which is covered in mooring hitches that have been cut free of their ships.  A painted square of verdant green and bright white letters proclaims this section of the pier as \"Pier 3 - Slips 6-10.\""
