      "A snarling troll king mask hangs on one of the polished oak walls, and a pebble textured ceiling rises overhead.  An open-mawed greater vruul statue sits in one corner of a polished oak floor.  There is a gilded maple table on one side of the shop and a glass-topped mistwood counter on the other."
