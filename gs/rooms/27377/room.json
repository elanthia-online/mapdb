      "Fashioned of dark green walls, the room is small with a sloping ceiling of weathered leather and rawhide.  Near the entry flap is a simple basket-covered table and a plain wooden bench, while several sleeping furs are neatly arranged near the outer wall.  A hanging lantern casts odd shadows on the floor, which is covered by a thick patterned wool blanket."
