    "description": [
      "The air within the wagon's burnt orange walls is warmed by a long-piped wood stove tucked into a far corner, atop which sits a tiny, simmering pot filled with apple slices, cinnamon sticks, whole cloves, orange peels, and star anise that fragrance the steam as it rises.  Every breath is spiced and rich, like pumpkin pie and mulled cider, and a chill trickle of air seeping in from around the door teases the burgundy cotton curtains as it passes on its way deeper into the wagon."
