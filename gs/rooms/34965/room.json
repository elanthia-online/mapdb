      "Open, airy windows are framed by sheer ivory curtains that flutter in the salty breeze coming from the harbor.  A large teak writing desk dominates the center of the room, its surface scattered with parchment, quills, and pots of ink.  Displays of signet rings are arranged along the walls, while sticks of wax, paper rolls, and inkwells are neatly displayed on a series of shelves.  Ceramic lamps hang on pewter chains from the arched ceiling above, casting a gentle glow over the shop."
