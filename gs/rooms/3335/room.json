      "A collapsed building lies across the former roadway, rerouting it to the southeast.  The brickwork and wood that once supported the structure bear burn marks on what was obviously the former interior of the building.  The fence that lined the yard is now bent beyond repair, strangely left there by the street cleaning crew."
