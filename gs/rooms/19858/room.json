      "Swathed in curtains of verdant green, this gallery bears no ceiling, leaving it constantly open to the light.  A large iron cauldron dominates the center of the gallery, suspended over a firepit by a heavy trammel.  A bronze rack is pushed against the curtained pillars, bearing various implements needed for training."
