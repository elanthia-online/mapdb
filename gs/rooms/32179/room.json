      "Silver hoops of varying sizes, within which stretch multitonal floral doilies, hang from overhead beams by twisted hemp cord.  Scattered across warped, and somewhat rotted, floorboards are overstuffed crocheted cushions dyed a dark mulberry red and sewn with intricate beadwork along the edge.  Beside a garland-framed arch, an unsteady pillar displays a large fishbowl filled with murky green water."
