      "Vibrant fuchsia pillars are spaced regularly around this ostentatious salon which has been painted dark magenta with silver-lined leopard spots.  The stylized, butterfly-like eyelashes painted on the polished white floor are echoed in many mismatched argent mirrors suspended from the network of platinum chains criss-crossing the ceiling.  Slender pedestals of carved crystal display a menagerie of bejeweled cages."
