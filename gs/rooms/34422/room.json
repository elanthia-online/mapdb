      "Azure and gold fleck the thick alabaster wool carpet that covers the floor of the small room.  Several silver candelabra are placed about, their thick beeswax candles fill the room with a natural, sweet scent as well as brightly illuminate a narrow marble worktable.  Pale blue satin lines the walls of the area, their lengths shimmering in the luminous glow."
