    "description": [
      "The warm air of the greenhouse is sweetened by perfume from exotic plants blossoming throughout the large enclosure.  Smaller flower pots hang in tiered displays from the ceiling, while larger ones form sinuous aisles on the stone floor.  Most of the flowers growing are not native to the region, the bright petals of dragonstalks and honeysuckles suggesting origins rooted in warmer climes.  A wrought iron bench offers a place to rest and observe the verdant beauty."
