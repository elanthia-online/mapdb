      "Books and neatly stacked scroll tubes cram every crevice of the shelves above and to either side of a yawning fireplace of crimson-shot grey marble in the western wall.  Comical grotesques cavort before the hearth as if in celebration of its majesty, their features wildly varied but similar in that none stand more than a foot tall.  Encircling the fireplace is a ring of comfortably upholstered chairs in the same scarlet and grey hues as the window curtains."
