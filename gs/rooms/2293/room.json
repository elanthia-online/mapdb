      "Dry dust clogs your throat as you stumble farther along the ramp.  Your breathing becomes labored as clouds of dust rise with every step.  Even when you stand perfectly still to let the dust settle, something else seems to be continuously stirring up the powdery substance on the floor.  At the bottom, the ramp ends in a solid stone wall."
