      "Shadows encase every nook and cranny of the Teeth of Charl jutting out above the murky waterline.  One such shard provides a shelf for an altar that is surrounded by hundreds of tiny carved ships and floral memorials.  The shafts of moonlight penetrating the night clouds seem to target the area, glistening against the sea spray that has accumulated."
