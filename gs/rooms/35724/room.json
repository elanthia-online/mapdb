      "A circle of blackened stones encloses a bed of ashen embers, long cold and interspersed with fallen leaves and drying blossoms.  Scorched feathers cling to the rim stones, and a faint, dry tang of smoke still lingers in the air.  The surrounding rock walls are stained black with soot where they are not streaked with browning lichen."
