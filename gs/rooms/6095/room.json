      "Pale flecks of soot drift through the air here and there, dusting the ground with a light coating of grey.  The red dirt mound that towers above you is covered in places with ash, parts of its craggy, misshapen surface almost resembling the snow-covered slopes of a large mountain.  That illusion is quickly broken by sinuous waves of heat that occasionally blur and distort its outline as they rise upwards."
