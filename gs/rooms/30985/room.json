      "Golden knotwork runners trim the top of the yellow sandstone walls, interspersed with glowing frosted orbs that light up the interior.  Pewter creepers, crafted to resemble olive vines, outline a pair of ivory-handled teak doors, flowing down to the floor and decorating the walls with a variety of jade and onyx olives.  To one side, a set of smooth shelves carved into the yellow sandstone provide a stark contrast to a glass-paned polished oak cabinet pushed up against the far wall.  At the rear of the shop, an iron-wrought spiral staircase ascends to the floor above."
