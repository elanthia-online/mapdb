      "Fluffing their feathers against the cool night air, large seabirds huddle together on the large boulders shoring up the sturdy ground leading to the jungle.  Activity is minimal; the only noticeable movement is the unceasing ocean as it laps at the rocky shore.  Turned obsidian black by the night sky, the sea spreads out like a murky blanket into the horizon.  Looming to the north, a thick wall of darkness marks the shadowed jungle flora.",
      "Making use of the large boulders shoring up the sturdy ground leading to the jungle, large seabirds bombard the rocky coast with clams and mussels.  Dodging talons and falling debris, small rodents race in and out of the rocks, stopping momentarily to gather seeds and pods before disappearing into their burrows.  Far out to sea, the ocean shifts from azure to a slate grey hue while along the coast to the north, vibrant jungle flora gleams like a glistening emerald in the sun."
