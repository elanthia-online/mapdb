      "The deck slants to starboard, making footing awkward.  The mainmast, shattered just above the deckline, angles downward through a splintered bulwark toward the reef below.  Rigging, useless now, lies coiled and scattered around the deck.  The oaken hatchway into the forecastle has been torn partially from its hinges."
