      "A grand, double staircase leads up to the administrative offices of the Warrior Guild of Ta'Illistim.  Mica-flecked blue granite floors lead to fine, maoral-paneled walls, each bedecked with a suit of armor.  To the east, the guild's distinctive task offices are plainly visible through a wide marble arch and easily accesible to all guild members."
