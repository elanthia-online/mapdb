      "The air of the street faintly crackles with energy washing off of carved idols spaced between its low edifices of black stone.  Old beyond reckoning, the carvings are vaguely humanoid and worked of a waxy black rock that does not appear native to the island.  Cobblestones glisten under dim lantern light, damp from mist.  Merchants along the street proudly display their wares from candlelit windows: rare treasures wrested from the sea, shimmering jewels, and weathered maps promising a way to untamed lands."
