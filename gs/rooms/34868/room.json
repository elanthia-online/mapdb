      "Cat's claw vines snake through every gap in the latticework of pale linden that composes the spacious gazebo, smothering any light from outside.  Wrought iron planters cling to the walls, each cradling an unusual miniature tree.  Some pierced bronze lanterns shaped like pointed stars swing from the ceiling, casting a soft purple glow from the crystalline nodules within.  Discreetly tucked in one corner, a smooth bloodletting basin rests on clawed feet, its surface slick with traces of a dark, viscous substance."
