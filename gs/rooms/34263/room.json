    "description": [
      "Far below the length of the bridge, chitinous bodies crawl with inhuman grace over waxy cells, the uncapped ones holding pools of amber jelly in which kiramon larvae squirm and twitch.  Illumination from the gigantic spar of crystal near the center of the grotto melds with the pulsating light of smaller crystals, washing the bridge in harsh hues.  Noxious vapors surge up from thermal vents in stifling waves, hot enough to make the air warp and shimmer."
