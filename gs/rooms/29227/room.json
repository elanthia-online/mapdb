      "Deep ruts scored into the mud and heavily trampled grasses are all that remain of what appears to have once been pristine earth.  Circular stumps, some fairly large and others quite small, jut upwards in their severed stances.  A spindly game trail leads toward a road just visible to the south, and several small paths lead off in northerly directions for those venturing deeper into the forest."
