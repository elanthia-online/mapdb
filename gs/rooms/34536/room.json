      "Lining one wall of the spacious wagon is a long table centered with a narrow crystal vase filled with bright flowers.  Hanging from the rafters, bunches of blossoms peek from inside a woven reed basket, their rich colors creating a brilliant canopy.  Pale moonbeams trickle in through a series of skylights set in the ceiling above."
