      "Turning southeast, the dark coastline is rocky and unapproachable, except for a small beach to the north dotted with large volcanic rocks.  A dark cave opening is barely visible set against the moon drenched white sand, the entrance half-covered dark by forms unclear at this distance.  The hull of a large ship lies abandoned on the beach, only the ribs left after the decay of time and weather.  Several red buoys dot the water as a no trespass zone."
