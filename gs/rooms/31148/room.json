      "Descending as it makes its sway northwest, a natural wall of granite, feldspar, and slate blocks any southern view of your surroundings, while to the north the pathway opens up to provide a broader view of the mountains.  Low-lying bushes form small clusters in the moss-covered ground, which parts slightly for a trickling stream to slip through.  A light breeze, cool and fresh, tiptoes through the air."
