      "The street's shrubbery border ends on the western side, bumping to a halt against the corner of a low building jutting into its path.  Thick gray rocks, chipped into vaguely rectangular shapes, form a stout foundation, their robustly rough surfaces giving the structure an appearance of stability and strength.  Mortared solidly on top, smaller slabs taper slightly to a tarnished tin roof.  A squat stone chimney is perched haughtily at its peak."
