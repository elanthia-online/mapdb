      "Inlaid hunting cats of alternating amber and citrine gleam from the stark black sandstone walls enclosing the yard of a domed temple to the west.  A quartet of deep-graven slashes adorns the squared stone lintel over the grand bronze gates, which are graced by the forms of prowling felines.  Banyan trees stretch their branches over the wall, darkly shading the section of the way, and glimpses through the gates suggest lush grounds thick with overgrowth."
