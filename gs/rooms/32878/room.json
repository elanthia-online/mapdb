      "Bright white and navy blue bricks dominate the straight street, which is sheltered by the bulk of the New Ward Walls on the west.  Small shops and a cozy inn, each with pristine white stucco faces and wide paneless windows, face the street, their entries illuminated against the dark of night.  A series of potted urns of well-tended desert species rest near stone benches under flickering torches."
