      "Reeking of hot metal and smoke, the chamber centers around a tremendous steel-cased crucible reigning over a circular center island.  Molten metal surrounds the isle, pooling in an enormous basin.  Floor stones surrounding the lake of protometal are cracked and blistered, their centers incised with a hammer and anvil device."
