      "The forest to the west and the sweeping corn fields practically collide, with only a small amount of weed-infested space between them.  Dark spots on the trunks of nearby trees suggest that the forest was partially burned away just recently in order to reclaim farming land.  The corn stalks do not appear to be flourishing on the recently cleared land, but rather are surviving adequately.  Many of them have chewed leaves, but that is to be expected being so close to the herbivores' safe cover."
