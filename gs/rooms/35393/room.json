      "Muted tapestries of pale greens and golds hang from the dark paneled walls of the spacious wagon.  Flickering candle sconces illuminate the space, casting a soft, golden glow throughout.  Intricately carved wooden shelves hold an array of rings displayed on soft, rich fabrics with some featuring small glass cloches protecting particularly delicate or ornate pieces.  In one corner, there is a carved bench with cushions made from woven fabrics.  A small round table, displaying a selection of pouches, is set nearby."
