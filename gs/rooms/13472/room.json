    "description": [
      "Crates lie shattered upon the ground, the splintered wood only adding to the blanket of garbage and other debris scattered upon the cobblestones.  Dark sloping roofs crowd in on both northern and southern corners, their surfaces rotted and weathered by time's passage.  Thick moisture clouds the air here, and the pungent salty scent of the sea is readily noticed.  An alleyway is just visible among the crates, between two of the buildings on the north side of the Way."
