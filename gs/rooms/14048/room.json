      "Scattered about the area you see piles of broken weapons and armor.  Tarnished and nicked from battles past, many crests are represented, both attacker and defender.  Curiously, some items seem to be newer, without rust or stain.  A jumbled pile of shattered shields is pushed against the outer wall, their numbers so many it might represent the life's work of an armorer."
