      "Seashells trace a winding path through dense tropical growth.  Bougainvillea and jasmine spill in bright cascades among the leaves, filling the area with vivid color.  A mango tree spreads out alongside a sturdy wooden lodge, its curved fronds sheltering branches laden with ripening fruit.  Tucked amid the greenery is a stone house, its walls wrapped in flowering trumpet vines."
