      "A thick gathering of dark trees with spiked branches lines the innermost edges of the atoll, obscuring it from view and blocking access.  Obsidian stepping stones dot the pathway with lackadaisical irregularity, and a long streak of amber-hued sand stretches from path to ocean, its glittering surface rent by enormous claw marks.",
      "A small copse of dark trees with spiked branches blocks the center of the atoll.  Obsidian stepping stones stretch along a path in a lackadaisical fashion, while a long streak of amber-hued sand with large claw marks stretches out toward the ocean."
