      "Treacherous expanses of partially cooled lava lurk along the path, no longer aglow with heat but not yet solid enough to support meaningful weight.  They are indistinguishable from the ridges and swirls of more solid basalt deposited by the continuing pyroclasm that has consumed the surrounding plain.  Pools of lava bubble and churn, fed by constant upheavals beneath the wounded earth."
