      "In the shadowed nooks and crevices of a particularly high and craggy set of rocks rising proudly from the ocean's depths, seagulls sleep peacefully within their rookery.  The sound of the waves crashing against the teeth-like sentinels echoes loudly as the current churns, but unfortunately not even the strong scent of the sea can subdue the ammoniac smell of the guano left by the seagulls."
