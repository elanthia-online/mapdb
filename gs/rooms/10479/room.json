    "description": [
      "Dusty and overgrown with meadow grasses, the open interior of the dilapidated tool shed lies exposed to the harsh elements of the changing seasons.  Overhead, a view of the night sky is visible through the missing roof, and a few small bird nests lie ensconced in the upper corners of the badly weathered walls.  A rusted iron chain dangles from a fastener on one wall, its corroded links squealing as it sways back and forth in the slight breeze.",
