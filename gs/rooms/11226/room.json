      "The mist curls around you, taking almost familiar shapes.  Faces, figures and creatures seem to hang back at the edge of your vision.  As you near this small brick structure, you see that it still stands, mostly intact.  The only damage appears to be the result of time and neglect.  Too small to be a building, perhaps it was an oven or incinerator at one time."
