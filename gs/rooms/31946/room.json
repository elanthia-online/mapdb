      "Walnut bookshelves fill every wall making this narrow shop with a low ceiling a bit claustrophobic.  Though carpeted, the floor creaks and groans with every step.  Between two of the bookcases, a side door opens out to an open-air scrapyard.  A little more exploration reveals an almost hidden set of stairs that leads up to another space above.  A large casement window offers a view of the street outside next to the salon's threshold."
