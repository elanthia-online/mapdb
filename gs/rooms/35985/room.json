      "As your eyes adjust to the darkness you discover you are in a dank cave.  The lack of light makes it impossible to judge the room's immensity.  In the center, you make out the form of a large rock covered with bearskins.  Across from the rock bed, you see a firepit.  Off to the side, you see a ferocious grizzly bear."
