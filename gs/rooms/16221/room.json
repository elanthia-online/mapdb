      "Several large candles illuminate this small backroom with a flickering light.  You are able to make out the shapes of many bows hanging on the walls, some as large as a giantman, each an intricately carved work of art.  Bundles of arrows are propped in the corners, and a row of small barrels along one wall holds various types of crossbow bolts."
