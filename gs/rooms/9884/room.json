      "Within the forest's heart, the pungent mustiness of loam rules hand in hand with the relentless green of the woods.  A ragged path winds its way through boles of trees growing so closely together, they look almost like a solid wall.  Chinks of green light filter down from the intertwined branches overhead and sway gently at the prompt of a breeze, dappling the trail where it can be seen through the overhang of fern fronds.",
