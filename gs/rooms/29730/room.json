    "description": [
      "Speckled with dusky blue berries, juniper bushes crowd the southwestern edge of the corral's railing, swaying slightly with the alpine breeze.  Black sedge and blue-green grass spread across the ground in uneven tufts where the corral's denizens have nipped at their blades.  A southern paddock, accessed through a narrow gate, abuts the distant birch forest with its furthest railings."
