      "Four torches, burning with eerie blue flames, are anchored to the floor in each corner by onyx intaglio demons.  A sleek black marble table raises bubbling alembics, odd crucibles, and spell books within easy reach.  Opposite the table is a small lounging area, featuring a low witchwood serving table centered on a fluffy white polar bear rug scattered with oversized black velvet cushions.  Highlighted by scarlet despanal mosaic tiles, a polished obsidian sign is affixed to the wall."
