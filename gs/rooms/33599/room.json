      "Bisecting the overgrown topiary neatly in half, a jagged fracture lined with rough limestone blocks provides egress from the maze.  Thick strands of clinging ivy hug the various pieces and fairly choke the space with their broad leaves.  Small and large evergreens extend their feathery fingers across the area creating a shadowed environment that keeps the ambient light from completely penetrating."
