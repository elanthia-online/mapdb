    "description": [
      "Continuing along its east-west path, the north wall is covered in a thicker application of the brown moss which runs along the edges of the stones, outlining the individual blocks in dark fuzzy lines.  Closer to the ground, the moss has managed to bridge the gap between earth and stone, creating a soft base running along the wall's bottom.  Patches of bare stone appear in the thick moss where something has feasted on the abundant plant growth."
