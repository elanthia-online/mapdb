      "Huge gigas bodies are splayed in the snowy grasses beside a black stone well, anointed with oils to keep away rot and scavengers.  Their filmy eyes are open to the sky and the reflected aurora dances across the clouded surfaces, lending a mocking parody of life to the empty orbs.  Mist eddies around the bodies, tugging carelessly at fingers that will move no more."
