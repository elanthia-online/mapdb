      "Keeping the entire shop toasty and warm, an enormous fireplace occupies one entire wall of the kitchen and is filled with dozens of brick-lined baking alcoves.  Opposite, gleaming pot lids hang upon the wall amid various skillets, pots, and pans that are hung from simple iron hangers.  A long preparation counter, complete with a soapstone wash basin, rests near an archway leading into the shop, while a staircase topped with a niveous wool runner disappears into the owner's private quarters."
