      "Nestled against one wall, the atmosphere here is cozy and private.  A ceramic pitcher rests on top of the smoothly-hewn pale sycamore table and is filled to the brim with clippings from a thistle bush.  Warm red and golden glazes flow together to form a striated pattern reminiscent of a sunset over the ocean, and they provide a warm counterpart to the pale violet blossoms.  A small white votive is nestled within a russet glass jar, offset slightly from the pitcher."
