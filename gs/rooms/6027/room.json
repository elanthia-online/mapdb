      "The rounded tops of turnip roots protrude slightly from the loam in this garden area.  Though the area is littered with large rocks, the sandy consistency of the soil creates an excellent location for growing root crops.  The turnips are planted in long rows, with a foot or so between the rows.  In each row, the plants are spaced only a few inches apart.  Unfortunately, the weeds also find this sort of soil to be particularly inviting.",
