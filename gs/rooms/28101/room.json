      "Rafters of fresh pine support a peaked roof high overhead with colored pennants hanging in neat rows from the struts.  Open windows allow air, and the occasional local avian, to circulate freely above.  The ground is a soft loamy soil over hard-packed earth with numerous hoofprints radiating in wide circles around the center of the arena.  You also see a young stablehand and a long wooden gate leading back to the stable",
