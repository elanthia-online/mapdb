      "Starlight cascades across the granite cliff-face to the south, the feldspar, mica, and quartz granules within its upper reaches glittering in the silvery light.  Boulders, evidence of an ancient rockslide, form a semicircle barrier against the edge of the cliff, while tufts of emerald green grass grow at uneven heights throughout the space.  Resembling a roaring waterfall, woodbine tumbles down the cliff-face prominently displaying its ruby red, flame-hued tangerine, and burgundy compound leaflets."
