      "Carved out of the sloping hilltop and facing east, this lounge appears three-sided at first.  Then you realize one entire wall is covered with a nearly invisible crystal window that overlooks a breathtaking view of nearby pine trees that sway their branches gratefully in rhythm to the cool breeze.  Two doors lead east and west."
