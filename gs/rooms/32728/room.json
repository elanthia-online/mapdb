      "Plush, navy blue wall-to-wall carpeting muffles the steps of any who enter the room.  Overhead, a softly swaying crystal chandelier emits soft chimes.  Numerous low-backed cushioned chairs fill the floor space and standing between each chair is a small table.  Resting in the center of each table are delicate vases, each holding a yellow rose.  At the head of the room, a podium stands on a slightly raised dais with an even number of seats on each side."
