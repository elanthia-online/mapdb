      "Substantial cracks in the southern wall allow adequate natural light to spill in and assist with visibility for travel through the excavated east-west tunnel.  Ground rubble is disturbed with each step and scatters rock flour mixed with dark hair fibers into the air, while ominous howls echo back and forth through the halls like bantering and conspiring predators."
