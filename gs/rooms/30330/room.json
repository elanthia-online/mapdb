      "Tumultuous storm clouds fashioned of dark-stained teak lazily drift across the frost-covered deck, the stylized spectres hidden beneath small piles of snow shoveled to the sides.   Copper lanterns are evenly spaced upon the railing, their frost-covered frames and supports stand at alternating intervals between the round shields attached to the short wall.  Long rows have incredibly long oars bracketed to their backs, each oar wrapped tightly in red-colored oilcloth."
