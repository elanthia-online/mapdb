      "Skeletal and greying conifers cast a heavy shadow over a weather-worn runestone just off the edge of the trailway.  The old monolith has been forced askew by the shifting of the chill earth, and it stands at a miserable angle, pointing into the dead trees.  A faint odor of death lingers on the bitter air, and the keening of the breeze is like a banshee's wail."
