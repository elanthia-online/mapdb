      "Dark and squat, a makeshift alcove has been gouged into the wall of the shed to create this tiny nook.  While there is little space to move, enough room has been made to house a low ivory shrine against one wall.  The air is stuffy and humid, the overpowering smell of mildew pervasive in the cramped quarters."
