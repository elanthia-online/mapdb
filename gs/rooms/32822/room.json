      "Sturdy wooden planks extend out to cover the rectangular roof of the Municipal Building below.  The cavern ceiling overhead is close enough to touch, while down below dwarves are seen coming and going, some entering and exiting the building on official business.  A strong ironwood beam structure suspends a large invar bell next to a long invar horn cradled in a similar supporting frame.  A ladder leads through a trapdoor back down into the building below."
