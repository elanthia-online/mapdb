      "Rough stone walls enclose a broad cavern, their surfaces cloaked in algae and dark kelp.  Nets of coarse hemp are strung between jutting rocks, heavy with mesh bags and dangling baubles.  Wavering bands of light filter down from a crack high above, casting shifting patterns across a sandy floor strewn with stones and shells.  Glass floats, driftwood charms, battered shells, and strands of knotted cord sway in the shifting current, their slow movements casting faint trails in the sand."
