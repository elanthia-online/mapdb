      "Brightly painted cobblestones in red, blue, gold, and green transition into a sandy path to the north.  Jutting out into the pathway here and there, razor grass lines the path interspersed with stems of torch ginger, their blooms a brilliant red.  Obviously well traveled, the sandy part of the path is well packed into an almost rock-like surface.",
      "Mullein torches have been set out to light the way and illuminate the brightly painted cobblestones.  Jutting out into the pathway here and there, razor grass lines the path interspersed with stems of torch ginger, their blooms a brilliant red.  Obviously well traveled, the sandy part of the path to the north is well packed into an almost rock-like surface."
