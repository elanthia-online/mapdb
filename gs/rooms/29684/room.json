      "Strings of beads hang from every wall of this small pavilion, accenting the colorful silk with gaudy pops of color at random intervals.  A long table, its surface home to a branching silver jewelry tree and a squat wooden box, takes up most of the room, while a wide glass display case is squeezed next to it.  Various rugs and pillows decorate the floor, each one a different fabric or texture."
