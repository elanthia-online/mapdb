      "Giant horsetail ferns rise in a straight and sturdy manner toward the sky.  Whorls of soft, needlelike branches radiate outward at even intervals off the multi-ribbed stem.  What little moonlight is able to penetrate the greenery is reflected by the somewhat glossy surface of the moisture-laden ground underfoot."
