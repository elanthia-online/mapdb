      "A circular stone fountain stands at a bend in the corridor, choked with a profusion of orchids in every shade between snow white and lilac.  The underside of the bowl is elaborately etched with interlocking patterns.  Ferns flourish at its base, thriving in sunlight streaming down from a crack in the high ceiling, and insects hidden within their fronds hum in the sultry air."
