      "Paintings of fanciful trinkets and ostentatious adornments line the walls of the store, likely a mirror to the jewelry that once lined beds of black velvet near to the windows.  Not a trace of gold glistens within the looted shop.  Even the inlay on the counter has been pried free.  A sturdy modwir door in the rear of the shop is hacked and clawed, but stands fast, a testament to its sturdy wood.",
