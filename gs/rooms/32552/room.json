      "The low-roofed wagon's walls are painted in a dizzying array of gold and purple harlequin patterns, the diamonds curving and wending about the walls to create a disorienting optical illusion that makes them appear warped and skewed.  Bright brass shelves climb from floor to ceiling on the far wall, stacked neatly with gaily colored wrapping papers and gift boxes, while a hammered brass bucket piled high with ribbons in a dazzling assortment of hues sits just inside the door."
