      "Brilliantly colored nectar flowers nod slowly in the shifting air currents, raising their heads toward the sunlight.  Woody shrubs interspersed with flowering lilies and azaleas form a loose ring around the garden.  A shallow oval pond at the edge of the garden keeps the air moist and features a wide, sandy border, perfect for the puddling of butterflies.",
