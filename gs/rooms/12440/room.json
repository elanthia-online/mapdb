      "Dripping tallow candles cast a flickering yellow glow over the merchandise in Pollunk's store, the cool air and absence of any window lending the impression that his showroom is underground.  The walls, floor and ceiling are lined with a fascinating mosaic of wall materials, each glinting sample expertly interlocked with the next to form a seamless, cave-like interior."
