      "Canopic jars line shelves along the western wall, formed of a thick, smoky crystal that is blacker than the dark glaes of the walls.  There are larger relics as well.  Mounted on the northern wall is what remains of a singularly massive reptilian skull, its age-darkened bones and jagged teeth those of a powerful predator.  Opposite it, in a case lined with charcoal grey velvet, is a strip of glittering hide that is swathed in shadows."
