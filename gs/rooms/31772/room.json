      "Twilight hues spill through scarf-wrapped polished glass windows that line the pale blue walls, casting the room in gradient shades of violet, cerulean, and coral.  Velveteen divans and an oversized oiled leather armchair surround a grate-covered brick fireplace that occupies an interior wall, while a bundle of wooden sticks rests near the entry.  Baubles and knickknacks decorate the towering bookcase that rests against the northern wall."
