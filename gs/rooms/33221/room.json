      "Serving as a focal point for the galley, a picture window with a planter box of verdant occupants spans the length of the preparation counter and allows a pleasing view of the River's Rest environs.  Brightly polished, copper pots and pans hang on racks overhead, and several shelves house a plethora of dishes and flatware.  In one corner rests a large porcelain sink and opposite it sits a solid oak pantry.  Sunlight glints off the copper above, casting a cheerful glow about the galley."
