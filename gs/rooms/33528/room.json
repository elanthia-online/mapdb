      "The colorful brocade walls are affixed with angular ice cream dishes piling toppings into open hollow hands crafted from bright ceramics.  A hat-wearing capybara of clay stands in the middle of wood-planked floor, the upright rodent grasping twin glass trays between its claws.  Garlands of vellum-crafted ice cream scoops are draped across the walls, linked by tiny wood-carved cones, the decorations swaying with the ambient breeze."
