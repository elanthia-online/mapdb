      "Pale decorations continue to underwhelm here, forcing the focus on a large pale maple display at the center of the room.  Odds and ends of old ephemera set within a mix of mismatched picture frames are arranged in clusters on various decorative tables set between a grouping of red velvet chairs and an arrangement of yellow velvet chairs.  Some of them contain faded paintings of people in all kinds of customed dress, while several are stylized drawings of various animals in poses."
