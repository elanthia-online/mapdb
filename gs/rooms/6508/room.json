      "The rhythmic chirping of crickets creates a backdrop for a tranquil glade.  The trees ring a circle carpeted with leaves interspersed with the dark, blue-purple of woodland violets peeking through.  On the glade's opposite side, the trail meanders off and disappears into the trees.  However, a large, fallen tree-trunk lying across the path blocks any further passage.",
