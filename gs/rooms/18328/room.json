      "Moonlight breaks through the branches of trees further north to illuminate the glass-like surface of the lagoon with glistening brilliance, while the depths dance with shadows.  Gentle breezes drifting through the area create ripples upon the water, mingling with the constant, yet languid, current brought on by the waterfall that feeds it.  An occasional screech of a nocturnal bird or rustle of a bush on the nearby shoreline pierces the quiet of the alcove."
