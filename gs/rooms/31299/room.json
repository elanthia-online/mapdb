      "A small congregation of ducks lies sleeping just off the path in this area, nestled amongst the deeper recesses of the grassy meadow.  The pathway branches here, allowing for passage around the pond while also winding towards a small copse of trees to the north.  A neatly tended garden of bright wildflowers sits across the trail from the sleeping ducks, suffusing the air with a light, delicate aroma."
