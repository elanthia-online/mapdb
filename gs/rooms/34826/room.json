      "Gentle hills roll beneath the auroral sky, the dusty earth mottled with sparse, yellowed grasses and the occasional sanguine flower patch.  A meandering muck-blocked streambed separates the fence-divided pastures from an imposing, fog-shrouded forest looming to the west.  Its open, white-framed doors slightly askew, a dark red stable stands at one corner, an empty rusty steel trough set along one of the warped and peeling walls."
