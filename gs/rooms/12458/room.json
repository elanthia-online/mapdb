      "A tulip field spreads out to the southwest, row upon row of solid colors neatly organized into a quilt of living color.  Small insects buzz about the delicate flowers, pollinating and feeding upon them from hop to hop.   Gardeners carefully tend to the plants, cautiously watering each individual stem."
