      "Away from the periphery of darkness, a lone sandstone slab protrudes from the floor within the brightly lit center of the room.  High above the slab is an invar ventilation shaft surrounded by quartz and glaes lanterns.  A gust of rushing wind occasionally reverberates down from the invar shaft."
