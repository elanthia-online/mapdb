      "Well-polished brass lamps cast light upon the modwir-paneled walls and blue carpeting.  In one corner a large potted plant sits in a brass planter.  Upon the one wall without a door, a collection of cutlasses hangs, ranging in size from a blade small enough for a child to hold, to one so large a giantman would have difficulty holding it."
