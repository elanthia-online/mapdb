      "Verdant green, sunny yellow, and rose red paint the eye of the father in an interwoven pattern of sun and rose symbols, its carved ring rising above stacked figures of shaggy ponies arranged in a vertical column.  A broad wool rug rug covers the entire floor, its dense weave forming a long rectangle that stretches from the entry to the central post.  Rafters slope downward in clean lines, their ends settling neatly into the painted ring overhead."
