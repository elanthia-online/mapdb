      "Though shadows encase the island, the vivid white hue of the pavilion and the equally white cliffs it is nestled against stand out in the glittering moonlight.  The shoreline of the cliffs features a pocket-sized sandy white beach, created by eons of waves washing in and out in the rhythm of the tide."
