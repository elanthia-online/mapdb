      "Water streams down from the ceiling above in quickly paced drops, splattering before gaining momentum and running to the east through the grooves carved in the stone floor.  A short set of descending stairs, half submerged below the high water level, leads to the northeast, while to the south, a single pillar has collapsed, but does not impede travel in that direction."
