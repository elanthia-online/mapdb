      "Large picture windows, to either side of oak double doors, afford a view of a footbridge over a shaded pond in the garden.  Rows of modwir benches, carved to resemble tangled vines, face a dark green marble altar.  Behind the altar is a pair of trees, entwined with rose vines.  The trees grow up through an oculus at the far end of the chapel.  Floral garlands, tied with colorful ribbons, hang on stacked stone walls.  Cut crystal oil lamps festoon the walls as well, the ambient light reflecting off of their faceted sides."
