    "description": [
      "The pure white expanse of snow tapers off as it reaches a broad, briskly flowing tributary that divides the unsettled wilderness from the cliff-nestled cove below.  Forming a gracefully arcing passage to the front gates ahead, a high-peaked white monir moon bridge is ornamented with the intricate carvings of shifting lunar phases.  Gleaming waterways branch throughout the town, all surging toward the unfathomable mass of the Great Western Sea just beyond the shoreline."
