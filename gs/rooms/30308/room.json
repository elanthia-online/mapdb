      "A large, woven palm leaf mat covers nearly all of the otherwise exposed hardscrabble floor, keeping dust and kicked up sand to a minimum.  Steeply sloped, faded blue canvas walls and a low, domed ceiling enclose a vibrant space filled with lengths of bright and airy fabrics draped from brushed copper racks.  Bifurcating the tent, a natural raffia privacy screen stands behind a short well-oiled acacia table."
