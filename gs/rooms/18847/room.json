      "A huge hall stretches before you.  The high walls of cherry mahogany reach upwards to a vaulted ceiling made of marble the color of shadows on a cold winter's evening.  A tiled floor of fine Lysierian slate etched with a magical pattern catches your eye.  You feel drawn towards a pulse of power coming from somewhere nearby."
