      "Sitting prominently in the center of the room is a glass counter with each inner shelf lined in an intertwining of glaes and gold.  The aroma of bacon and other various meats, grease, and sweets fill the air.  Polished walnut flooring continues here and is shiny enough to reflect the gold silk-covered walls."
