      "The pale ivory walls are broken halfway up by oak paneling along the bottom half of this section of the long hallway.  An expansive mahogany-framed painting is flanked by a verdigris-veined copper figure standing to one side, and a carved marble memorial on the other.   Hanging opposite, a series of gold-framed portraits lines the wall, interspersed with wrought iron oil lanterns that cast their golden glow on the room."
