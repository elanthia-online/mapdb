      "Stacks of scrolls totally obscure the surface of a large desk, while behind it stands a comfortable chair covered in well worn chintz.  In contrast, a work table stands to one side, nearly devoid of clutter.  A shelving unit, attached to the large palm behind it, contains alchemical reagents of every type.  The palm's fronds, and those of its nearby brethren, shade the area from both too much sun and the occasional shower."
