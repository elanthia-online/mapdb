      "A broken runestone stands along the treeline, its shattered tip littering the ground around it.  Drawn amateurishly into the ground at its base, as if scratched there by fingers despite the solid layer of frost coating the earth, is a sigil that looks like a scimitar.  Blood, hardened and dried into little blackish crystals, stains the drawing."
