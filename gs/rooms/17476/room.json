      "A vast forest of aspen trees, silver-barked with leaves of shimmering gold, stretches out from the hillock to the distant Dragonspine mountains in the east.  The shadowy forms of seven mighty modwir trees rise from amidst the wood, towering over the terrain.  Their translucent forms waver and shimmer in the perpetual winds blasting down from the mountain heights."
