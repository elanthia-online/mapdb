      "The size of a small building, the cloth walls of the tent are pulled tight and dyed a dark indigo hue and hold a few scorch marks along their surface.  Some gilt-hued racks are suspended from the pavilion's apex and a long black marble-topped counter stretches along the farthest end of the room.  Small crystalline bottles line a high wooden shelf, each container filled with a myriad of colorful motes of energy."
