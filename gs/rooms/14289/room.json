      "This large open yard is littered with the remnants of fallen stalls and shops.  Crumbling stone walls are all that remain of some of the larger stores, their glass windows shattered and strewn on the street.  There is little wood left, no doubt gone to feed the fire-pits that lie within the shells of the ruined buildings.  Scraps of cloth, once colorful but now torn and faded, flutter from old flagpoles overhead."
