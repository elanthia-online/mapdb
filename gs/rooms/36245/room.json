      "Just off the salon, a low balcony looks out over the gardens and spies part of the back terrace, as well as the expansive rolling hills of the countryside striped with vineyards and riparians.  Crickets fill the night air with their song, and the scent of earth, fresh water, and flowers float by.  Only big enough for a few people, no furnishings clutter this space, but several pots featuring showy flowers rest near the low wall."
