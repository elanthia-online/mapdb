      "From this vantage point, the view is unobscured above the bank of fog that has collected in the valley below, providing both an impeccable view of the illuminated tree tops of Bittermere Woods as well as the lazily pulsing flares of color within the mist.  Washed out by the grey-white, shades of pale blue, dusty green, and watery peach flash with a cadence like that of a heartbeat slowing to a stop."
