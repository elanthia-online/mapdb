      "Lent speed by their travel down the slopes of an ash-clad mountain to the north, lava flows surge in glowing channels, eating runnels out of the shattered earth.  The narrowest of trails threads between the lethal rivulets, winding northeast toward a high plateau overlooking the devastation.  The stones underfoot rumble ceaselessly, as if the earth below had a thudding, racing heartbeat."
