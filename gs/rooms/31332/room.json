      "Sheets of burlap have been wrapped around large chunks of stone and bound in place against the support beams of this makeshift hut.  Crates half-filled with stone surround a large hole in the ground to the east side of the building.  A crane system with pulleys and wheels has been built near the crater and currently has a wooden pallet hooked to the end of it."
