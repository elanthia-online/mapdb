      "The scent of old parchment and oiled leather fills the office's reception area.  Legal tomes in a variety of styles, bindings, and languages line bookshelves along the walls, and scarlet and black tapestries with gold embroidery hang between the furnishings.  Near to a paneled ebony door, an elm reception desk with widowwood panels stands guard, laden with a neat arrangement of inkpots, quills, and papers."
