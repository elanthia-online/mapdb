      "In each corner of this compact room sits a barrel filled with an assortment of weapons.  Moisture drips from the ceiling, making a splish when the drops hit small puddles that nourish the plant life breaking through the cobblestone floor.  Shelving has been nailed into the walls, supporting a variety of dried fruits and herbs."
