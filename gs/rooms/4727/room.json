    "description": [
      "The low-growing foliage is broken here, as if the run has been frequented by a pack of small animals.  Torn and scratched, the grey bark of the black oaks is damaged where the stout trunks near the ground.  Lichen and tree moss are prevalent, clinging to oak bark and small outcroppings of pale granite.  A vague, earthy odor hangs in the air, perhaps an emanation from the damp moss or upturned leaves."
