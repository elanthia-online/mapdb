      "Crowded bookshelves line three of the walls.  From massive tomes to small pamphlets, each text competes for space in which to display its recognizable or not-so-recognizable title.  In one corner a carved teak chair sits behind a matching desk.",
      "Majestic and spacious, this oval room is enclosed with mahogany wainscoting.  An arched bay window resides opposite a carved willow door, providing a sweeping view of Maelstrom Bay.  The focal point of the room is a claw-footed circular table of grand scale, surrounded by ten plush high-backed chairs.  A horizon of elaborate wrought iron sconces provides function and finish to the room."
