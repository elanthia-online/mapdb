      "Gnarled arboreal forms weep dark reddish purple leaves across the dirt path, the finger-like branches reaching out across the narrowing road as the foliage thickens.  Sinuous vines weave through the sparse vegetation of the patch of woods, ensnaring themselves along the iron and vaalin gate, the long spires hung with hand-carved totems.  An imposing stone mansion is visible through the melange of briars, the angled gables shadowing the gardens below."
