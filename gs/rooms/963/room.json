      "Skull-sized stones and gravel litter the passage, making movement through the tight cleft especially difficult.  As travelers carefully pick their way across the shifting ground beneath their feet, the grating sound of stone grinding against stone echoes through the pass.  A pile of large boulders blocks movement to the south."
