      "A heavy fog hangs above the dusky river quieting the incessant babbling of shallow waters along the stone-ridden shoreline.  Here and there, the parting mists unveil natural rock formations as works of art on display for passers-by.  One particularly large boulder resembles a horned gargoyle, its bat-like wings spread upward, disappearing into a cloud of grey mist."
