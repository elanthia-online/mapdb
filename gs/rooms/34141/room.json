      "Not too far to the west, a broad river sweeps across the region.  The thick mist covering the water occasionally parts to reveal rushing torrents of rapids, as the river pounds its way toward the human empire at the edge of the horizon.  Aspens, though sparse, grow between the hill and the river, and are intermingled with other trees."
