      "Row after row of rune-carved columns stand north to south along a polished marble floor.  Iron torch-filled sconces mounted on the west marble wall illuminate the columns with a soft golden light.  A clear area to the northwest can be seen through the stone pillars that support a white marble, rib-vaulted ceiling overhead."
