      "Lights seem to flicker and waver deep in the forest to the north, occasionally accompanied by snatches of song or laughter.  The trail moves in a northeast/southwest direction, skirting the edge of the forest.  To the southeast the grassy moor extends into a bank of mist, the tall, tightly bunched, wet grasses looking terribly uninviting.  Neither forest nor grassland appears to be a particularly hospitable place for travelers."
