      "Gold-flecked marble peeks from beneath a rich gold and crimson carpet that cushions the floor of the cozy boutique.  Several frosted crystal globes are suspended above a polished teak counter that runs the length of the room.  Various items for sale are displayed on a set of mistwood shelves.  Hanging next to a carved pale mistwood archway is a crystal wind chime."
