      "Matching the decor of the living room, cherrywood wainscoting below ivory plaster walls gives this narrow hallway an elegant look.  A polished haon door is set into the center of the hallway's south wall, while a felwood door stands opposite to the north.  The hallway ends well beyond these two at a multi-paned white door, where squares of sky are visible above the door's gathered curtain."
