      "Dark-paneled walls encompass the length of this hallway, with its floor a stretch of burnished grey wood.  Modwir-framed portraits are staggered along one wall, each one depicting the face of several founders.  A polished statue of a red marble lion is perched at the side of a wide staircase leading up."
