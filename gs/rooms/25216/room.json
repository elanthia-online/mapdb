      "The surroundings fade from the natural formations of a cavern to the smoothed, angular shape of a long hallway.  Emeralds set in sinuous patterns upon the wall glitter in the illumination cast from above.  Upon the north wall, a pair of massive bronze doors loom toward the ceiling, the gleaming surface of each engraved with interconnected patterns.  Two large sconces flank the entryway, the light from the flames reflecting off the lustrous surface of the highly polished floor."
