      "Bordered by blocky buildings of rough-hewn basalt, a teeming plaza is fed by several busy roads.  Seafarers mingle with brokers and traders amid the surging throng.  Fish in size from minnow to marlin are displayed on beds of gleaming crushed ice, while nearby, reavers furtively trade their spoils for coin.  Though the nearest building, a two-story auction house with a black, columned facade, has a stolid and foreboding look, the nearby stalls and tents come in a brawl of bright colors."
