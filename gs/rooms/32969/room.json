      "A sturdy haon table topped with a clear crystal round sits with its attendant chairs in a corner of the pub.  A close examination of the crystal's surface reveals a swirling pattern made from fern leaves and small pressed flowers, preserved between two identical circles of quartz by an artistically inclined craftsman."
