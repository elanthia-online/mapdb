      "A wide trail stretches across the barren courtyard from the portcullis to a low-slung keep, which bears a strong resemblance to a squatting toad.  The trail ends at a long vaulted passageway, opened like some unwholesome maw providing entry to the keep.  Reaching into the sky above the keep is a spindly tower, which points toward the mountain air like the finger of some forgotten, skeletal god."
