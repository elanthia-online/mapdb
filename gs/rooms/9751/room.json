      "The walls of the great tree stretch up into a gloomy half-light, here and there punctured by stark beams of colored light.  Whether the rays come from openings to the outside, or are generated in some fashion isn't certain.  Underfoot, an outcropping of the tree's wall comprises the floor.  It extends out in a polished, veined semicircle as though the wood was as malleable as clay when the landing was formed."
