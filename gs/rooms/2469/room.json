      "Hard-looking sylvankind and half-krolvin trappers, burdened with pelts and furs from the wilds beyond, trudge southeast toward the local furrier.  A raw timber cottage faces the street, the snow cleared from its front path.  The trilling of a flute drifts from the cottage's doorway, gently punctuating the din of the bazaar to the east.",
      "Passing merchants, laden with pelts of all shapes and sizes, trudge southeast towards Furryback's Pelt and Skin.  An earthen-worked cottage faces the street, the snow cleared from its front path.  The trilling sounds of a flute drift from the cottage's doorway.  To the east lie the sights and sounds of the Icemule Bazaar."
