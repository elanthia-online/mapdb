      "A chill breeze whips across the summit of this narrow onyx tower, seeking every opening in your clothing.  Unwavering in the wind, two slender black candles rest atop an obsidian altar, on either side of a massive tome encased in polished ebonwood.  Dark forests wreathed in mist cover the hills like a verdant carpet in all directions, surely old when the abbey was built."
