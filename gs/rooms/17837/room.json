      "This small entryway is scented with the aroma of fresh loam, no doubt from the muddy boots and gardening shoes lined up on a wooden rack against one wall.  Opposite the collection of shoes, a long, simply carved oak cloak rack supports a wide variety of brushed wool cloaks in all the colors of the autumn forest."
