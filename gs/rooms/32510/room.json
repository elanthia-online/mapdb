      "Plush deep blue carpet runs along the floor of the hallway, and several potted plants rest along the width.  Ornate silver sconces are set into the dark-paneled walls, their light mixed with the sunlight from wide window and brightening the area.  An oversized painting of Darkstone Bay hangs near a wide mahogany archway, from which the sound of revelry and clanking glasses echoes."
