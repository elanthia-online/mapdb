    "description": [
      "Winds scream about the peak of the rock talon that gives the island its name, tossing the stubborn grasses crowning the summit's small plateau.  An ornate seaglass altar stands forgotten, its base tangled with flowering vines, and atop it, held aloft by a twist of seaglass, is a clear glass orb that pulses with stormglow.  Ragged veils of swirling mist whirl around the summit, snagging on black crags and tracing patterns over the greenery.  They occlude all but the vaguest view of the island and the sea beyond."
