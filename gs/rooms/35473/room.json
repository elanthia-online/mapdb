      "Sturdy pale pine beams provide support for the ceiling and walls of this room carved deep into the glacier while leaving much of the ice uncovered, keeping the air chilled.  A glass chandelier hangs over the crystal bar that dominates the room, sending a kaleidoscope of color over everything.  Despite the chill, the plush chairs and divans invite you to linger until you're ready to traverse the narrow tunnel again."
