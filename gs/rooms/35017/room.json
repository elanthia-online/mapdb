      "A few larches and hoarbeams cluster together as if conspiring to break the incessant gale, but they can only charitably be described as a stand of trees.  Yellowing needles scatter over the road.  The trail continues to climb as the briny bite of the sea slowly surrenders to the fresh scents of evergreens and loam."
