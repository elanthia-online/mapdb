      "The valley opens wide, complete with swathes of verdant grass and low rocky platforms.  The dirt is stained black with blood in several spots, with faint trails leading away as if bodies were drug off by victorious predators.  The ground is littered with broken spearheads and arrows.  The first sign of stone buildings rise up ahead."
