      "An ornate hoarbeam desk and accompanying leather chair sit in the corner of the spacious chamber, flanked by a stack of heavy wooden crates to one side.  Much of the room is given over to a large model of Icemule Trace occupying a tiered depression in the chamber's floor.  Despite the plain stone structure of the surrounding armory, no expense appears to have been spared in the construction of the wooden models or the bright-colored map on which they rest."
