      "A draft from the open doorway stirs up a cloud of dust that makes you sneeze.  Looking around it is easy to see why: a thick layer of dust covers the hardwood floors and collects in the corners of the room.  Most of the furnishings have been removed over time, and now only a broken bed remains amid the debris and dirt."
