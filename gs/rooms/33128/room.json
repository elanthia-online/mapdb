      "A gentle breeze filters through this rustic area with a mild scent of flora.  Two walls have been paneled with pine, while the floor is covered with a lush forest green carpet.  An overhead lantern illuminates a circular polished rosewood bar with matching leather and cherrywood stools.  Two walls have been framed with a trellis interwoven with blue roses, but left open to nature with only a hand carved railing expanding across the bottom, with potted strawberry plants nestling in the corners.  Several overstuffed couches are placed throughout the room, with small tables beside them."
