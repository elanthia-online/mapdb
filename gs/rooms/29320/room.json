      "[A Makeshift Pavilion]"
    ],
    "description": [
      "A wide swathe of pale silks is draped from the back of a shuttered ebony wagon to the back of a pale linden wagon creating a makeshift pavilion amidst the caravan.  Underfoot, the hardpacked sand has been swept clean of all debris and plump floor cushions have been arranged atop woven jute rugs.  Tropical blooms in earthenware pots dot the perimeter, a salty seabreeze diffusing the scent of fresh hibiscus and passionflower."
