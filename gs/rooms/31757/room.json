      "Surrounded by floor-to-ceiling shelves, the thickly carpeted room has strategically placed frosted globes that illuminate a large black walnut desk.  A suit of antique armor rests in one corner, its breastplate reflecting the ambient light while its limbs remain in shadows.  Various collection jars, ancient manuscripts, and rawhide-wrapped bundles fill the shelves and give the air a slightly musty scent.",
