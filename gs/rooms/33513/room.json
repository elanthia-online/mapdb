    "description": [
      "A prime representation of gnomish artisanship, the inner workings of the carousel are laid bare behind the finely painted scenery panels in a jumble of gears, levers, and moving metal parts.  Amid bins overflowing with tools and barrels full of black grease, an old monir chariot has been repurposed into a bed for the operator.  A spiraling stairway winds around the enormous center pole supporting the roundabout, leading to a storage area above."
