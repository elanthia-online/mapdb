      "To the northwest, the tunnel slopes down towards a dimly lit lake, while to the northeast it inclines gently upward.  A little more light can be seen to the south.  The walls are wet with the sheen of water, which flows towards the northwestern tunnel.  A round door is set into the east wall, a small sign hanging from it."
