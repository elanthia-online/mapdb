      "Lavish curtains of black spidersilk with glimmering silver brocade trim hang before the windows of the long stateroom, the style of which is somewhere between an office and a den.  Priceless tapestries and paintings hang on the wall behind an imposing maple desk with bright purpleheart and holly inlay, where a sextant and antique compass sit amid a scatter of papers and blunt-nibbed quills.  Part of a kraken arm, immaculately preserved, hangs on a mounting board above the door."
