    "description": [
      "Polished wooden floors meet the convex walls that rise to a ceiling that gently flattens at the top to form a rotund little shop with old-fashioned charm.  Aged parchment posters line the walls, curling at the corners, while clear jars of sweets adorn the shelves between.  In the rear is a lengthy table set with a trio of deep slat wood baskets and a dark ivory parchment sign.  In the middle of the shop are a glass-topped counter and a long canopy-covered cart, standing back to back, immediately identifiable as the source of the sugary sweet scents in the air."
