      "A warm glow illuminates the white ash walls from the crystal sconces placed around the office, and the scent of pumpkin pie permeates the room.  Two comfortable chairs flank a small marble table in front of a large oak desk in the center of the room.  Bay windows line the curved walls, allowing sunlight to filter in.  A carpet-covered perch sits near one window, a small wooden cage by another.  The cage door is unlocked and opened, a tiny note left in its escaped occupant's place.  A pumpkin-hued ash door leads out."
