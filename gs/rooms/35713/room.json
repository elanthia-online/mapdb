      "Tall trees shade the rugged stone of the hills, sheltered enough from the stunting wind by higher hills to have grown to staggering heights.  One kapok tree scrapes the sky, faces carved into its lower trunks cast in shadow by its immense branches, which are strung with primitive ornaments made from bone, feather, and twine.  High overhead, crude platforms and thatch-roofed dwellings peek from within the foliage, nearly hidden by the dense greenery."
