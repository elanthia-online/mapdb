      "The western wall is partly consumed by a curtain of stringy goop and much of the stone is pocked and porous.  Its source appears to be a crack in the ceiling.  The rocked edges look to have been devoured by some caustic substance.   Some of the translucent threads cling to the westward edge of vast stone steps climbing toward the edifice's terraced second story."
