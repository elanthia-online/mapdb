      "The upper rail has fallen from a section of the fence nearby, and a cluster of flat, fan-shaped brown mushrooms has grown where the wood is nearest the ground.  From town, the faintest sounds of music and voices carry on the wind, so far away as to seem as the whispers of spirits on the air."
