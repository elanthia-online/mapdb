      "Sprawling across the southern terminus of the marl and travertine avenue is a single-story villa, its white stucco walls and terracotta roof visible in the moonlight against the dark blue sea behind it.  Shutter-framed, arched windows and wide doorways allow the sea breeze to enter the building.  Verandas featuring flowering vines of clematis and copper tea flowers decorate the front of the villa, while gardens filled with spiny restharrow, autumn squill, and craspedia create a diverse landscape."
