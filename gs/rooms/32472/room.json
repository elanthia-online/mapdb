      "An oversized four-poster bed occupies the far wall of the room, which is appliqued with patterns of falling sweetbriar petals in dark paint.  Ghostly veils of lace hang from the bed's curtain rods, making it look as if swathed in pale mist.  Near to the door sits a heavily adorned chest with a gilded padlock, its wrought golvern frame taking the form of interlocking brambles."
