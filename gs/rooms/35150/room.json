      "A single, small window near the ceiling lets in the barest hint of light, but niches carved into the dark stone walls hold squat candles augmenting the illumination.  Shelves cluttered with alembics, basalt mortar and pestles, and a number of crystals line the walls.  Sitting by itself on a dusty counter is a lichen-covered stone idol in the image of some sort of sea creature."
