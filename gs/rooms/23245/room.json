      "Directly in front of a needlepoint tapestry, a large crystal globe is suspended from a strong silver chain.  Built in bookshelves of darkly stained ash line the walls, broken only to allow passage in and out of the room.  A long burled walnut table sits squarely in the center of the room with several high-backed ladder chairs around it.  At the head of the table is a more ornate chair which boasts scrollwork arms and a carving of a shield in the top slat of its back."
