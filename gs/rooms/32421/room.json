      "A cemetery stretches along the side of the road, banks of rolling green grass concealing crooked headstones and plinths.  The largest of the memorials is a mausoleum of alabaster etched with a bas-relief of a surpassingly beautiful woman in a flowing gown.  Businesses seem to give the cemetery wide berth, though from the look of their shuttered windows and boarded doors, they are as dead as the graveyard's occupants."
