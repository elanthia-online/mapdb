      "A tall dented brass lantern casts warped images across the crumbling cottages scattered along the hillside, the green-black flame sputtering and hissing as wax bleeds down the pole to pool above the dirt.  Vibrant fireflies blink in and out of viewing as they dart through the broken window panes, exposing a large silhouette looming closer as the insects grow in number."
