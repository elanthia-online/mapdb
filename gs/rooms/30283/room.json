      "Several high-backed chairs hug the side walls of the cabin while a long glass-topped desk that stretches out before a row of tall arched windows overlooks part of the town and the bay.  A huge rust-covered bronze bird rests in one corner, opposite of it stands a salt-stained bookcase cluttered with tomes and trinkets.  Hanging on one wall are a heavy oak placard and a polished wooden weapon rack."
