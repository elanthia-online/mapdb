    "description": [
      "Coarsely textured to provide a sure footing, the whitewashed dock stretches outward from the verdant greenery of the island into the slightly choppy surf.  Pedal boats bob up and down at the edge of the structure in tandem to the delicate roll of the tide, their moorings clanking quietly from where they are anchored in place.  Covered in crushed, white shells, a small pathway winds its lazy way up a hill and deeper into the island."
