      "Set at intervals down the length of the stone hallway are a trio of recessed alcoves, each boasting a smoking censer atop a pedestal of whorled glaes.  Three of the niches are home to well-preserved tapestries.  Shafts of radiance spill through slits on the western wall, blazing bright through the wisps of incense smoke.  Near the end of the walk, a series of stone steps spirals up into the ceiling."
