      "Naturally flowing water spills down and around an extensive tumbling of sandstone rocks.  A single mimosa tree reaches an impressive height, bending its heavily laden boughs over a delicate mistwood bridge.  Elegantly arching over the spring, the bridge has a soft blonde color that stands out distinctly against a background of tall, slender grasses."
