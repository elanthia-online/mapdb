      "Sheltered in the shadows of the surrounding moutains, snow clings to the ground as it stretches across the mossy alpine landscape.  Three game trails converge within the center of the small clearing, though only one, which shows signs of recently being widened into a traversible path, continues upward towards the darker sections of Rumor Woods.  Colorful tents pop out of the aspen grove to the southwest, while shale and scrub brush occupy the northwesterly sections.",
