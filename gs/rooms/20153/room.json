      "The varnished mahogany walls enclosing the area are accentuated by the elegant ebonwood chairs set about the wagon.  A single chandelier casts illumination upon the center, highlighting the soft lamb's wool area rug occupying the floor.  A claw-footed table of mahogany rests on the rug, a tall-backed upholstered chair on either side."
