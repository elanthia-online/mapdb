      "The skeleton of a vast sea animal hangs from the ceiling by heavy chains of dark steel, and the lights of the chandeliers above filter through its ossified remains.  Dozens of leather-padded seats stand in neat rows before a raised lectern carved from ebony and inlaid with veins of ice blue mithril.  Behind stands a long, flat trestle table of the same dark wood, intricate carvings on its polished surface gleaming in the light of candles flickering through a stained glass window framing the rostrum."
