      "A monument of time-browned ivory stands to the side of the road.  The old scrimshaw illuminating its carved surface still possesses a rich cobalt hue that is unfaded by the passage of sunny days and cruel nights.  It rests in the shadows of short, crooked evergreens, red grasses growing thick at its base."
