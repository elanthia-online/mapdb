      "This room glows with a cheery warmth from the fireplace at one end.  As you enter, you feel a great sense of peace and serenity here that relaxes you and makes your cares dwindle.  A huge fur rug covers the floor in front of the fireplace and an equally large fourposter bed occupies much of the room.  Next to the bed sits a handsomely carved nightstand and beneath the leaded glass windows sits a plush love seat."
