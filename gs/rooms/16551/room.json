      "From the looks of the low curtained stage at the south end of the room and the rows of brocaded seats, this room appears to have been part of an old theater that at one time must have included the bar and surrounding areas as well.  The wooden wall that separates the meeting area from the bar bears a large map of Wehnimer's Landing, and dark tapestries cover the walls to both sides of the stage, muffling any noise from outside."
