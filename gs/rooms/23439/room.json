      "A single black lantern illuminates dark water stains meandering across pale pink rose-printed wallpaper that has begun to peel at the seams.  Across from the entry, a large brass-framed porthole with milky green glass overlooks a battered driftwood wardrobe set upon warped floorboards.  A frayed hammock dangles over a pair of salt-stained mistwood trunks in one corner, opposite a makeshift table and two mismatched wooden chairs."
