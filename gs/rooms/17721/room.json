      "Shards of crystal make up the walls, their glimmering facets pulsing through a range of brilliant hues every few moments.  Warped, mirrored reflections play across the slick surfaces of the walls, while a large pale sphere stands like a sentinel in the center of the room.  A wreath of sharp obelisk-shaped spires ring the sphere, and shrill notes of ethereal beauty echo forth from its interior as a silvery incandescence billows across its surface."
