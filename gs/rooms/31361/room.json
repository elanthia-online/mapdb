      "Neutral sand-hued stones pave the earthy ground and are punctuated by a mix of smaller blue-grey and ivory pebbles.  A series of decorative stone lanterns line a wide, silk-spread aisle, leading to a lush koi pond in front of an ornate mistwood altar.  Minimal flowerage exists within the verdure flourishing around the area, dotted only by sprays of woody indigo blossoms and nearly transparent white buds."
