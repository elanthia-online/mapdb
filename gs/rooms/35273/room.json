      "With its charcoal grey planks weathered by the sea, the dock is supported by white travertine pillars.  Clusters of barnacles cling to the lower sections of the pillars, their rough surfaces contrasting with the smooth stone above.  At the edge of the pier, a large coil of rope lies in a tangled heap."
