      "Tall shelves of fine-grained mahogany frame the curtain-draped windows of the small shop, the tone-on-tone brocade styled with local fauna highlighted in threads of gold.  A wide counter displays hand-sketched sheets of vellum beneath a pane of clear glass, the drawings bordered by an array of paint-dipped sticks showcasing available customizations.  Set above an antler-inked partition is an aged iron chisel, the tool displayed within a frame of lacquered lasimor."
