      "A narrow strip of land stretches out for a few hundred feet, roaring waves threatening to engulf it on every side.  To the east lies a row of battered ships, the broken vessels barely intact as their debris floats haphazardly in the murky waters.  Washed up on shore is a massive black warship, its entire length almost torn in two."
