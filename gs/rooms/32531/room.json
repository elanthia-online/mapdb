      "The broad sweep of the strewn pine floor is interrupted by a braided seagrass rug.  Halfway to the beam ceiling, a portrait of Darkstone Castle hangs on one of the knotty pine walls.  A gilded maple cabinet and an oval-shaped speckled marble counter are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
