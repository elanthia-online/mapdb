      "Plain brown fabric serves to cover the wooden slats that connect the platform around this part of the circle of trees.  Dense foliage above encloses the area, making it a bit more private.  At the center of the room, a leaf-covered woven basket hangs on a trio of thick ropes from a sloping branch, a tiny, shimmering sprite flitting near the wares within it."
