      "A tiered oaken rack rests between a pair of cobalt-curtained windows that offer a view of the port outside, flanked to one side by a carved oak armoire and to the other by a set of golden oak hooks.  A deep blue carpeted runner extends from the archway to the west to an elaborately carved oak door across the way."
