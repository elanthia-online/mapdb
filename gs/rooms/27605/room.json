      "Behind the counter that stretches from wall to wall in this modest shack is a bay window that offers a glimpse of the pier beyond.  Displays of fish hooks are mounted above the window, while ornamental fishing poles are arranged to frame either side.  On the opposite wall is a rhimar-lined bait box with a heavy lid set side-by-side with a tiered table stocked with a variety of lures and lines, while nearby is a fishing pole stand."
