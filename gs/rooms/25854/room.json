      "Slopping gently downward, a small pathway connects the garden above to the secluded beach.  Large and small rocks pockmark the shore, the sharp edges of the shoals making it impossible to swim in the water.  Moist sand stretches to the east and west causing the ground to feel spongy and soft."
