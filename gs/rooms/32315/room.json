      "Framed by overgrown fields dotted here and there with drifts of snow, the old farmhouse waiting at the end of the path has succumbed to decay.  The paint on the wooden siding has started to peel, revealing age-silvered spruce underneath.  Several of the windows are broken, giving glimpses of a dark interior full of warped wood and deep shadows.  The ceiling has collapsed in, barring entry through the red-limned front door, the knob of which is missing."
