      "Built along the south wall is a large wooden open-air structure.  Underneath its planked roof you see rows of steel cauldrons with long copper coils on top of them.  Underneath each cauldron is a shuttered brazier with numerous adjustment slots on the covering.  The smell of sour mash permeates the area.  Sitting just east of the cauldrons you see a rack that must have once held casks, but is now empty.  To the southwest, you see a stout wooden door leading into one of the castle towers."
