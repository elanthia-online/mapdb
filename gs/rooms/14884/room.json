      "The path ends here at a small sandy beach along the shore of a lake, the water looking deep and black in the darkness.  A light breeze sends the boughs of a nearby willow tree swaying and creates ripples on the dark surface.  Moonlight glints off the ripples in a dazzling display.  The occasional song of a distant night bird and the rhythmic sound of small waves lapping at the shore make this a peaceful resting spot.",

The occasional song of a distant bird and the rhythmic sound of small waves lapping at the shore make this a peaceful resting spot."
