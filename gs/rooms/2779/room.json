      "This is a warm domain of polished oak surfaces and clumps of sweet-smelling herbs hanging from low rafters.  Another of the generous hearths covers one wall, with a low sales-counter opposite it.  Shelves stretch from floor to ceiling behind the counter, filled with a variety of merchandise, and pastries line the counter-top in a tempting display."
