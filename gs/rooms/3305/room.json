      "Wind gusts down from the north, chilling the air along the roadway.  Sunshine reflects brilliantly off of the glacier, blazing like a beacon in the pale daylight.  Above, the temple rises above the town on a hill of colorless ice, watching over the city and shining like polished crystal.  Carillons sound in the distance, their imperious pealing rising above even the din of the road.",
      "The air takes on a definite chill here.  To the north, you can see the gleam of sunshine reflecting off ice, and it seems the road is headed straight into the glacier.  To the north and east, the Temple rises above the city on a hill of ice, watching over the city and shining like a polished crystal.",
      "The air takes on a definite chill here.  To the north, you can see the gleam of moonlight reflecting off ice, and it seems the road is headed straight into the glacier.  To the north and east, the Temple rises above the city on a hill of ice, watching over the city and shining like a polished crystal in the moonlight."
