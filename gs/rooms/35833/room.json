      "Bright pennants in mismatched hues drape from the pavilion's inner frame, their lengths swaying with each whisper of air.  Beneath them, polished stands present rows of long-toed poulaines, each pair arranged so the bell-tipped points curl upward in gleaming arcs.  Nearby, a series of polished racks bristle with doll-headed batons, their painted faces grinning in candlelit cheer as the faint sound of jingling echoes through the tent."
