      "Free from the hellish landscape beyond the sealed door to the south, the chamber is more tranquil than it appears to be.  A towering sculpture in the likeness of Marlu dominates the center of the sanctuary -- crafted from glossy black marble, time has worn its way through the rock, causing severe damage.  Much of its left wing and shoulder lie strewn across the western side of the room.  An archway to the north serves as the only exit."
