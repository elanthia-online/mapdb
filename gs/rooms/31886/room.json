      "A floor-to-ceiling chandelier of leaf-framed flora casts illuminated silhouettes against the blade-haloed rack set along the back wall, the display caught between twin tapestries of devore velvet, the heavy fabric pooling across the haon-planked floor.  In the center of the shop sits a rectangular glass tray nestled across the palm of a tall hand-carved display of bleached driftwood, the appendage covered in pyrographed sigils.  A yellow-eyed grey cat sits before several branch-framed mirrors to the left of the room, its reflection warped across the smooth surface."
