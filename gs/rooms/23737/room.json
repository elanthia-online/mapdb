      "Bars of tarnished brass line the face of the enclosed teller cage, with only a narrowed open space beneath for the exchange of notes and silvers.  A black walnut desktop serves as a writing space for notes and ledgers, but the amount of deep blue ink spilled upon the scuffed leather blotter casts doubt as to the wisdom of placing important papers on its surface."
