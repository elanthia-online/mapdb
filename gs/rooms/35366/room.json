      "Rising to teal-painted walls and a white stucco dome, this floor curves beneath a vast skylight, its iron framework supporting beveled glass panes that flood the space with sunlight.  Clover-shaped arches frame the upper level, their carved edges accentuating the graceful design while providing reading nooks amid the towering bookcases.  Railings trace the perimeter in intricate, ivy-like patterns, while twin staircases of dark-burled camphor descend in sweeping curves, leading to the level below."
