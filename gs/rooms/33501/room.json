      "Constructed from hardy oak and stained a golden honey color, narrow benches set on risers run the length of an elevated stand overlooking a dirt racing track.  Padded fleece cushions are strewn about the seating area, offering slight comfort and minimal warmth.  Mounted along the front rails, hunter green pennants whip and snap wildly in the cool breeze."
