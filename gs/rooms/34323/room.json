    "description": [
      "Short-lived glimpses of a jagged and rocky landscape below are quickly blotted out by fast-moving clouds that steal across the dark sky.  Limited visibility, disorienting fog, and relentless rain are ingredients for a precarious adventure and are available in abundance.  Hanging precariously on a branch that protrudes from a huge circular structure made from rotting sticks, mildewed stones, and other area fodder is a tattered satchel.  A rope bridge leads to the northern plateau."
