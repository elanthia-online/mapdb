      "An occasional flutter of sound marks the rapid passing of some small animal skittering its way through the surrounding vegetation.  Less easily heard, but more easily seen, is the pebbly-sided mound of a large ant hill.  Tiny black ants go about their daily business with military precision as they march in and out of the hole at the top of this miniature mountain.",
      "An occasional flutter of sound marks the rapid passing of some small animal skittering its way through the surrounding vegetation.  Silent, but more easily seen, is the pebbly-sided mound of a large ant hill.  No movement can be seen about the hill.  Most likely its inhabitants have retired for the night to earthen chambers below the ground."
