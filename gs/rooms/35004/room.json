      "Diverging from the even straightness of the cliff's edge, a grassy promontory juts southward to loom over the waters of the Frostmain.  At its southernmost tip stands a lighthouse built from local stone, the details of the weathered old building lost to the intervening distance.  Kittiwakes wheel overhead on currents of icy air, their brazen cries punctuating the dull roar of the far-off surf."
