      "Wrought iron lanterns hang overhead, casting warm illumination across an array of display cases that showcase refurbished wares.  Crushed velvet blankets, chosen for their neutral tone, rest beneath protective glass, letting each item stand out on its own merits.  The layout of the cases allows ample space for viewing, while windows set high along the walls invite a gentle breeze that brushes past decorative hangings."
