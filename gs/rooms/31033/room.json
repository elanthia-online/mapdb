      "Elegant brass sconces cast soothing light over smooth, onyx-swirled white marble walls.  Massive gold planters, brimming with brightly colored exotic plants, fill each corner.  A neatly engraved plaque reading \"After All is Wed and Done\" hangs over a carved arch, which is set into the eastern wall."
