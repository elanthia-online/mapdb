      "The topmost chamber of the tower benefits from the structure's domed roof, opening up the space to twice the height of the rooms below.  A ring of clerestory windows placed just beneath the cap of the dome itself let in a light tinged by their dark blue glass panes, a light which falls on the many banners and pennons hanging from the walls.  In the center of the chamber, a stairway spirals downward."
