      "Twin rows of skeletal trees line each side of the crossroads, their gnarled branches perched with dozens of crows, each one gazing down at the sigil-covered ground.  The faint cry high above reveals a duo of vultures, the predators circling lower with each flap of their wings above a circle of empty buildings."
