    "description": [
      "A large chimera statue stands sentinel over the houseboat, its cheerfully painted figure looming over the night-shadowed deck.  A twining leaf-painted door leads into the deck-level cabin, while a brushed steel ladder leads deeper into the interior.  Ocean droplets on leaves and petals glint in the starlight shining upon the numerous healing herbs and potted plants that ring the deck and cabin, and several different arkati icons are carved into the outer rail's posts."
