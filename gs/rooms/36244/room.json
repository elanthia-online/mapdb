      "Small and circular, the sitting room is comfortably furnished with overstuffed chairs and settees upholstered in onyx and crimson floral brocade.  Ebonwood tables rest next to each and vaalin oil lamps illuminate the room with a warm glow that matches the flames in the black marble fireplace.  Tall windows open up the western wall, while an archway to the west leads out to the main sections of the manse."
