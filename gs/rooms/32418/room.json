      "A cadaver hangs from the soot-blackened rafters of the smithy, his flesh ravaged with claw-marks and bites as if wild animals have been at the body.  The forge has been cold long enough to have a silvery coating of dust over it, and the leather of the nearby bellows is torn to shreds.  Weapon blades of iron and steel lie in a pile on the ground, fused together by rust."
