      "Smelling of dry hay and saddle soap, the stables are mostly unadorned.  A row of ten stalls with sliding wooden half-doors lines the far wall.  A massive pile of loose hay fills one end of the room, while the other sports a collection of saddles, tack, and one abused quintain.  Axe-hewn boards strewn with straw create a floor sturdy enough to stand the test of time against hooves and boots."
