      "Dappled sunlight spills through the verdant leaves shading this quiet alcove, creating a kaleidoscope of shadow on the rough-hewn floor.  Tucked in between slender branches and gnarled knots, partially obscured by the pale blush pink blossoms of a climbing bougainvillea, several wooden shelves seem to almost grow out of the rosewood tree itself.  Near a rustic arched arbor laden with vividly colorful flora, a pair of woven palm frond baskets, one on either side of a simple rope ladder leading up to a raised platform, hangs from a sturdy limb and sways softly in a gentle breeze."
