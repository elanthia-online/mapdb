      "The air in the cramped room is stale, with motes of dust seemingly suspended before a large and square wash basin, the sides of which are stained in shades of rust and crimson.  A mirror has been affixed above the basin, its clouded surface framed by a wren-carved border of ebonwood, where the avian wings are broken off and crushed upon the tiled floor.  Piles of rags lay abandoned in the darkest corner of the room, the torn strips shifting slightly in erratic patterns."
