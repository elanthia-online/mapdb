    "description": [
      "The heavily pigmented colors of the wooden floor and ceiling overhead retain much of their vibrancy, though it is obvious touch-ups have been applied where the color is ever so slightly off.  The hues add a cheery note to the ride, though buried beneath the light, plucky tune of the carousel music, there is a deeper, more halting sound, like the constant grate of metal on metal.  It is so low that it serves as little more than a background to the melody, a hint of sinister in the otherwise tinny tune."
