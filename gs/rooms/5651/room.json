      "Several large roots have been torn from the walls and are now being used to suspend wooden buckets from the ground.  Each of the containers is filled with brackish water, one of them with a rusted iron ladle hanging from its rim.  A tiny spring is bubbling softly in one corner, evidently the watering hole for the inhabitants of this warren."
