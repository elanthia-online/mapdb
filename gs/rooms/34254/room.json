      "Much of the terrace's strange stone is engulfed in a fibrous blanket of secretions.  Cyst-like swellings cradle the bases of tall, ovoid eggs, each nearly the height of a child and translucent enough to hint at a coiled form within.  Ooze seeps from their leathery surfaces, dripping in thick strings to puddle on the ground.  They reek powerfully of vinegar."
