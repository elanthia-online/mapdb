      "Emerald green Vornavian silk tapestries hang from the walls, their edges decorated with the embroidered image of local flowers, while their centers are emblazoned with a single ivory swan.  Smooth benches are arranged upon a three-step riser, providing a clear and easy view of the Great Hall below."
