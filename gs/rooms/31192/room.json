      "Supported by a towering tripod of roughly hewn oak poles, the peaked canvas tent has a single oil-filled lantern for light that is hung from an s-hook wedged into the tight cotton lashing.  Small, dimly lit orbs provide concentrated lighting close to the ground, where a geometric llama wool blanket supports specimen boards that rest against the beige walls and display a variety of insects.  Glass jars dangle from a series of stainless steel hooks by their handles near the exit."
