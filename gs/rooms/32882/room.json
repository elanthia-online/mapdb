      "Uplifted cobblestones, stacks of burnt pilings, and mangled bits of metal create a barricade to the southwest where the ragged gates and skeletal remains of Winter Manor rest lifeless and vacant.  Beyond the sloping hill, where once manicured lawns whither into yellow tufts, are the bones of the once bustling Iron Dock.  Citizens bustle along the street, averting their eyes from the historic destruction and ignoring a nearby jailhouse."
