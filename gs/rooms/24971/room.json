      "A spacious pavilion with a domed roof rises from a clearing in the pines down a winding path off of the cobblestone lane.  Patches of odd-shaped mushrooms in a range of colors sprout up along the path and continue along a rock wall in front of a sizable establishment constructed of timber and rough stone.  A threadbare standard hangs limply from a pole mounted to the doorpost."
