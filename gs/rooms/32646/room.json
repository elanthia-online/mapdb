      "Several large tureens sit on crisscrossed metal grids against the northern wall, though the grids and the tureens seem as warped as the wall itself.  Heavy metal lockers follow the contours of the southern wall.  No hinges or doors are apparent on the lockers, though, and they rest solidly against the granite surface that comprises the ceiling, walls and floor.  It is difficult to tell what color anything is for the lighting provided by the gelatinous trail on the ceiling is only electric blue."
