      "Tidy homes nestle together on either side of the roadway with candlelight peering out cheerily from several windows.  The road is wide and appears well traveled with the dirt packed down tightly.  The clouds pass overhead quickly, allowing patches of bright moonlight to illuminate the field to the west.  A snow fort, probably built by dwarven children during the day, is situated in the center of the field behind a large wooden structure.",
      "Tidy homes nestle together on either side of the roadway, their brightly colored doors and whitewashed fronts speaking of neat, meticulous ownership.  The road is wide and appears well traveled with the dirt packed down tightly.  A group of dwarven children appear to be constructing a snow fort in a field off to the west behind a large wooden structure.  Their laughter rings out musically in the interludes when the wind dies down to a sufficient level."
