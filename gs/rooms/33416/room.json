    "description": [
      "Leached of color due to exposure to the sun, wind, and salty sea air, worn greyish-white planks create a small pathway through the tangled clusters of sedge and sea grass that sprout up along the sandy terrain.  Small homes perch upon sand dunes, their backs to the beach and their doors opening to pebbled walkways that connect with the boardwalk.  Winding its sinuous way between the domiciles, a thin trail provides access to the beach."
