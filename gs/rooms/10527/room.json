      "Boldened by the protection offered under the moonless sky, the mewling of black caimans grows louder from the distance.  Decumbent vines cover the ground like a plush carpet, with their trifoliate leaves and oddly shaped white and green flowers that bear a strong likeness to a hooded figure.  Clusters of star-shaped, pink and purple flowers rise up from the water that is hidden by the vines.",

Clusters of star-shaped, pink and purple flowers rise up from the water that is hidden by the vines.  Multicolored funnel-shaped flowers coil upward and wrap themselves around a majority of the trees, giving them the appearance of wearing brightly colored coats."
