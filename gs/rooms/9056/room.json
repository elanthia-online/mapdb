      "The unadorned facade of a sturdy limestone building rises before you, its weathered surface broken only by several vertical slits in the ancient stone and a heavy mithril portcullis bearing an engraved brass plaque.  Well-groomed hedges fill the small flagstone courtyard with a peaceful scent of sunlit leaves, but the sounds of grunts and clashing weapons echoing from somewhere above dispel any sense of calm.",
