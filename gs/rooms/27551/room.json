      "Cutting a straight, wide line through the untamed grasses, the black sand pathway is lightened by bright white shells to the northwest and north, but darkens as it angles towards the sound of crashing waves.  Dried-out seaweed, splintered driftwood, and sturdy foundation stones lie scattered about the area indicating that habitats once stood here.  A heavy breeze passes through the area, carrying with it the dampness of the ocean.",
      "Cutting a straight, wide line through the untamed grasses, the black sand pathway is lightened by bright white shells to the northwest and north, but darkens as it angles towards the sound of crashing waves.  Raked sand, disrupted on its northwestern edge by invading waves, surrounds a square bungalow built on sturdy foundation stones.  A heavy breeze, carrying with it the dampness of the ocean, passes through the area.",
      "The black sand pathway cuts a straight, wide line through rows of decorated rocks and sea glass.  The road, highlighted by bright white shells, leads to the northwest and north areas of the village.  Makeshift lodgings, hung with lattices of dried seaweed and reinforced by sturdy foundation stones, dot the grassy field, the homes embellished with symbols and effigies carved from driftwood.  A heavy breeze passes through the area, carrying with it the salty brine of the ocean."
