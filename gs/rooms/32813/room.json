    "description": [
      "A private dock edges a small houseboat, which is securely moored to large pilings sunk deeply into the floor of the bay.  Seagulls wheel and call raucously overhead, and one large fellow stands domineeringly on top of one of the pilings, obviously quite used to interlopers of the non-winged sort.  Nets and cane poles lean against the side of the houseboat, providing a maritime motif."
