      "Traversing the ceiling with their vibrant hues, spiderweb veins of minerals and gemstones wend their way through the stone.  Flickering lights, as if torches burned within the crystalline structures, dance beneath the surface and suffuse the room with a prismatic light that is consistent and sufficient to brightly illuminate the area.  Forming natural frames, fluorite columns poke their translucent heads out of the walls in a pattern of green, purple, and pink around painted images."
