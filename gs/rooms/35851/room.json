      "The walls of this room are unfinished, some parts revealing the stonework beneath what is the begining of artfully applied plaster.  Wood sections of the frame reveal some of the exterior wall.  The work is scattered and unfocused around a large dark steel toolbox, each part of the room in various stages of completion."
