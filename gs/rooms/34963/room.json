      "Diaphanous curtains of tulle are draped across the rope-bound framework of the pergola, the airy fabric pooling along the creeping thyme covering the ground.  Hand-woven garlands of blue-violet wisteria decorate the repurposed wooden benches facing the central pavilion, the florals tucked with tiny notes written with childlike calligraphy.  Clusters of clay-potted foliage encircle the periphery of the pergola guarded by a lacquered piece of origami, the tiny toads nestled in beds of tumbled pebbles."
