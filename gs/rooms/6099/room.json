      "A huge, uneven mound of earth rises in the center of the weed-choked field just southwest of here, as tall as a three-story building.  The mound is too crude by far to have been built by the elves, its reddish-brown spires of dried mud rough and half-crumbled by the ravages of the weather, and skittering dark forms the size of large cats seem to be moving across its tortuous surface.",
