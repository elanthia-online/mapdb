      "Messy pink handprints wrap around the walls, a series of smudges and dripping paint also adding decoration.  The floor is covered with a large white piece of canvas material which is littered with empty paint cans and splatters.   A lone broken chair occupies the center of the room, its seat offering a home to a few refreshments.  The pink oak door sits propped against the frame, removed from the hinges allowing open access into the space."
