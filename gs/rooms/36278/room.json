      "Vibrant green grass grows within a meadow spotted with goldenrod, larkspur, and the occasional black-eyed daisy, while towering modwirs form a natural boundary to the wild growth.  Lined with smooth river stones, a narrow dirt track ambles between the edge of the path and a two-story stable with wide haon and birch doors.  A cheerily burning lantern hangs from the widow's peak, its light illuminating the stained glass window beneath it."
