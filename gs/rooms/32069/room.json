      "Aswirl with blooms tinted dusky violet in the muted lighting of twilight, flowering jacaranda trees spread their contorted limbs over the petal-strewn path.  Royal purple plants provide intensely colored, shimmery foliage traced with viridescent veins and rachis.  Stalks of larkspur pepper the vegetation, their blossoms opened in bold displays of rich plum hues."
