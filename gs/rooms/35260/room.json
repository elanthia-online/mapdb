      "Weathered wooden planks extend outward from the dock, upheld by white travertine columns etched with deep fluting.  A weathered nautical flag flutters gently from a tall mast lashed to the pier's edge, its colors muted by salt and sun.  Light filters through the clear, aquamarine water, casting shimmering patterns on the sandy bottom below."
