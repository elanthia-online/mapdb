      "Several half-bust displays stand tall on the counters flanking the walkway deeper into the shop, their shorn necks adorned with a variety of metals and gems of remarkably quality.  Over one counter is a row of yew pegs and a line of filigreed hooks over the other, while a silver-framed round mesh display sits on a pedestal atop the second marble top.  A gold-framed vellum sign stands stoically at the end of one counter."
