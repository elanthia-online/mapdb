      "Ornamental grasses sway in the breeze, their long shoots sheltering the meandering pathways of the garden.  Stepping stones cross a small, shallow pond, where lily pads float on the surface and silvery fish slip through the turquoise waters.  A wooden arbor marks the entrance to a secluded nook with a carved stone bench, and an open gate leads to the avenue beyond."
