    "description": [
      "Multiple paths veer off through the pebbled dunes where clumps of beach grasses cling to sparse soil, holding their own against the wind and salt spray.  Upturned coconut crab shell torches rest atop bamboo poles at several junctures, ready to light the way come nightfall for any venturing to or from the water's edge.  The bustle of dockworkers and merchants from the many piers in the distance brings the only relief from the incessant whistle of ocean winds."
