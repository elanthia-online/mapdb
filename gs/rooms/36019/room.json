      "Moving sinuously from north to south, the wide village track cuts through low fescue as it passes a small hillock crowned with a fire.  Along its eastern flank, an enormous ger banded with orange geometric patterns sits against the backdrop of a paddock wrapped in a birch-sapling fence.  Multiple chimney pipes pierce the conical roof, each sending a thin curl of steam upward into the open sky."
