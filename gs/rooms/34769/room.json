      "Driven by torchlight from the southeast, shadows race over the huge back of a black stone spider statue rearing back to strike.  They linger on a huge red crystal hourglass breaching the smooth plane of the stone creature's back.  The statue's shadow looms over the sullen glow of rubies inlaid into a dais of black ora."
