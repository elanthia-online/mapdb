      "A cluster of young larch trees huddles just off the road to the east.  Their needles have turned a brilliant yellow, and many of the needles have dropped, covering the ground in a crunchy, golden carpet.  The trees look very much out of place, surrounded by the deep green foliage of the evergreen pines and cedars.",
