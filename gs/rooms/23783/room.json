      "Shackles and chains hang from the walls, with soiled mounds of straw heaped into the corners.  The air hangs thick with the scent of mildew and rot, with only a few lanterns hanging from the walls providing very dim lighting amid the stalls.  Some of the areas are sectioned off creating individual cells, presumably for the more dangerous denizens kept here."
