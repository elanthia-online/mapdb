      "On a lazy rise at the northwestern edge of the estate, a steel-framed glass greenhouse stands amid the rows of snow-dusted fruit trees.  Outside stands a wheelbarrow full of fresh soil and several sacks of compost.  The orchard proceeds almost up to the wall of the state, over which the slate-tiled roof of Clovertooth Hall can be seen."
