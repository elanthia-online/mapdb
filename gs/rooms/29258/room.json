      "Piercing the eastern wall, a large beach boulder has forced a narrowing of the corridor but provides an excellent anchor for a bevy of off-white tallow candles whose flaming wicks dance before an invading mist.  Ribbons of paint, sluiced from their footholds during their sojourn in a watery grave, lay in blue and copper bundles upon the ground."
