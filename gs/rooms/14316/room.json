      "Barely wide enough for one person, the busy hallway runs from the kitchen out to the tavern and eatery.  Oil lamps glow dimly and do little to dispel the shadows.  Somewhat disorienting is the fact that the swinging door at the far end doesn't sit square in the jamb, giving the illusion that the building is slightly tilted."
