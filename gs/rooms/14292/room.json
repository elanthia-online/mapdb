      "Tenacious overgrowth has all but obscured a rusted iron fence and the small park confined within.  Moldy wooden planks lie strewn about vegetation tall enough to hide the predatory lowlifes that claim this territory.  The narrow, muddy path winds its way eastward, interrupted only by the decaying body of a fallen modwir tree."
