      "Near the heart of the disc, an unsightly chasm delves into its blue stone.  The edges are black and look to have run like wax before hardening back into porous stone.  In some places, the walls of the gouge are nearly as smooth as glass, while other spans bulge with warped, blistered stone that bleeds green-tinged radiance.  Fragments of rock litter the belly of the chasm in every shade of blue from turquoise to richest indigo."
