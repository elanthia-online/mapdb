      "An archway from the main chamber opens into this side passage, fitted out as a small shop.  Sealed boxes are stacked along the walls and fitted into natural ledges along the sandstone rock face, barely allowing passage around a large oak table that dominates the center of the room.  A pitted steel shelf is fastened along one wall, its rusting surface bending perceptibly under the weight of the various jars stored there."
