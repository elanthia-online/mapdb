      "Cold wind moans down the lonesome street, feeling as if it is blowing right off of the glacier itself.  The chill in the air and the tightly shuttered windows of the houses make the stretch of road an unwelcoming one.  A whiff of strange incense, woodsy and bitter, lingers on the wind, though its source is unclear.",
