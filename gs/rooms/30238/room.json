      "Alternating glaes-banded planks stretch from one end of the catwalk to the other.  An oak and glaes shop and a saltstained teak building rest on stilts above the ocean water below, and marking the top of a wide ramp, a single sun-bleached flag rests atop a nearby wooden pillar, flapping in the ever-present ocean breeze."
