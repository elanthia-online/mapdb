      "The Pub is a comfortable chamber, open on the west to a view of town and sea, as well as an imposing outlook of the Aerie Auditorium floating at a similar altitude.  A number of tables offer seating, each with distinctive design echoing that of the Aerie and its supporting column.  Across the south wall of the Pub is a long bar, crafted of polished teak and rolaren hardware shined to a high gloss."
