      "Nebulous mist collects along the ceiling, pooling in shifting layers that diffuse a faint glow across the chamber.  At the center rests a solitary sarcophagus, its outline blurred by the wavering haze above.  Wall niches gape along the sides, their hollow depths steeped in shadow.  Against one wall stands an aged wooden bench, its seat holding a shallow bowl where curls of half-burned paper linger like forgotten prayers."
