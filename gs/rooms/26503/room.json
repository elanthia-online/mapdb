      "Brisk winds coil around the basalt outcropping like a serpent around its prey, threatening to deplete the available air in an instant.  Thick fog sodden with sea spray veils the view, though the sound of immense waves crashing against the rocks below is good indication to hang on tightly to the ladder rungs.  Peeking through occasional breaks in the mist-laden cloud is a sloped ledge, though what lies beyond is not visible."
