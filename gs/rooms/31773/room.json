      "Wrapped in a towering ebonwood bookcases, the nook is a somewhat private booth covered in decorative rugs that compliment the floral-patterned walls.  Though no windows are present, lighting is not an issue as wall sconces housing frosted globes are prevalent in this area.  A small sign offers information for the curious."
