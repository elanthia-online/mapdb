      "The smell of steeping tea hangs like perfume in the air, herbal and floral notes lingering in a heavy pall over the front room of the shop.  A wide wenge counter with inlaid purpleheart blossoms stands near to the entrance, forming a rounded rectangle around a tall shelf laden with porcelain jars of tea leaves.  Drifting curtains of black silk patterned with deep violet blooms hang over an archway heading eastward into the tea room."
