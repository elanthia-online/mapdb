    "description": [
      "Small but high-walled, the greenhouse is crafted of rainbow-whorled glass panels and a packed dirt floor.  Three-tiered shelving units support various planters and are arranged against the glass walls, each housing nozzled gnomic devices that hum and buzz at various intervals.  A central mahogany workstation with a recessed metallic bin of dirt rests in the center of the space amid tidily stacked potting supplies.  Anchored to the glass near the door is a piece of artwork crafted of silks that honors the lifecycle of hellebore."
