      "Flakes of ash cling to the ground and waver in the sere winds roiling up from the volcanic flats below the plateau.  They dust wagons and stalls resting in the shadow of the city's basalt walls, which stretch imposingly toward the smoky skies.  Age-darkened whalebone inlay set into the walls depicts nautical scenes and no small amount of bloodshed."
