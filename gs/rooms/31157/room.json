      "Warm steam tumbles down the gently inclined slope, the starlight dancing off the moisture particles in its composition to lend the air a silvery hue.  Cultivated and carefully pruned, dark green leaves dominate the deciduous shrubs that grow between the various pathways that slip through the area.  Bright red chokeberries cling to the underside of the sprawling bush."
