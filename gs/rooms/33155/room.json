      "Devoid of nearby furnishings, the western wall is painted to resemble an arctic night sky and is dominated by the image of a golden-eyed polar bear.  Several frosted glaesine globes bath the room in a warm from their anchored position in the ceiling.  Plush snow white carpeting dappled with golden threads lends the otherwise austere space a coziness that is enhanced by the presence of a golden crushed velvet settee.  A lacquered white door leads to the hallway, while a gold-edged niveous silk curtain provides access to the storage facilities."
