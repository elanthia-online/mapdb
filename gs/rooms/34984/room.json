      "Water, cruel and cold, laps at the black sand, leaving behind foam as white as the snowbanks further up the shore.  Briny air whips across the beach in knife-edged gusts, stirring the fronds of kelp that dots the sands in thick, dark clumps.  The distant cries of a seabird cut through the thunderous rumble of the surf."
