      "Damaged hammers with split handles and discarded shafts are carelessly tossed into a small clearing.  Strung up between two pine trees, a rope hammock provides a place to relax.  Numerous hammers are evident not too far away in the ruins of a pumpkin patch.  Frost covers the smashed pulp.  Written in block letters, a large warning sign is posted on nearby poles."
