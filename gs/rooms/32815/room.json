    "description": [
      "Several crimson-draped tables are scattered across the wooden floor, surrounded by velvet-cushioned chairs perched upon wyvern-carved legs.  A gilded chandelier of gently curved dragonstalks curls across the pole-centered ceiling radiating bolts of silk, its crystalline leaves casting glinting motes of light over the area as the fixture sways in the ambient breeze.  Lattices of vine-worked greenery frame part of the open-air patio, decorated with hand-drawn sketchings of the fortress."
