      "A colorful woven rug provides a lone spot of color amidst the grey, even walls of the dorter.  High, louvered windows let in a bit of pallid daylight, but otherwise, the light of torches is only sufficient to keep the hall in dim twilight.  The odor of beeswax wafts strongly from a plain spruce door in the western wall.",
