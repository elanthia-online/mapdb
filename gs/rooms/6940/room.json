      "The rivulets of blood trickling down the legs of a crude operating table give some indication of the unpleasantness of this procedure.  Thick glass jars are stacked three deep, each one packed full of preserved eyes with their optic nerves still attached.  A very sharp-looking scalpel has been left at the foot of the table, ready for further use."
