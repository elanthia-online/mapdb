      "Brocade rugs in shades of ebon, grey, and plum are centered on the floor covering the hard ground and giving a soft cushion for walking.  Stands and racks holding a wide variety of items are arranged against one wall.  Hanging from dark bronze chains are a trio of crystal lanterns that are positioned over a small ebonwood table."
