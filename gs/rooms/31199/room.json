      "Plain and austere, the small tent is tidy, unassuming, and well spaced out beneath fragrant sandalwood posts that support an off-white canvas exterior.  Shielded lanterns provide ample illumination while also keeping the flames sheltered from accidental flare ups without diminishing or overwhelming the space with unwanted heat.  Carefully unpacked crates display the tents that are for sale, small images of their painted exteriors adorning the sides of their containers."
