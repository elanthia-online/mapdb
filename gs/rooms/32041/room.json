      "Narrow and meandering, a stream slips through the profusely floriated landscape, its surface obscured by a faintly glowing haze.  Tangled flowering ivy clings to a deteriorating bridge arched over the water, burrowing deep into the cracks of the worn stone.  Strangled by errant vines, verdigris lanterns adorn the crumbling end posts, lightless and long forgotten by time."
