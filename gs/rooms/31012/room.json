      "Separated by a silk screen offering a modicum of privacy, a pair of rosewood vanity tables sit along the northern wall.  Plush, velvet-cushioned benches are arranged in front of each table facing a row of beveled glass mirrors, their reflection capturing a series of display cases on the opposite wall.  A shop attendant mills about, offering facecloths and color advice to patrons."
