    "description": [
      "The glacier floor ends at a huge cavern of glittering ice directly southwest.  The mountains pinch in tightly, suspending the ice in between them.  Strange rumblings followed by the sounds of explosions emanate from the south, shaking the ground slightly and making it difficult to stand.  The smaller animals seem to have abandoned this area entirely, although the sawgrass appears to flourish nearer to the ice cavern.  To the east the glacier widens out again in this canyon."
