      "More of a workroom than a sales parlor, the room smells faintly of acrid catalysts and burning sulphur.  The likely source of the odor is a series of spiraled tubes, beakers, and vials full of strange bubbling liquids that sits behind the narrow teak sales counter.  Several bottles holding quicksilver, oil of antimony, and spirit of hartshorn gleam from a shelf that would require a ladder to reach, their identities obvious from neat labels beneath each."
