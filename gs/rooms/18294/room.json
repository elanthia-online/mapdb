      "Reaching over the tufted grass clearing, an enormous banyan tree looms over a sleepy tortoise.  Centered in the surrounding vegetation, the banyan tree's roots bow outwards creating a barely noticeable dark hollow.  Reflecting the muted moonlight, bleached bones stand out against the darkened shadows in the clearing.  Highlighted by a stray moonbeam, a single fiery red lily rises up from the pile of bones.",
      "Reaching over the tufted grass clearing, an enormous banyan tree offers a shady respite for a sleepy tortoise.  Centered in the surrounding vegetation, the banyan tree's roots bow outward creating a small, dark hollow.  Reflecting the bright sunlight, bleached bones stand out against the verdant grass and beige topsoil.  Adding a small splash of color, a single fiery red lily rises up from the pile of bones."
