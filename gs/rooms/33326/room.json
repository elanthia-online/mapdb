      "Golden oak shelves line the walls and are stocked with clear jars displaying a variety of dried fruits and spices, while bundles of herbs dangle from twine strung in a zigzag pattern between the support beams overhead.  Off to one side sits an overstuffed golden velvet couch, and a glass-shelved bronze cart is stationed at the far end."
