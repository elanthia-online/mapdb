      "A small pathetic looking pine tree stands in the corner of one yard, struggling to survive despite the severe windburn and the evergreen bushes crowding it on two sides.  Once pristine white snow gathered on the branches is now almost black from the dirt, smoke, and grime blown around on swirling winds.  The fine soil in which the tree was planted has since degraded to an icy sludge from the traffic passing near it and the animals digging around its base."
