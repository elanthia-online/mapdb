      "Set back from the festivities, a tall, sloping arch has been constructed of wood wrapped in willow vines and adorned with ribbon streamers and a variety of brightly hued flowers.  From the center of the arch, a swing hangs down on thick lengths of heavy rope, and the ground beneath it is bare of grass, scuffed by the many feet of people who have swung upon it."
