      "Mistwood racks hug the northern and eastern walls of this capacious square tent, their crossbars burdened with garments for sale.  At their junction, a multitiered mistwood jewelry coffret stands open, its clinquant offerings spilling from tier to tier.  The corner opposite them provides a small seating area, the cozy nook partitioned from the rest of the shop by a plushly cushioned L-shaped wooden bench."
