      "Green-stained iron poles along the perimeter tether a variety of silk kites, each one embroidered with the image of a colorful stag rising high into the air.  The benches have been painted in a similarly vivid palette, the swirls of paint depicting a lion and stag locked in combat, each creature inset with eyes of polished stone.  The continuous barrage of color collides with the additional din of the market and joust, creating an almost overwhelming atmosphere."
