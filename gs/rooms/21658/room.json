      "Large rock-lined ovens cover the western wall, their heat emanating into the room and making it slightly uncomfortable.  Nearby stands a small stack of wood, ready to stoke the fires within the ovens.  A long counter stands empty of food, a wide variety of knives and other kitchen utensils stowed in baskets and blocks along its back.  Hanging over the counter is a large copper pot rack."
