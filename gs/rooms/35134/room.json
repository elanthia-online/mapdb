      "Huge statues of proud krolvin in rugged attire flank the wide street as it rises toward the palace, abetted in its climb by a series of great hewn stone steps.  The statues cast diffuse shadows in the icy moonlight.  No two are the same.  One depicts a slender robed figure holding a gnarled staff aloft, while another, a muscular male in the coat and cap of a sea captain, raises an orb aloft in his sinewy hands.  Cobalt blue banners snap like thunder in the wind."
