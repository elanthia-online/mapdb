      "Bookshelves, rising high overhead, are filled with tomes in all sizes and colors of leather bindings.  Moonlight streaming through tall, narrow windows casts thin bands of silvery light on a carved modwir desk and its matching chair.  Nestled among the stacks is an immense hearth wrought of rough local stone, and stretching between a winding staircase and an ironwood door is a modwir credenza.",
