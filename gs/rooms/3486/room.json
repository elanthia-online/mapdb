Blocking the center of the wey is the sooty, shattered rubble of a great statue, its form so ravaged that it is impossible to tell what it might have been.",
      "Numerous city dwellers wander to and from the northern section of the court, where Wyvern Keep sits up against the edge of the cobblestoned wey and stands tall above all nearby buildings.  A statue of Vaalorian soldiers stands sentinel in the center of the wey, with a number of guards standing around it, each diligently eyeing the crowd."
