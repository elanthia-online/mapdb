      "Sculptural holly bushes and fir trees line the side of the narrow road, their ribbon-wrapped pots startlingly bright against the ground of packed dirt and snow.  Overcrowded buildings swallow up the open air to the south and west, their slanted roofs nearly blotting out the sky.  From somewhere nearby, the scent of freshly cut wood is at odds with that of stale ale.",
      "Clumps of excavated grass lie in browning piles upon the side of the narrow road, their white roots startlingly bright against the ground of packed dirt and grey pebbles.  Overcrowded buildings swallow up the open air to the south and west, their slanted roofs nearly blotting out the sky.  From somewhere nearby, the scent of freshly cut wood is at odds with that of stale ale."
