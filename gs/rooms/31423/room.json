      "Aside from a single, flickering grey orb floating near the center of the convex dirt ceiling, this room is completely dark.  Smells of overturned earth and the putrid stench of death attack your senses within this cramped space, while a thick, pitch black fog billows and roils about unpredictably, at times completely obscuring the merchandise for sale.  A tight dirt passageway is scarcely visible, barely arching out of the packed dirt ground."
