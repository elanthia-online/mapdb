    "description": [
      "Coral, pulverized into colorful dust by the inexorable power of the waves, stains the sand with the dazzling hues of the setting sun.  Shells, from ridged cockles to horned murexes, litter the rosy sand in abundance, pearlescent nacre on overturned ones shimmering with pastel rainbows.  A solitary hump of volcanic rock stands like a lone sentinel near the waterline.  Worn nearly smooth by the elements, it watches the swells and crashes of the blue waters beyond its domain."
