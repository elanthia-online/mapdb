      "A crooked path weaves through the maze of boxwood nooks, bringing you to the curved wall of stone, familiar for its fortress-like enclosure.  Dangling from a series of pulleys above, a thick rope hauls a large passenger basket up to a rocky ledge.  Several flickering, wall-braced invar sconces run the length of the apparatus, lighting the way."
