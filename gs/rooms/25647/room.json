      "Glass icicles hang from branches of miniature evergreen trees growing in planter boxes on each side of a wall-to-wall glass window,  the effect creating a framed portrait of an artist-rendered view of the Manor grounds beyond.  Stretched out in front of a stone fireplace, a snowy white fur rug brushes against the tapered legs of a pair of overstuffed white leather chairs, each draped with a snowflake-patterned quilt.  A heavy slate blackboard hangs above a polished spruce-carved writing desk next to a curtained opening."
