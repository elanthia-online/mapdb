      "Light silken drapes are held overhead with silken cords and flutter in the evening breezes in this quiet outdoor space.  Open on three sides, the veranda provides a comfortable spot from which to enjoy the moonlit lushness of the surrounding hillsides.  A raised teakwood dance floor is tucked to one side, and low tables and rattan settees provide relaxing spots for outdoor dining."
