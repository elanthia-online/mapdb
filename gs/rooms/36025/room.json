      "Boardwalk planks stretch along the shoreline, their path paralleling the mist-hazed waters where small fishing vessels bob in slow, steady motions.  Wind chimes sway from the crossbeam of a freestanding arch fashioned of braided larch and birch poles, their pale surfaces catching the shifting light as the wood beneath them creaks in the breeze.  A line of alternating larch and birch steps climbs the hillock to the south, a bonfire's glow visible above."
