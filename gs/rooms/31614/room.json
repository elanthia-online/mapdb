      "Like a tangled web, strips of dry land snake around water-filled depressions and connect with other sections only to deliver the traveler to a dead-end.  Tall clumps of cordgrass shroud the pathway as it meanders in opposite directions from the parched riverbed, but an occasional breeze forces the grass to yield and exposes the ground enough that travelers can safely navigate through the neighborhood."
