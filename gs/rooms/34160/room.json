      "The tail end of an immense vermiform corpse hangs over a short ledge leading to a tunnelway above.  Rancid sweetness fills the air, rising from the creature's vitrifying flesh and dissolving organs.  Life has sprung up in the wake of death, taking the form of countless mushrooms thriving on the lifeless body.  Most of the fungi are pale, but a few are imbued with splashes of color, from electric blues to pearlescent greens."
