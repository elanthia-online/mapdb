      "The darkened tunnel opens up into an enormous cavern, the malformed limestone columns casting ominous shadows as their forms flicker against the iron-mounted torches scattered along the area.  Mirror-like pools conceal the true size of the area, flanking an uneven path that curves further down into the depths of the cavern."
