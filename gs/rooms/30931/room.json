      "A soft breeze flutters the scalloped edges of the green umbrella shielding the table from debris falling from the lively canopy overhead.  Birds and monkeys play among the boughs surrounding the patio, and clouds of butterflies languidly drift by.  The view of the surrounding jungle tier is expansive, revealing a world inhabited by denizens who rarely, if ever, touch the jungle floor."
