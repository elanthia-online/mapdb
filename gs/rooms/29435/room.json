      "The bustling noises of the more populated areas in the strip quiet somewhat at the dead end of the market path.  A crackling bonfire of cedar and birch logs is highlighted at the center of the vicinity, encircled by citrine-caged globes that burn brightly from above with amber-hued flame.  Abundant piles of cavern rock and gravely debris are pushed back against the sides of a massive boulder that still stands in front of a jagged hillside."
