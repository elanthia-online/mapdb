      "A crushed skeleton pokes out from below a fallen pillar.  The ornate moldings that once adorned the elaborate ceilings lie scattered around the area, imbedded in grooves and cracks in the floor.  A few twigs stand out in the ruin, set atop a still standing arch where birds have made a nest."
