      "The use of green in this room is astounding to the point of being appalling.  A massive sea turtle is painted in vivid color and detail across the arcing ceiling.  A sea green-paned oil lamp suspended overhead casts an uneasy, dim light that resembles the rippling waves of the sea.  Dark verdant leather covers the long benches, bits of stuffing showing here and there from several tears."
