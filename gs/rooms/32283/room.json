      "Dim light filters in through the open shutters of a large glass window flanked by a pair of unlit sconces to illuminate the room in a dull, gray glow.  A large wool rug is laid out in the center of the room with a pair of over-stuffed couches set on it.  Next to the couches, a large river rock fireplace serves as the central focus of the room with a wood bin dutifully placed beside it.  Almost as an afterthought, a glass display case and a dark mahogany table have been placed against opposite walls with their wares illuminated in an amber light by a pair of candelabras.",
