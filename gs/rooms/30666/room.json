      "Given the lack of light in this kitchen, the quality of the food prepared here is somewhat suspect.  A stone counter runs the full length of one wall, with a sink cut into it at one end.  The floor is wet, though whether that is from recent washing or permanent dankness, it is impossible to tell."
