      "The trail, if there even is one, crosses the valley floor between the western and eastern mountain slopes.  The valley floor is flat and, for the most part, lifeless.  Long striations crisscross the tundra.  These are not deep or very wide, and snow has filled many of them in.  It is indiscernible as to whether these have a seismological origin or are the result of the constant passage of large animals, a passage that has perhaps followed the same path for centuries."
