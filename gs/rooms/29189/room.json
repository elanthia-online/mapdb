    "description": [
      "The crunch of gravel, stones, and coarse sand underfoot can barely be detected above the howling of the winds across the beachscape.  Broken and discarded crab shells proclaim the success of the hunters who came before you, and freshly dug holes mark the burrows of rodents who escaped the fate that awaits most prey.  Small black terns and other seabirds hover, swoop, and dive above the shallows blanketing a half-exposed sandbar off the eastern shoreline."
