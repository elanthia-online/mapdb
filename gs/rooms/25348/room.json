    "description": [
      "Cramped and close, as though added onto the building as an afterthought, this nook has very little room to move in.  Sitting in the direct center of the space is a hard wooden stool, the floor around it littered in various old hair clippings.  A tray of tools has been shoved into one corner, its surface covered in combs, razors, scissors, and other unidentifiable sharp instruments.  There is a barely noticeable whiff of burnt hair permeating the stuffy air."
