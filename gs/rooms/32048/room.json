      "Gossamer webs, strung with shimmering dew beads, stretch between the luminous stalks of lofty, flat-capped mushrooms that look as though they were carved from jade.  Growing in irregular, petal-like clusters, apricot jelly fungi patch the damp soil with their illumed, gelatinous forms.  Foliose lichen encrusts the rocks that force the path to pick a winding way through the area."
