      "Numerous trees and leafy plants fill the enclosure to the south, forming a thriving jungle surrounded by walls of stone.  A small waterfall cascades down the back wall and flows into a stream that heads towards the south wall of the habitat.  Brief glimpses of movement disturb the foliage, and a silver-backed black gorilla can be seen through the leaves."
