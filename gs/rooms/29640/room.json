      "Conically peaked and crafted of umber canvas, the sprawling pavilion walls have heavy weights sewn into their lowest hem to prevent the wind from invading the space.  Lofted braziers are suspended between a pair of central posts, each filled with brightly burning coals that both illuminate and warm everything beneath them.  Tables and baskets are arranged away from the single entry, their wares easily visible in the flickering light."
