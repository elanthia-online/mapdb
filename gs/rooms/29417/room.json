      "The eastern landscape opens to an exhibition of softly sloping valleys and rolling hillsides, the eburnean snowfall dappled with charcoal and ashen pockets that resemble a falcon's coloring.  Sparking with an occasional pop of red-orange embers, a crackling maplewood bonfire burns with incandescent white hot flames, positioned as a barrier between the grounds and enclosing wilderness."
