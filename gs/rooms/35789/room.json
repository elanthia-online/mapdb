    "description": [
      "The pier juts out from the shoreline into foamy waters, its thick beams aged from years of salt spray.  A teak-framed tavern with a slanted roof of slate tiles stands atop sturdy beams driven deep into the seabed.  Smoke curls from the chimney of a bustling workshop, carrying the scent of burning wood and forge fire.  Iron rings are embedded into the edge of the pier, anchoring thick ropes that stretch toward a two-masted brigantine.  Bridging the gap between ship and shore, a gangplank rests, its boards worn smooth by countless boots."
