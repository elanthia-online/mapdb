    "description": [
      "Dimly lit by flickering ship's lanterns that are more corrosion than metal, the hut's walls are a mishmash of branches from various trees, bound tightly with lengths of dried sinew.  Clusters of herbs bound by catgut dangle from the ceiling, swaying counter to bone talismans amidst the pungent, resinous smoke puffing from the lamps.  Crude clay pots filled with murky liquids and strange powders clutter makeshift shelves that are littered with bones fragments old and new."
