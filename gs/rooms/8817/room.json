      "From the southwest, the clatter of dice, the clicking of ivory, and the shuffling of cards is heard.  Looking around the reception area, you see a faded sofa upon which sits a young couple, passing the time in pleasant self-involvement.  To the north is a black door guarded by a shifty-looking dwarf."
