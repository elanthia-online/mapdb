      "The two outside corner walls of this room are glass doors granting access to a small, private garden.  Moonlight gives the red oak flooring a blue shading.  Chimes of all sorts drop down from the ceiling, their music casting a hypnotic sensation on every breeze.  A large red oak tub, built into the floor, is filled to brimming with steamy water.  Fluffy, absorbent towels are stored in a rack within easy reach."
