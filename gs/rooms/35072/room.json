      "Several small sharks and squid are draped across raised beds of ice outside a fishmonger's shop near the end of the row.  Given the nauseating melange of tanning solutions and slaughter drifting from the eastern verges of the thoroughfare, the briny crispness of fresh fish is like a nosegay for the beleaguered nose.  A preserved kraken tentacle is mounted above the shop's double doors."
