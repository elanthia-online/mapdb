      "Clothier stalls with bright green and yellow awnings dominate this section of the market, each complete with loud hawkers proclaiming their wares as the best.  Nestled amongst the louder offerings, a modest slate blue tent framed by placard-covered oak posts stands open for business, its interior dark and cool in the bright sunlight.  A small welcome mat sits at its entry, the sun-bleached rushes a stark contrast to the painted cobblestones beneath."
