      "The angled surface of the ledge is worn smooth from countless years of scouring rain, though its seaward-facing edge is sharp and jagged from undercutting waves battering it relentlessly.  Fierce swells continuously crash against a row of basalt rocks near a dark cave leading into the cliffside, forcing seawater violently upward toward the churning maelstrom that roils across the skyline."
