      "The river branches here at the edge of a stone breakwater surrounding the riverfront of this part of town.  As a result, the river is slowed down considerably as it flows around the north and south sides of town.  You also see a watchtower overlooking the road and the eastern half of town, its guards wary of any mischievous travelers."
