    "description": [
      "The rimy stone walls of this chamber are layered with numerous shields, carved and chased with grooves in equally varied patterns.  Frost covers a cracked wooden floor, and icicles precariously jut from an arched stone ceiling as minuscule, glimmering snowflakes constantly form and diffuse in the blink of an eye.  A fog-shrouded gash is all that remains of a door and some steps that lead south and upward."
