      "A jovial woman patiently assists patrons in this freestanding pavilion, hawking wares strewn over makeshift tables and counters.  From the eastern corner of the roped-off displays and arching overhead to the west is a massive, artfully crafted coral and sea glass dolphin of enormous proportions.  The fins of the dolphin extend outward and provide a sheltered area beneath them."
