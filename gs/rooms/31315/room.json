    "description": [
      "A series of spoon-strung ropes and teacups are draped high above a lacquered teak table encircled by colorful velvet chairs, the vibrant glass cups tinting the flora-strewn surfaces in a medley of bright tones.  The latticed walls of the garden are dotted with verdant green topiaries, their concealed branches creating a foundation for thin wooden shelves filled with glass bottles.  A curtain of silk and velvet-petaled roses leads back into the pavilion, the entrance decorated with tiny wire-framed bees."
