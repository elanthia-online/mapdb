      "The brackish water flows past the shoreline so slowly that floating debris makes nearly imperceptible progress.  A swath of flattened reeds and grasses leads from the water's edge to a raised berm of debris.  Remnants of a single broken eggshell are all that mark this as a now abandoned empty nest.",
      "The brackish water flows past the shoreline so slowly that floating debris makes nearly imperceptible progress.  A swath of flattened reeds and grasses leads from the water's edge to a raised berm of debris.  Nestled just to the side of the detritus, a weathered plank footbridge leads over a narrow span of water.  Remnants of a single broken eggshell are all that mark this as a now abandoned empty nest."
