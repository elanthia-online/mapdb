      "The narrow stairwell fills the cylindrical body of the tower's spire.  The spiraling passage is so narrow that in order for two to pass, one must crouch into a window alcove.  Cold drafts of air stream through dark turret windows.  Wooden torches are hung from the exterior walls.  At the base of the stairwell is a mithril-banded ebonwood door."
