      "Curtains of straggly spiderwebbing flutter in an unseen wind as air moves through the room, drawn down the chimney by the fire recessed in a brick-lined alcove.  Forgotten sconces line the walls which are covered in peeling greyish paper, their tallows long since lost to the ravages of time.  Skittering sounds occasionally punctuate the crackling grumble of the fire."
