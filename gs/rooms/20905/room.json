      "Clusters of bright fungus dot the soft ground surrounding an enormous banyan.  The huge lattice-work trunk creates numerous hollows and nooks.  Sparse clumps of vegetation creep about the base of the tree in a feeble attempt to thrive.  To the north, a group of lichen covered boulders rise from the earth in a pyramid-like shape.",
