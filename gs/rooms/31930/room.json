      "Hand-crafted forms of vivid paper and parchment hang from mahogany beams above, both festooned man and mammal suspended by hooks of spiraled metal.  An arboreal display of stained glass branches stands in the center of the shop, the splayed ends decorated with silken leaves dyed metallic jade and emerald.  Nestled in the back corner of the room is a carved driftwood octopus, its arms raised upwards at the ceiling, each curled around a colorful wooden stick.",
