      "White shutters frame an enormous window in the eastern wall, which is covered in stucco and painted a deep emerald green.  Complementing the warm glow of the teak floors, a long counter fashioned of linden stretches across the center of the room, creating a physical barrier that separates the shelves filled with wares from the walking space.  Baskets arranged along the opposite wall are filled with threads, measuring tapes, thimbles, and other cobbling necessities."
