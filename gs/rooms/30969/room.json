      "Edges fluttering in the soft, sea-born breeze, a bright white pavilion built upon the travertine cobblestones has its sides pinned down against the cool night air.  Large terracotta planters housing shrubs offer points of interest amid the guard railings that overlook the ocean far below, while clinging cushion moss creeps at the courtyard's edges.  Distant, yet insistent, the rhythmic sound of the tide brushing the shore rolls through the area."
