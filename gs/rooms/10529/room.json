      "Standing under the starry sky is a lone stone bier that is splattered with brownish stains.  A shallow ditch contains the remains of several unrecognizable and disarranged corpses.  Covering a good portion of the carcasses is a thick, greenish, bubbling liquid.  A rancid stench rides on the vapors, saturating the night air with utter foulness.",
