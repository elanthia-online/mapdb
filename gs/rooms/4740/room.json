      "An ancient black oak, bearing a hide of wrinkled grey bark, squats amidst the scattered cobblestones which once formed a path through these woods.  Clasped within its sprawling, exposed roots is a shield-sized wooden object, its surface nearly covered in a mass of damp fungus.  Something moves in the leafy branches overhead, its form masked in shadow.",
