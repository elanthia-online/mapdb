      "Cool, damp air fills this vaulted, brick-lined space.  A single sputtering torch casts long, dancing shadows that swallow rows of sturdy stone columns.  The scent of earth and dust hangs heavy in the air, disturbed only by the echo of occasional footsteps on the worn flagstones.  A long stone table rests silently in one of the darkened corners."
