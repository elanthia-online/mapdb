      "Candlelight from a large overhead chandelier illuminates this cozy space. Quiet chatting and laughter mix with the smell of roasting rolton coming from a nearby doorway.  A carved bar commands the center of the room with its graceful, serpentine shape.  The entire west wall has been given over to a colorful fresco."
