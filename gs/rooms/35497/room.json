      "A faenor-forged brazier dominates the center of the shop, obscuring the eastern room in sparks of burning resaeun wood scenting the interior.  Ceiling-high racks are angled before the wylten-paneled walls, showcasing a variety of wares neatly displayed on narrow shelves.  Miniature replicas of wood-planked ships are set at the back of the room, the tall-masted sails partially obscuring a ceramic unicorn."
