    ],
    "description": [
      "The hall ends within an octagonal alcove, each of its squared wall panels offering a painted mural.  The murals depict eight varieties of trees, and a gracefully curved scroll painted at the foot identifies the kind.  A round window peeks from among the boughs of the western tree, offering a view of the sparkling river coursing along the perimeter of Willow Hall's grounds.  Five doors are nestled in the base of tree trunks on the walls, crafted of the same wood as the painted renditions."
