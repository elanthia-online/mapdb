      "At the edge of the rocky cliff, a prismatic portal hovers, and at its center, a hazy silhouette of a colossal tower rises up out of the ground.  Nearby are the remains of a small rock fire pit and an empty guard post.  The gusting wind launches a passing swallow into the swirling gateway, and it quickly dematerializes."
