      "There are garden plots along the walls to either side of the jail entrance, a sturdy steel door etched with a dour-looking mule.  The hardy herbs and flowers growing in the cold soil lend the gloomy structure a glimmer of natural beauty.  The jailhouse path bends around a large boulder that is worn smooth by the elements.  The rock's sheer size suggests that its presence might predate the town around it.",
      "A small, well-tended garden surrounds the entrance to the Icemule Trace Jailhouse, providing it with a sense of simple beauty.  The garden is centered around a large boulder that has rested here since long before Icemule was founded."
