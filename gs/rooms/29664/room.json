      "Draped with umber clothes embroidered with virescent images, a pair of open air enclosures flank the roofed corridor.  Heavily reinforced by pipes, the enclosures are largely circular expanses filled with dirt and hay.  A long, low steel trough is built between the two spaces for the occupants of both enclosures to share."
