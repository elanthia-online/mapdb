      "Tall fortifications flank the dirt-covered walkway, the stone-set castle walls covered in splatters of paint and lengths of hempen rope.  Horses crafted from metal and wood are dispersed across the battlefield, their ribbon-knotted reins draped across pillow-shaped saddles.  The faint thumping of drums echoes against the walls, the off-beat rhythm occasionally broken by loud neighing."
