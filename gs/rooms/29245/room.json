      "One wall of the building is entirely glass, each pane placed into a framework of oxidized copper.  The doorway set into the wall is wide and slightly arched, part of a triad of equally spaced openings hung beneath a giant verdigris medallion.  Beyond the half-moon shaped chamber, a flight of three steps leads into the open expanse of the museum."
