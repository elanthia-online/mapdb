      "Dried herbs, tied in tidy bundles, hang from the rafters and hooks on the walls, their fragrance a mixture of medicinal and floral scents.  Long worktables are covered in the half-finished remains of herbal sachets, woven baskets, and braided rings.  Twilight hues filter through the area as light from the many windows illuminates the space."
