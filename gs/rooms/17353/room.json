      "Broad windows open to the night air face the West Lawn, giving the spacious office an expansive feel despite its low-beamed ceiling.  Paintings of former Guildmasters hang on the wall behind a solidly built pinewood desk and flank a pair of glass-fronted bookshelves near the door.  The three padded leather chairs are, like the desk they surround, utilitarian but beautifully crafted."
