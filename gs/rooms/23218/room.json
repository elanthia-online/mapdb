      "Warm steam from a sapphire blue pool fills the room.  The cold from outside is blotted from memory as the radiant warmth begins to sink into your bones.  About the pool are lush plants, more suited to a tropical environment, that seem to thrive upon the warmth.  Lily pads float on the surface of the bubbling pool.",
      "Slightly raised flooring of blackened cedar drops down to gemstone mosaic tile surrounding a bubbling pool.  Misty steam fills the air, the radiant warmth sinking into your bones.  Some low, rounded cedar ottomans cluster around a small stone-bordered pond, the lush vibrancy of potted sirenflowers offset by the pale water lilies floating on the pond's surface."
