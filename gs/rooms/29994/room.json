      "Grit swirls in the air, tossed by a whistling breeze that howls shrilly through a breach in the red stone wall to the east.  Flaking and ancient, paintings on the walls depict warlike figures in once-bright colors.  The wind is not quite enough to dispel the tang stale mead lingering in the area."
