      "Offering an unobstructed view of the valley below, the precipice is comprised of granite and sandstone in contrasting hues.  Rust-colored lichen scrabbles across the uneven ground, finding purchase for its roots within cracks and crevices.  A lone juniper bush huddles close to a bright green fir shrub, the pair taking root against a gently sloping incline."
