      "Intricate dark-hued stains embellish the inner walls of this hallowed alcove, where ample space encircles the central burial vault, allowing unhibited movement.  Smooth, white ceramic tiles, worn by countless visitors, enclose the deceased, radiating outward along the cardinal points, while the interstices between them are embraced by the native ground's natural covering."
