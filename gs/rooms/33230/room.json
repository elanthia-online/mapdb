      "An old mural adorns the far wall of the close infirmary, lending a splash of color to the dour surroundings.  The floor and walls are made of stone and only a single barred window allows in sunlight in wan beams alive with scarce motes of sparkling dust.  Acrid and herbal, a medicinal smell emanates from a large mirrored cabinet in the northern wall.  Cots line the floor, clean and ready for triage."
