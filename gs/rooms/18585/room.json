      "Resting along the eastern wall, a pair of criss-crossed iron shovels have been affixed to the wall by a thin piece of steel.  A wooden box and crate have been placed in the center of the room; both have been filled with various wares.  A large oil painting illustrates an aerial layout of the Grawood Farmstead."
