      "Sooty brick walls and a hard-packed dirt floor contain this improvised showroom below a domed ceiling.  Smoky haze hangs in the air around a display table with items for sale.  Facing the wall, a crowded workbench piled with unfinished parts stands next to a grinding wheel.  Shelves organize finished pieces awaiting assembly.  Heat and an orange glow emanate from a forge to the south.  At the center of it all, a diminutive figure with spider-like arms conducts multiple operations at once."
