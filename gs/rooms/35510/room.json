      "Most of the space in the room's center is taken up by numerous long tables, each of which is furnished with wooden benches.  A massive grated fireplace runs along the southern wall on one side of the room.  Nearby a small pile of wood sits neatly stacked, ready to be used with several bins lined up alongside each other.  The exterior wall is lined with several enormous, stained-glass windows, which contrasts against the cream-colored walls, while a heavy wooden door rests under a wooden stairway leading upstairs."
