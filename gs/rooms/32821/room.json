      "Affixed to the stone wall beside a smooth blue granite desk are polished brass plaques with a bizarre array of yellow feathers.  The opposite wall features an intricate, built-in cubby system neatly housing documents and papers in order of content and priority.  Dangling from a pole in the corner of the office is a wrought iron bird cage emitting a strong luminescence."
