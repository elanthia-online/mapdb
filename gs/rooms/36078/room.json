      "Great beams of darkened fel rise high averhead toward a vaulted ceiling, the dusky wood contrasting against pale plaster walls, many of which are lined in bookshelves, curios, and a single, inconspicuous door.  Within the lounge's heart, several stuffed leather chairs are arranged in a semi-circle near a wide limestone fireplace, with a low carved linden table resting between them.  Warm sunlight streams in through a wide bay window, illuminating the cozy room while offering a striking view of the valley."
