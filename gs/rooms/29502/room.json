      "Polished teak has been intentionally scuffed to reduce the hazards of the perpetually drenched catwalk.  A dark fel and stone shop sits kitty-corner from a slate and haon building, both on sturdy ironwood supports sunk deep into the waters below, and a wide ramp leads away from the catwalk and docking structure.  A string of several bright blue sea slugs carved of coral wind their way along the teak railing, with a giant pink pearl sea star inlaid prominently in the center of the catwalk."
