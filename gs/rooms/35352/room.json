      "Refurbished tobacco wood furnishings fill the air with an earthy aroma that is sweetened by the delicate citrus and sweet clover notes of the white-hearted dusky rose and green-hearted saffron yellow ranunculus that fill the porcelain vase in one corner of the room.  An enormous bed covered in a thick comforter dominates the cobalt blue-tiled floor, while an ivory porcelain wash basin rests upon a nearby bureau.  Ebon-framed watercolors depicting coastal scenes decorate the stucco walls."
