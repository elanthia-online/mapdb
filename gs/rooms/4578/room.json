      "A jagged spire of granite rises out of the ground in this unexpected flat spot on the top of the peak.  A huge nest constructed of tree branches, whole bushes, and bits and pieces of broken armor takes up most of the available space in this sheltered spot.  What ground you can see is littered with the bones of small and not-so-small animals frozen into the ice."
