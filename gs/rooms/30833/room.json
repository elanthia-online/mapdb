      "Pristine white sand spans the inner and outer rings of the atoll, while a collection of tropical trees rises high overhead, their trunks leaning on one another for support.  Flecks of darker sand glimmer in the pale sand leading to the choppy water of a small inlet.  Randomly placed stepping stones of ivory create an erratic path leading along the atoll's edge.",
