      "The arboreal crush of the hinterlands serenely blends a neutral palette of the deepest viridian with more subtle touches of chestnut, fawn, and umber.  Fierce, inbound gusts of sea air glide over impressive snowbanks that have accumulated around errant stone fragments, their untouched surfaces lightly glinting in a wash of glassy argent motes."
