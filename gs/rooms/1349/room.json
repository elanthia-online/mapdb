      "The sound of birds in flight fills the night sky, as fork-tailed mountain swallows descend into the high rock formations to either hand, dropping into the more protected air above the roadway and darting into nests built high in the folds of the Wings.  The surface of the roadway is almost hidden beneath a layer of white droppings, and a faint chorus of sleepy chirping echoes between the rock walls.",
