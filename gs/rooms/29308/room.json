      "A small section of beach is painted underfoot before matching the ceiling and walls, which begin with bleak hues and open-sky tundra before blending into lush tones of prairie.  From there, earthy tones of clouds and rocky terrain transition to sun rays slicing into woodlands and forest, then terminate into rain-spotted jungle and tree canopy.  Past a large cedar-framed glass exhibit is an arch in the north wall."
