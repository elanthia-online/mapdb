      "Scrub grass and weeds grow between the loose cobbles of the courtyard.  Cracks abound on the tall wall surrounding the area.  The shadow of the ancient tower cascades over the wall and courtyard, providing a cool respite from the glaring sun.  Gaping windows look out over the bay and courtyard from high on the tower wall."
