      "Devoid of windows, the small bar is dimly lit, a swirl of tobacco smoke dancing in its rafters.  Rattan-seated stools surround a long bar fashioned of repurposed tobacco wood, its smooth surface lacquered to a lustrous shine.  Large pieces of stuccowork decorate the grey-hued walls, the bright white composition providing a stark contrast to the wood beneath."
