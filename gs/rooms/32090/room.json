      "Looking like an alchemy lab gone awry, the area is filled with tables cluttered with vials, chemicals, snippets of poisonous plants, and copper bowls.  A few rugs have been thrown about as if an afterthought for decor, and framed specimens of insects and aquatic life hang from the walls.  A fuzzy yellow-striped black velvet curtain leads back to the main room."
