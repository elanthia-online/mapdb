      "A large, tranquil pond stretches out to the west, its waters rippling in a soft breeze.  The tips of marsh grass and cattails rise from the surface of the pond, looking as though each plant had decided to take a quick dip in the cool, refreshing water.  Many deep sets of prints and diggings in the muddy shore mark this spot as a favored watering hole for the nearby fauna."
