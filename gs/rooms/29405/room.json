      "The sides of the covered wagon have been folded down, providing a sturdy shelf on which goods are displayed.  Several crates, barrels, and tubs have been placed near the rear of the wain, and hold a variety of products for sale.  Twin brass braziers flank a series of wooden steps leading to the interior of the schooner, providing both light and heat for patrons."
