      "The western side of the courtyard is empty but for the rotting remains of a ladder extended down from the parapet of the outer wall.  Set near the same wall is a stone hitching post constructed by the laying of a rusting metal bar between two large blocks.  Across the faded red paving stones are scattered pieces of broken white bones, dry leaves, and small twigs."
