      "Stained glass windows, each decorated with wild tropical blooms, seem dark and faded.  Sconces upon the walls house tiny copper-sided lanterns, their faces depicting the cut-out images of fireflies, damselflies, and dragonflies that cast a warm glow upon the plush white carpeting that blankets the room.  Scattered in an informal pattern about the room are soft divans, plump couches, and robust armchairs.  Next to the library's entryway, a carved double-wide archway leads into the hallway beyond.",
