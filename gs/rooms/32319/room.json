    ],
    "description": [
      "A barrow has been cut into the face of a high hill that disturbs the flatlands of the delta.  Heavy stones, some nearly the size of boulders, have been piled in front of the entrance.  Great furrows in the ground lead to the west, hinting at how the stones were moved.  They have been in place long enough to boast a filigree of iseya lichen, the brightly colored flora blanketing the rocks in teal and silver colonies."
