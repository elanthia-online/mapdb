      "Smooth to the touch, the edges of the table and the chairs placed here are comfortably worn.  Even the letters carved into the table top are now shallow, perhaps carved by lovers, long ago.  The outline of an old thrak curls around one set of initials.  The only feature not worn away by time is an eye with a tear at the corner."
