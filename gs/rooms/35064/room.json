      "Windows glazed with a tracery of rime look out upon the busy street, but the duty of lighting the drafty timber post office is given over to torches hanging from the walls in bronze brackets.  They fill the air with the tang of pine pitch and more than a little acrid smoke that has blackened the timbers over a burled modwir desk that sits just slightly askew due to one bent leg.  Occasional high-pitched cries pierce the air, emanating down from the mews up above."
