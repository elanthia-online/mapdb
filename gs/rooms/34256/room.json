      "Rounded tiers of stone that resemble natural deposits of sediment rise from the floor of the cavern toward a pellucid obelisk of gemstone.  Pentagonal at its wide base, its faces warp into a lopsided spiral as they twist together near its spindly peak.  Though dwarfed by the multifaceted crystal at the center of the alien plaza, the monolith casts a long, sharp shadow in the flickering radiance bathing the surroundings."
