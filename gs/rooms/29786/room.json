      "Centered along the back wall is a cushioned maple chair neatly laid out with fresh parchment and a full well of ink.  A polished maple desk accompanies the desk, and hanging above is a portrait of an unnamed male gnome in a purple wizard robe and hat.  Occupying the remaining wall space are floor-to-ceiling bookshelves overflowing with books, tomes, scrolls, and parchments.  Suspended from the ceiling is a polished brass chandelier."
