      "A mild hint of wood varnish lingers in the air, mingled with the aroma of dark ale, spirits, and the twang of cigar smoke.  Centered on the back wall is a carved teak bar, and over it hangs a tremendous circular mirror behind glass shelves illuminated in wan jewel-toned hues.  Suede-cushioned stools sit beneath the edge of the counter, which is topped with clean-shaded lamps at intervals.  A narrow stairway leads up to the mezzanine."
