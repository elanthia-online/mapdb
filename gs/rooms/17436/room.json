      "A tall counter stretches across the center of the room, a latched swinging door being the only route to the area behind it.  The red carpeting is somewhat worn on a path from the counter back to the center of the trading post.  A long table behind the counter has piles of different gems on it, sorted by size, color, and type.  The pass through the mountains is visible out of the window to the east."
