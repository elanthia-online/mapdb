      "Charl's Teeth ascend to full and dizzying height from a water-encased foundation.  One lower pinnacle of the crag appears like a broken bicuspid across the expanse of the series of cliffs.  A pool of water gathers in a deep indent in that pinnacle.  Flocks of sea birds congregate around the pool, plucking colorful fish deposited by the bounty of the ocean into the ready feeding pond."
