      "The backstage area is crowded with scenery flats and miscellaneous props and furnishings.  Overhead, a lattice of catwalks, from which hangs a number of ropes and pulleys, crisscrosses in a dizzy pattern.  Along one wall, beside the fly gallery and the pin rail, an oversized sliding panel leads deeper into the guildhall.  A painted door with a sign on it proclaiming it to be the dressing room nestles in the corner."
