      "An ancient shale boulder, painstakingly shaped by the river that once wound through the region, provides a vantage of the blasted plain.  Far to the north, a foreboding city with crude stone walls sprawls atop a grim plateau.  East of the vestige of habitation, a black mountain scrapes at the sky, streaks of lava illuminating its slopes.  Its peak is a shattered ruin that belches clouds of smoke and ash onto the tortured lands below."
