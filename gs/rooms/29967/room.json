      "Snatching roots stretch like talons from the high, rough-hewn walls bordering the corridor.  Snowmelt forms puddles on the slick stone floor, making the footing treacherous.  The moisture has eaten at iron sconces on the walls, grinding them down to rust and warped metal, and the torches within have long since mouldered past the point of uselessness."
