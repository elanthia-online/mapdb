      "Six cast iron stoves line the far, outer wall of the room, each resting atop a thick ceramic slab and housing a thick stovepipe exiting through the wall.  A long teak work surface extends through the center of the room with a collection of various preparation tools scattered across it.  Various sounds of chopping and stirring fills the air, along with the savory scents of a cooking meal."
