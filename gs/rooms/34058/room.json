      "The gallery comes to an end before a spectacular waterfall fountaining with a roar from a cleft in the northeastern wall.  A polished stone chandelier hangs from hefty chains, its light turning the deluge's spray into a shifting curtain of prismatic particles.  A black stone bench traced with spirals of gold has been erected near the hoarbeam rail to face the flow, providing an excellent vantage to observe nature's might."
