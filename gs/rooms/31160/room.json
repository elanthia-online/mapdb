      "Starlight filters through the heavy mist that permeates this section of the mountainside garden.  Ancient and decaying, a lone ironwood rests upon the western edge of the area, its surface riddled with dryad's saddle mushrooms.  The tips of high grass can barely be seen above the low-rolling bank of mist."
