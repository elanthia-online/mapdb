    "description": [
      "Composed almost completely of cobblestones and only a few patches of exposed dirt, the path becomes more well defined as it continues northward.  To the west a large hedge rises up high above the ground, its encroachment east seemingly kept in check by the tightly packed stones of the pathway.  One section of the hedge is less verdant than the others, though, and bears clear signs of fire damage."
