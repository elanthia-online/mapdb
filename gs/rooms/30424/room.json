      "Large rocks and irregular-shaped reefs create a strange pathway that leads from the open water of the Western Waterway towards the eastern cliffs of the mainland.  Dim light flickers from within a jagged split in a sheer wall to the southeast, its yellow-orange light revealing the yawning mouth of a cave.  Waves crash upon every piece of land that rises from the watery depths and creates a fine, misting spray that dampens the air."
