      "Converging from every direction, four paths meet in a ragged junction, their dirt surfaces crowded with wiry grass, pockmarked with tiny holes, and scattered with loose stones.  At the center rises a weathered post, its lantern crown faintly askew, metal darkened by age and damp air.  Around the clearing, young growth presses hard against ash, beech, and fir, the spry trunks thrusting upward to pierce the canopy only to spread their own leaves as they contribute to the gloom."
