      "Rusted buckets, some so corroded that their bottoms have decayed into a red-brown mesh, lie scattered around a copper-chained bilge pump.  Strands of thick white cobwebs coat the tangled mass and are pocketed with darker cocoons of spider eggs.  A particularly hairy grey spider scurries from the mass toward a pile of rotting straw that protrudes from one of the cells."
