      "Several sunny yellow armoires painted with interlocking rose vines stand in a neat row along the outer felt wall, their bright panels set in tall, rectangular frames.  Fleece blankets lie draped over plump qiviut cushions scattered across an intricate tapestry rug strewn with flowers in varied stages of bloom.  Small clay stoves sit at intervals around the space, each sending up a steady warmth that fills the chamber."
