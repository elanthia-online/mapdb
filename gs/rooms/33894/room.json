      "The faint breeze sweeps across the cliffside dining area, the scent of saltwater and florals gently ushered in as the sounds of crashing waves echoes from the blue-green waters below.  Lattice-woven chairs of cushioned wicker encircle the linen-draped table, the center graced by a glass-petaled lantern blooming from a base of wrought faenor.  Blackened iron and limestone form an ivy-wrapped railing along the edges of the precipice, framing the silhouettes of several islands across the waters."
