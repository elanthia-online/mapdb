      "A halo of light surrounds the opening of the trees to the southwest, casting the proud trunks of the pines into deeper shadow.  The light is mesmerizing, with its floating motes of snow and hazy yet vivid colors of green, white and deeper shadowy tones of purple, blue and brown.  As the trail descends to the north, the trees arch closely over it, as if drawing together to whisper to each other.",
      "An ethereal halo of moonlight surrounds the opening of the trees to the southwest, casting the proud trunks of the pines into the deepest shadow.  The pale silver light is mesmerizing, with its floating motes of snow, and hazy shades of green and white, and deeper shadowy tones of purple, blue, and brown.  As the trail descends to the north, the trees arch closely over it, as if drawing together to whisper to each other."
