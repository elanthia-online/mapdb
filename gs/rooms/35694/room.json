    "description": [
      "Irregular blocks of stone in variegated shades of teal compose cyclopean masonry to either side of an entry arch ten times the height of a man.  The ruin's lofty ceiling is far from intact, cracked in some places to reveal swathes of sky and breached in others by towering trees hungrily pursuing the sunlight.  Vines curtain the walls, but do not entirely obscure carvings along their faces depicting magnificent beings.  Many of the etchings are graced with flaking gilt."
