      "Dark shelves line the walls, crowded with leather-bound volumes and racks full of painstakingly preserved scrolls.  A gleaming marble fireplace adorns the far wall of the cozy chamber, its tall plaster hood tapering gracefully into a spear-shaped point near the ceiling.  Tall mullioned windows permit moonlight into the room from the darkened landscape outside.",
