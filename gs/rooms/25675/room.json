      "A narrow hall leads from the Bard Guild to the public Performance Hall, its passage a dogleg from east to north.  Sconces mounted to the walls throw a flickering gold light across the hall's dark grey walls.  The only other ornamentation is a carpet runner that follows the passageway's crook.  A small flight of stairs leads to the backstage area."
