      "Iron-barred cells stretch along the narrow hall, each confining warped armor bound in heavy chains and tagged with rusted plaques.  Between the cells, tallied etchings score the stone amid claw marks crusted with old blood.  Light from dim lanterns swaying overhead flashes across the walls as unseen footsteps echo with the clink of phantom keys."
