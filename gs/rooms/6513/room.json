    "description": [
      "The ancient highway has become almost impassable.  Its double tracks are so deeply rutted, the rocky outcrops are reminiscent of crooked teeth in an open maw.  A dried streambed intersects the road's trenches and winds north toward the lake, its passage marked by a jumble of stones and pieces of driftwood.  To the south and west, the forest is a dense, impenetrable wall of green."
