      "The valley constricts to the southwest as the mountains appear to press in closer.  To the northeast it widens with the mountains giving the opposite impression.  They seem to move away, allowing the valley floor to spread out and giving one the choice of following the western slope or crossing over to the eastern slope.  Neither choice looks particularly appealing as both sides appear to have the same unexciting terrain."
