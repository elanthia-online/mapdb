    "description": [
      "The floor of the bridge of black granite is largely free of debris larger than a stray stone, but cracks and crevices lurk in the unleavened darkness.  Glowing fungus drapes the near walls, climbing in shimmering veils toward crumbling passages hidden in the darkness above, but the rock is slick and treacherous, offering no sure handholds.  The fungus's natural light is feeble and extends less than a finger's breadth from its surface, as if the oppressive darkness were conspiring to hold back its radiance."
