      "The oppressive heat and humidity are amplified by the lack of any portal to the outside, denying shoppers even a moment's respite.  Coiled around the mullions and trusses supporting the glass ceiling overhead are large vines soaking in the ample sunlight.  Below, succulent plants are displayed along the beams separating the pens from the walkway."
