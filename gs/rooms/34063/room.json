      "Atop a tiered dais of white rock stands the ruined remnant of a runestone.  The monument resembles a spent candle, the stone melted and bubbled as if devoured by great heat.  Silver streaks traveling through the black stone glint like moonlight off of a flowing river.  Pale orbs of ancient crystal are set into the ceiling.  Silvery light spills down with a brilliance that outshines the nearby torches.  The radiance illuminates deep-graven carvings on the glossy stone walls."
