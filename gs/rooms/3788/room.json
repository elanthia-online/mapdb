    "description": [
      "High cliff walls enclose the canyon, leaving it a bowl floored with gritty sand where the night weaves deep shadows around the perimeter.  The cliffs are rugged and sheer, their faces scarred with cracks and the striated pattern of sedimentary layers.  In the center of the canyon stands a rock pedestal with a flat top.  While its form is rough, it still bears the appearance of having been carved by something other than the elements."
