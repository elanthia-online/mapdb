      "Creeping myrtle spills across the pathway, its violet and white pinwheel-style flowers clinging to their waxy vine amid shiny green leaves on long arching stems.  Clusters of plum and citron-hued hellebore shelter in the shadows of the high cliff wall upon the west, their dark blue-green, leathery foliage complementing the charcoal grey of the granite.  Opposite, bright white flowers decorate a pale green bunchberry bush that is dappled with scarlet berry clusters."
