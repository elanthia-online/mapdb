      "Whorls of pure rhimar rise out of the ground, the clusters fused to dove grey granite in a wide half-circle that stretches northeast before disappearing over the cliff's edge.  Within the ore and stone ring sits a dazzling sky blue glacier that is perfectly smooth and exquisitely reflects the sky above with mirror-like precision.  Alpine black sedge and blue sow-thistle spill freely across a narrow dirt track that leads higher up the mound, while those plants closest to the ancient ice are stiffly rooted in place and coated in hoarfrost."
