    "description": [
      "Stretching from the nearby chapel and ending some several yards away, a wrought iron fence encloses a single crypt, menacing in its appearance with the overarching edifice adorned with an exquisitely rendered but contorted face at the peak of the lintel.  Each corner of the granite is clasped by a monstrously clawed hand, as if the face and hands are but a prelude to a hideous monster clamoring over the crypt's shelter.  A bent and twisted opening between two bars of the fence teases possible access to the crypt."
