      "Dimly lit by frosted glass lanterns, the office features smooth marble walls inlaid with decorative stone patterns.  A carved desk, fashioned from a solid piece of black basalt, stands near a display of finely cut geodes, showcasing the dwarven craftsmanship and each pieces natural beauty.  Fidgeting slightly, a rotund dwarven clerk moves between the display, the corridor opening, and the desk."
