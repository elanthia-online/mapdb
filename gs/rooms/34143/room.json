      "An old yet sturdy dock juts into a calm section of the mighty river here.  On the opposite shore, a similar construction stands.  Fairly overgrown, the remnants of a wagon path lead up a high hill standing amid a sea of aspen trees.  The scene is cloaked in a low mist which slowly undulates up from the river, spreading out across the land."
