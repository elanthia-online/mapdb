      "Strange fumes create a haze in the air as they explosively escape from the putrid ground and fill the air with an aroma akin to rotting eggs.  Withered plants lie limply where they grow and are covered with fuzzy bits of white and black mold, while thin rivulets of muddy waters flow downward towards the distant watercourse.  Though not visible, the insistent hum of hundreds of mosquitoes can be heard from all around."
