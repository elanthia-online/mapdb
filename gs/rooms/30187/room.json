      "Shelves full of packing materials line the brick walls of the little shop, making it seem more cramped than its limited space would suggest.  Guarded by a carved statue of an emperor penguin, the counter has a small stand holding envelopes and stampbooks.  Crystal-globed candles occupy sconces on the walls, lending a pleasant beeswax scent to the air and brightening the surroundings."
