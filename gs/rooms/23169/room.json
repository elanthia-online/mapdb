      "A scalloped wooden overhang encloses a dingy white ceiling whorled with gold flourishes accented by hints of color.  From somewhere within the central column of the carousel, a tinny, off-key melody filters into the air, while the column's exterior is decorated with scenes of carnival games, booths, and a variety of fantastical creatures.  Overhead, strings of glass-globed lights span out like spokes from the center of the carousel, shedding an amber light onto the bobbing wooden carousel creatures below."
