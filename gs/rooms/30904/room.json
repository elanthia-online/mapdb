      "Narrow walkways thread between bulky props and scenery flats.  A variety of lanterns hangs overhead, offering different ways to manipulate the light shining down on a stage.  The green room is at the western end of the tunnel-like corridor, with an open door that reveals a collection of chairs and small tables."
