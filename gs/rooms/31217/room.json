      "This elegantly furnished bedroom casts a quiet spell of calm.  Time has aged its wide modwir plank floors to a warm brown, softened by simple hand-woven rugs.  A matching quilt is pulled back from the pure white linens of the four-poster bed, where plump pillows lie invitingly.  On the side table rests a lit oil lamp and a crystal vase filled with freshly plucked sea lavender.  Billowing sea-cotton curtains frame a distorted reflection of the room in the leaded glass windows along the far wall."
