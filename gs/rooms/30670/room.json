      "A multi-hued glaes floor spans the entire width of this room with the exception of two raised platforms carved from pure obsidian.  Blackened stone podiums rise from the platforms, facing each other from either side of the chamber.  Eight curved benches of solid ebonwood, padded with layers of siren lizard hide, have been positioned near the podiums so that audiences may listen and participate.  A heavy glaes footstool rests beside either podium."
