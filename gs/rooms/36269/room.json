      "Guarded from the outside world by a steel portcullis, this area seems to serve as little more than a buffer for the main building.  Two arched stone doors stand to the north, ready to swing in or out at but a moment's notice if the need should arise.  Several cots and benches have been arranged along each wall, neighbored by sturdy racks stocked with nearly every kind of medical implement.  A pair of large golden banners hangs from the ceiling, proudly heralding the keep's entrance."
