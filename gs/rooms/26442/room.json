      "A long-abandoned lighthouse waits just offshore, silhouetted in the darkness against the silvery white, moonlit horizon.  Its carved, stone block walls rise sharply from its forgotten perch on a jagged, black shoal.  Centuries of buffeting winds and battering seas have not diminished the fortitude of this silvery grey sentinel to remain at its post, standing guard over no one at all.",
