      "Numerous candles are placed in small groupings along the walls, their warm glow lending an intimate light to the room.  A crystal-paned counter stands to the north, the wares within it gleaming softly as the flames waver.  Chests are positioned to either side of the counter, while several shelves line the walls above."
