      "Some wild grasses have taken root here, but the ground is too sodden for any to thrive.  They droop under the weight of heavy rain and wilt without the nourishment of the absent sun.  Not far in front the large ring of obsiadian spires at the center of the island, a hemisphere of dark blue zorchar on the ground is aligned with one of the columns."
