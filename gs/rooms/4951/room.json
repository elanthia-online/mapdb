      "The heavy boughs of the pine droop low as they fan out from the tree trunk, and the dense fur of the needles creates a raincoat for the sheltering pine.  Stray beams of sunlight filter through the needles.  A ring of stones surrounds a patch of blackened ground and a thick matting of fallen pine needles provides a comfortable bed for the weary traveller.",
