    "description": [
      "Moist and almost unbearably hot air surrounds you, making it hard to even breathe in the soothing fragrances that permeate the small room.  Barely large enough to accomodate the slatted bench and copper brazier, the steam room is artfully decorated with tiled mosaic walls.  The relaxing combination of warmth and scents help work out the aches and pains acquired during the day."
