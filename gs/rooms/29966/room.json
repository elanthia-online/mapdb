      "A crumbling red stone maw in the southern wall opens onto a vast nexus of cavernous catacombs.  Flickering blue torchlight beckons from the vast aperture, the distant light casting the intersection into starker shadow.  Wide tunnels branch off in each of the cardinal directions, suggesting that the construction is not natural, but the walls, ground, and ceiling are rough natural stone shot through with vast ruddy veins of ore."
