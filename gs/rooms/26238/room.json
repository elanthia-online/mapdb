      "Daylight filters in through the thin canvas of this large, festive tent.  Pieces of bright, multicolored cloth festoon the room from the peak to each corner.  Most of the area is wide open, allowing for a large gathering.  A tall glaes-framed mirror stands off to one side of a particolored flap."
