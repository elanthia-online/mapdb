    "description": [
      "Scattered along a rocky shelf beneath the waves, the broken remnants of an Ashrim galleon have come to rest, though they are mostly overshadowed by a capsized hulk still buoyed above the waters by air trapped belowdecks.  Sea anemones sway on the deck of the drowned ship, their stridently colored tendrils fluttering on currents that stir ragged shreds of kelp.  Tiny crabs dart between the crevices of the wreckage, stark orange shells standing out like cut citrines against the dark wood."
