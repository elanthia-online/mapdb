      "The tumble of fast-moving water suffuses the air with constant sound and a glimmering display of light dances through the trees that edge this stretch of grass and thick scrub.  The remnant of an ancient tree fills this clearing.  The sheer breadth of the stump and its ragged summit overhead can only hint at the once great majesty of this forest king.",
      "The tumble of fast-moving water suffuses the air with constant sound and the rough, gnarled boughs of trees give way here to stretch of grass and thick scrub.  The remnant of an ancient tree fills this clearing, its height bare of bark and bleached to the mottled hue of bone.  The sheer breadth of the stump and its ragged summit overhead can only hint at the once great majesty of this forest king.  A rough track cuts through the woods to the north."
