    "description": [
      "A constant roar drowns out all other ambient sound as the Mistydeep River cascades over a lofty, wide precipice into this rocky gorge.  Near the base of the massive falls, a fine spray fills the air above the roil.  Buoyant mist paints shimmering rainbows above the expansive basin that fills this horseshoe-shaped cleft in the forest.  Moving away from the falling torrent, the water settles into a smoothly rippled pool."
