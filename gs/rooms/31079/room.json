      "Wheat-hued rattan woven into a herringbone pattern stretches across the ceiling and is supported by bright white pillars of pine.  Conical-shaped fishing baskets hang upon the pale green walls, the bottles within reflect the sunlight in prismatic patterns about the space.  Plump floor cushions of beige and cream encircle a wood-framed low square table at the heart of the grass-green bamboo floor.  A thin sheet of linen opposite a slanted greyish door provides a modicum of privacy for the bedroom beyond."
