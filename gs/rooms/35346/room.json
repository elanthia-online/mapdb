      "Arranged along the northern wall, a refurbished tobacco wood desk is attended by a young half-elven clerk who greets visitors and answers questions with aplomb.  Several hooks with either tags or keys hang upon the wall, each tidily labeled with a room number, and a wide cork message board allows visitors and locals to leave notes for one another.  The eastern and southern corridors lead toward the inn's guest rooms, while a door to the southeast offers egress."
