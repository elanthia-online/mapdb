      "A stately figurehead of algae-spotted oak juts from the prow, its carved figure that of a nixie with proudly imperious features.  Salt-encrusted rigging drapes across weathered rails, where paint flakes off in ragged hanks like peeling flesh to reveal rusted metal underneath.  The whipping breeze is sharp with brine and bitter with the hot copper smell of rust, and beneath both is a stale undercurrent of mildewed and rotting wood."
