      "Woven walls of birch bark are supported by roughly hewn ash posts to create a tall and circular workshop with a smooth dirt floor.  Broad workbenches dominate the central space, while lashed shelves house various leatherworking and blade sharpening tools.  A lantern hung from the peaked roof provides amble illumination for a small river reed basket of parchments and an unfinished rough oak box of ice skates that rest near the entry."
