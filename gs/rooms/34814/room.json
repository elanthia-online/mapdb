      "Family portraits, some badly damaged by the elements and age but nonetheless lovingly framed, hang over the stretch of hallway.  Doors leading off to guest suites come in a variety of woods, and each is incised with the stylized silhouettes of local fauna, from wolves to penguins.  Sweet beeswax candles in sconces along the walls light the way in the absence of windows."
