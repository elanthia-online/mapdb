      "Decorative copper wire is inlaid into the dark wood along the upper reaches of the paneled walls, the swirling designs chasing each other around the room.  Wrought iron lanterns shed their light from chains that dangle from the ceiling, their window panes etched with birds in flight.  Resting beside a pot-bellied stove, and built into the back of the wagon, is a curtained bed with drawers beneath, while a series of suspended ledges display dyes in glass bottles."
