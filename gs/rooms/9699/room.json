      "The high wall of a looming edifice borders the trail along the north side, while thick stands of the black-barked trees stand like a towering palisade to the south.  With the overhanging branches of the trees, the path takes on the appearance of a tunnel, with occasional beams of sunlight dappling the craggy stone surface of the ziggurat's face as breezes stir the foliage.",

With the overhanging branches of the trees, the path takes on the appearance of a tunnel, its length stretching away into the shadowy darkness."
