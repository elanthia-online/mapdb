      "A curious silver-framed painting hangs on one of the smooth grey stone walls, and a pastel cloud-painted ceiling rises overhead.  A display stand encasing a dark compendium sits in one corner of a gleaming white marble floor.  There is a carved mahogany wardrobe on one side of the shop and a wrought iron rack on the other."
