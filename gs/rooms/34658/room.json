      "Brightly colored bottles catch the sunlight streaming through the wide bay windows facing the street.  They cast fragments of bright color--scarlet, green, and indigo--across the other wares in the showroom, an eclectic collection of wands, amulets, potions, and other arcane implements.  Atop a pedestal of carved ebony, a glass display holds a sliver of plinite the color of absinthe, but the crystal is spiderwebbed with deep cracks."
