      "The hold would be spacious, if not for the piles of rotting sail, frayed hemp ropes, and leaking casks heaped toward the warped plank ceiling.  A large puddle of murky water spans the short distance between a red door and a blue door.  Toward the rear of the hold, an old ship's wheel dangles horizontally from a thick, iron chain and supports a few stubs of tallow candles."
