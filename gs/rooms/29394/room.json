      "Light from several crystal lamps bathes the spacious pavilion in a warm glow.  Brilliant amaranthine wool felt lines the walls helping to keep warm air inside.  Several racks of instruments placed about the shop show off their masterfully crafted wares.  Resting on a mistwood stand is an ivory parchment."
