      "A huge hoarbeam tree has far outgrown the boundaries of its species, stretching its enormous limbs toward the sky.  Spherical lanterns are suspended from braided iron links woven through the old giant's gnarled branches.  Within a hollow at the base of the still-living colossus is a grand hall open to the elements.  A series of steps formed from the tree's twisted roots rises up to the hall's cavernous entrance."
