      "A beam of moonlight shines through a narrow opening revealing a jumble of stone blocks and wooden beams.  Clearly, this ruin was once a room.  The remnants of a table lie shattered under a fallen block.  Bones, scattered and gnawed, litter the area.  A large monir cabinet, rotten with age, has toppled on its side revealing a dark tunnel leading southeast.",
