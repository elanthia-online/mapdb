      "Resting side by side, a small peaked ger and a silver-striped niveous canvas ger are framed by the rolling grasslands at their backs where moonlit-swept blades ripple under passing breezes.  To the north, a birch sapling fence encloses a paddock filled with brindled sheep, stoutfoot roltons, and Saens Valaire goats moving in loose groups across the interior. In the open grasslands to the southwest, Mhoragian muskoxen doze amid the tall, waving blades."
