      "Haloed by sunlight streaming in through the ruined ceiling, a half-circle of immense chairs stands atop a dais choked in thick vines.  Each of the huge stone seats stands far taller than a man, though that has little deterred the epiphytes that have found purchase in the dark stone's cracks and crags.  Above the dais, gilt highlights the outline of a faded carving taking the form of a two-headed boar with a magnificent mane."
