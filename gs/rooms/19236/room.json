      "A tall, yellow brick wall totally encloses this grassy area.  The expanse of wall is only interrupted by a pair of open gates.  A neatly cropped, dark green privet hedge rises about five feet, following the wall around its entirety, above which evenly spaced torches burn to brightly illuminate the area.  Centered in the lawn is a glowing silver portal."
