      "Slats of polished bamboo form the floor of this spacious retreat, while the walls are lined with tubes of the plant cast together with thin strips of hemp.  An energy chime sits off to the side while several soft cushions are scattered about a hammered copper brazier in the center of the room.  Several large bonsai trees are placed about a carved stone fountain that gives off a soothing trickle as the water tumbles down the rocky falls."
