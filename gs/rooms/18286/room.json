    "description": [
      "Flanked by thick foliage to the east and the deep cerulean sea to the west, the rocky cliff begins to narrow as it meets the sandy beach.  Rising from the ocean, the thunderous sound of crashing waves create a rhythmic beat accompanied by the thrum of nocturnal creatures.  Perched upon one of the slender, bent trees, a trio of seagulls sleep quietly, their heads tucked carefully beneath their wings.  Carved by the elements, thin slabs of sandstone sidestep down the rocks in a slippery passage to the beach below."
