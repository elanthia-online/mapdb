    "description": [
      "The pitch sealing the hull of the ship has dried and cracked, allowing in a constant trickle of seawater to join the murky flood already drowning the corridors belowdecks.  Tattered hammocks float on the surface, still attached to corroded hooks, their coarse canvas tattered and nibbled by fish.  Waves pound the outer hull, making the vessel shiver as if with fright.  The air tastes of brine, mildew, and a ghost of old tar."
