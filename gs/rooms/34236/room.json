      "Gusts of hot gas whistle up from the belly of the vast cavern beneath the overlook, meeting colder drafts near its ceiling in a clash that whips the air currents into blasts that scour the stony rim.  An almost overpowering odor reminiscent of vinegar lingers despite the efforts of the subterranean breeze.  Below, a strange complex of porous, crumbling stone spreads out from the base of a vast, pale crystal, much of which still lies buried beneath the earth."
