      "Pale ivory walls rise from the mottled green marble flooring to meet a lofted matte gold stucco ceiling where a crystal chandelier encompasses much of the space.  The warm golden light from the chandelier reflects in the crystals, sending fragmented rainbows dancing around the room.  Scattered along the walls, several crystal vases stand on pedestals, each one filled with dozens of vividly hued roses.  On the western wall, a stained golden oak door stands between the adjoining hallways."
