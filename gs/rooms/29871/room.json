      "Palpable melancholy drapes the marketplace like a funeral shroud.  The bustle of business between residents is muted, and its pace languorous.  Following the example of a singed wooden store, most shops have their doors open to the interminable twilight, though the candles winking from their windows do little to light the thin thread of road weaving between the buildings.",
      "Silence drapes the marketplace like a funeral shroud.  Shops have their doors shut against the interminable twilight, and only a few candles, mostly spent, lend their dying light to the thin thread of road weaving between the buildings.",
