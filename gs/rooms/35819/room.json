      "The scent of resin hangs thick in the air, mingling with the faint tang of freshly cut wood.  Racks holding bundles of branches, sorted by grain and length, line the walls, and sawdust gathers beneath a mahogany worktable in neat, untouched piles.  A wide hearth burns at the far wall, the fire steady but strangely cold, while shadows cling to corners, their edges diffused in the gentle glow."
