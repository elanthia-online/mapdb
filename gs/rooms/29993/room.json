      "Craggy debris strewn across the path appears to have spilled from a breached red stone wall to the west.  The rush of wind through the pits solicits a ceaseless low moan from the breach that rebounds in the distance as a melancholic echo.  Paintings adorn the walls as high as the eye can see, depicting scenes of brutal triumph that likely provided little comfort to the resultant dead."
