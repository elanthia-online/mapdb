    "description": [
      "Drifting up in tendrils towards the circular opening in the roof of the hyrrad, fragrant smoke lingers in the air as it releases from the riverstone firepit taking up the center of the enclosure.  Dried berries and herbs, tied together into bunches with lengths of string, hang from the corners of the flexible sapling limbs that hold the frame for the doeskin walls.  A pile of tanned furs occupies the corner, and a collection of bows, shields and staves in a variety of rare woods takes up an entire section of wall."
