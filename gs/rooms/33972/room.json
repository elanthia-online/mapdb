      "Dense foliage crowds the cobblestone pathway, and overhead, the trees weave together in a dark green, light-blocking canopy.  Along the side of the path, leafy kudzu completely obscures several objects, and a few tendrils have hesitantly sent out feelers onto the moss-covered path.  Wavering back and forth at the slightest breeze and untouched by any voracious greenery, however, is an arrow-shaped sign pointing to the east."
