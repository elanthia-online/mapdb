      "Spindly branches of blackened wood extend across the sanguine-splattered ground, casting macabre shadows over the small abandoned dwellings within the neighborhood proper.  A single tapered branch pierces through a nearby window, the wood covered in wispy cobwebs extending in a fan-like shape."
