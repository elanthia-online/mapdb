      "The path winds along the relatively flat top of the ridge, circling around a huge pile of craggy, reddish boulders.  Dozens of lizards of a variety of colors and sizes crawl and skitter around the rocks, resting or hunting for food among the cacti and tufts of dry grass.  A rocky trail leads down along the canyon wall."
