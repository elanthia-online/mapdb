    "description": [
      "The shanty is no architectural marvel.  Its boards are uneven, letting in frigid moonlight and the bitter night wind.  The latter whistles through the small space, making pots hung over the fireplace rattle and setting nosegays of dried snowdrop and wintersweet swaying.  The flowers hold the smell of brine and fish at bay.  Beyond a small cot and an old rocking chair, there are few furnishings to commend the shack as an abode."
