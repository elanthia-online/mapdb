      "Torches lashed to spears dot the path as it ambles through a landscape blanketed by peat moss, dispelling the darkness brought on by the closed canopy of the forest's densely packed trees.  Here and there, openings in the blackberry shrubs reveal small huts surrounded by an agglomeration of pink-tufted piri-piri bur.  Luminous standing stones draped in curtains of moss lurk just beyond the outer edges of the torchlight."
