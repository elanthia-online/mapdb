      "Twining close to a grass-covered wall, the path slips in and out of pools of twilight as it meanders through the dark forest.  Sprawling across the entire length of moss-covered ground on the western side of the path, a heavily corded hornbeam creates a yawning canopy with its curving branches, the shade of which keeps all other growth from sprouting within its shelter.  Opposite, an oil-soaked torch sits in an iron bracket bound to the wall and illuminates a wrought iron cell door."
