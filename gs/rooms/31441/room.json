    "description": [
      "The walls of the room are covered in wool cut-outs of fuzzy penguins, flippers held high as they appear to descend down their parchment slide.  The workshop is situated with a glowing brazier, providing warmth to the room, alongside the thick peppered pelts lining the floor.  Across from the brazier is an ora-banded barrel set next to some work tables, the working area complete with a long tool rack hung above for easy access.  Wood paneling frames the doorway, accenting the overall design of the room."
