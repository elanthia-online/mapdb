      "High granite walls hem in the area on the north and west sides, blocking the flow of bones and channeling them off to the south.  Despite the heavy gloom, an interesting formation is evident on the west wall.  The stalagmites are tightly bunched and extremely narrow, forming cylinders of various sizes that creep up the wall.  In many places these cylinders have broken open, leaving holes in the stalagmites and making the formation look like a long series of panpipes."
