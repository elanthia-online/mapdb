      "The trail terminates here at a badly scorched rose bush.  Nearly three-quarters of the foliage has been burnt away, and the roots on one side are completely exposed.  The remaining roses are a crimson hue, but their beauty serves only as a jarring counterpoint to the extreme damage visible across the rest of the bush.  A wide furrow of earth has been dug out, as well, in the area just around the heart of the damage, the exposed earth likewise blackened from extreme heat."
