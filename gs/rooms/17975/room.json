      "Silken tapestries woven into hypnotic patterns line the walls of the serene office, suffused with the glow of hand-blown glass lamps set on small tables in each corner.  The centerpiece of the room is a low desk constructed of polished ebonwood in a simple, elegant design, and cushioned mats are arranged on the floor in place of chairs.  A large window consumes most of the north wall, looking out on the peaceful garden outside."
