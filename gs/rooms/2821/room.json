      "The forest grows close and thick, crowding the path with low branches, their tips buried in drifts of snow.  Shafts of light angle down through the trees here and there, cleanly defined in the twilight created by the heavy foliage.  Every so often, clumps of snow fall to the ground from above with soft plops, dislodged by wind or one of the squirrels, which caper frenetically through the upper regions of the pines.",
