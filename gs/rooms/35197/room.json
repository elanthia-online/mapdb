      "Though dusty and dimly lit, the small shop is tidy and well organized.  A copper-edged polished oak counter sections off a space where the gnome tinkerer can work uninterrupted by the customers on the opposite side.  Recessed into the wall, a hive of honeycomb-shaped containers houses a variety of gears, springs, chains, and casings, while tools are housed upon hooks in the wall.  Hooks in front of the large window display several clockwork pieces that are for sale."
