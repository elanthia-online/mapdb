      "A leaf and dirt-caked fireplace serves as a focal point of the expansive study, the muck-stained stones framed by twin mahogany bookcases littered with discarded garbage.  A pile of armchairs lays scattered between scattered books and wooden planks tossed between the cushions, the torn pages strewn across the floor.  The far corner is piled high with discarded knickknacks and containers, the contents obscured by a sheet of mud-stained oilcloth."
