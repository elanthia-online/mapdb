      "Transitioning from a wide lane to the south, the path narrows perceptibly and curves through a grassy plateau that is surrounded by the bustling city, the Vornavian cliffs, and the slopping city walls.  All manner of equine, bovine, caprine, ovine, and porcine noises can be heard from the various paddocks, stables, and stalls that dot the area.  Though each structure and fenced enclosure appears well-kept and clean, the coastal winds still occasionally pull unpleasant odors from their vicinity."
