      "A view of the verdant, water-soaked landscape is interrupted by thick perse vines creeping over the exterior sandstone blocks and translucent glaes windows set at regular intervals around the entire room.  A small oaken table surrounded by mismatched chairs offers meager provisions, the bread loaves stale and the water jug nearly empty.  Stacked along the wall, a pile of torches and kindling stand ready to signal any signs of distress."
