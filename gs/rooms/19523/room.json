      "Cool water flows gently down smooth stones into a quiet pool surrounded by dense vegetation.  Blush pink lilies drift languidly across the calm water, while the glimmering scales of colorful fish are visible below the surface.  Silk-padded benches ring the pool, offering a peaceful place for rest and meditation."
