      "The tops of birch, oak, and yew trees as well as the peaked roof of a large temple rise above the myrtle hedge that runs along the south side of the esplanade.  Vornavis' Canal Gate is visible to the east, Jastev's Temple complex on the north side of the esplanade just west of here, and Solhaven's Town Hall is visible further along the street to the north.  An unassuming brick walkway leads south from a break in the tall hedge.",
      "The tops of faewood trees enshroud the peaked roof of a small temple rising above the myrtle hedge running along the esplanade's southern edge.  Near a budding linden tree with a narrow crack in the ground at the base of the tree splitting the ground at its base, an unassuming shrouded walk proceeds through a break in the hedge.  Vornavis's Canal Gate is visible to the east, rising beyond a glaes-studded steel archway.",
