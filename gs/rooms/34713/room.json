    "description": [
      "Dark grey paving stones march in neatly ordered rows between meticulously cultivated planters boasting scarlet canna lilies and black dahlias.  Dusky grey steel tracery gleams harshly from the dark stone facade of a majestic fane beyond the garden's edge.  The building strives vaingloriously into the sky, its stained glass windows ablaze with dancing firelight from within.  A steel prayer gate adorned with metallic flames opens onto the street outside, but the noises of the outside world are distant and muted as if in reverence."
