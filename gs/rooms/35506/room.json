    "description": [
      "Arcs of translucent silk stretch between the wide open pavilion and the cliff's face, creating a sheltered cliffside courtyard awash in sea-cooled air.  Pale tiles curve outward like unfurling petals around a gold-veined stone fountain of still water, its surface scattered with fallen hollyhock blossoms.  A gentle trickle echoes from the fountain's narrow spout, while crystal display stands surround it, their surfaces laden with wares or gently glowing orbs.  The scent of salt and bloom mingles faintly as the wind stirs nearby fabrics."
