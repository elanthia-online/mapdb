      "Brass lanterns decorate the dark walls and provide the small room with a dusky illumination that is just barely enough light to see by.  A series of cushioned brass stools stand before a polished driftwood bar that has a button-inlaid top, while glass shelves on the back wall support decanters, small barrels, and jars of various liquids.  Bands of moonlight spill through the open door that decorates a windowless wall.",
