      "Hooded figures stand along the streetside, carved beautifully from lustrous dark grey stone.  One statue is taller than the rest, robes draping her oddly elongated limbs.  The facades of the surrounding buildings are ostentatiously ornate, featuring bas-relief thorns and grotesque faces, each more comedically hideous than the last.  Dirge Row bends away from the encroaching walls of the city, turning toward the southeast."
