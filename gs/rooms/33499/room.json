      "Reserved for special guests, front row seating overlooking a dirt racing track features wide fleece-padded benches with ample leg room between the rows.  An elaborate gold-threaded hunter green banner depicting a savage rivalry between a menancing horned rolton and a fierce ebon wolf hangs over the railing.  A serving wench balances a mug-laden tray on her shoulder as she weaves her way through the crowd offering refreshments."
