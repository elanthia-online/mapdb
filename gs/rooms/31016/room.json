      "Quiet as a library and illuminated better than one, the incredibly tidy shop smells of newly pressed pages.  Incredibly smooth white walls are covered in several framed instructions on the art of making paper.  Standing alone in a halo of light, a pedestal displays several mechanisms, while tucked against the wall near the exit is a small hexagonal cubby housing a few parchments."
