      "What remains of a pair of enormous stone doors lies in pitted wreckage to either side of a ragged acid-pocked gash leading deeper into the cyclopean mausoleum.  The ruddy stone of the floor is etched deep with smooth gullies formed by the same corrosive substance.  Over the doorway, a graven bar features a spray of ominous-looking runes."
