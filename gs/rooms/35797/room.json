      "Lush and vibrant with the brilliant colors of thriving plants, the garden flourishes so close to the waters edge in its disorganized fashion.  Roses of various hues, orchard trees laden with ripe fruit, as well as a lilac bush and some meandering sweet honeysuckle, all lending to the sweet-smelling air.  A small fountain sits centered among the growth."
