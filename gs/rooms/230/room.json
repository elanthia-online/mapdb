      "The distant sounds of the merchants and tradesmen around the shops to the west are muted here.  The cracked pavement, scattered cobblestones, and dirt drainage ditches along the side of the road form a not-so-gradual transition between the busier avenues of the main bazaar and the less frequented, humbler, and more unsavory sections of the town.",
