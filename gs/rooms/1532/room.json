      "Townsfolk pass by on their way to or from the plaza to the east.  A large wagon stands in front of a closed workshop on the street's south side, where a pair of brawny Giantmen are loading up new barrels.",
      "The ring of hammerfalls echoes along the cobblestoned length of the street between the cut stone residences.  In his open-fronted workshop, the barrelwright hammers an iron hoop closed -- glancing up from his work now and then to nod to a recognized passerby.  A stack of oaken barrels stand ready for pickup, while piles of curved staves line one wall of the shop."
