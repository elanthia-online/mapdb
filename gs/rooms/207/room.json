      "A round bell tower, capped with a dark lapis-tiled spire, occupies the center of the courtyard.  Atop the spire, the silver and sapphire pennant of House Illistim waves slightly in the breeze.  An ironwood door appears to be the only source of egress from the tower.  Near the top of the silvery blue stone structure, a small window is barely visible.",
