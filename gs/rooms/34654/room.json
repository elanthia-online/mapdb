      "Tiny golden sigils are set into the surface of the marble block walls of the atelier, also gracing a rectangular marble slab at the center of the chamber.  The sunlight streaming into the chamber is heavily stained with the colors of the windows, a collection of cobalt, scarlet, and burnt umber shades.  An interlocking pattern of gold and bronze chains is set into the floor and encircles the slab's base."
