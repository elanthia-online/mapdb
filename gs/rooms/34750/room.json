      "Silver-shot indigo steps descend to a dome-shaped chamber lit only by nautical lanterns.  Their briny smell suggests that their feeble flames are fed by whale oil.  Walls of thick glass hold back the press of dark water in every direction, the lanterns' light offering only the faintest glimpses of black shapes swimming and squirming through the water.  At the center of the chamber sits an altar cut from a single great chunk of seaglass.  Over it looms a statue of an eel devouring its own tail."
