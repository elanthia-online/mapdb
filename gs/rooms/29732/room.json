      "Tufts of blue-green grass stick out at odd angles around the posts of the nearby corral, the thin and wide blades rustling in the chill alpine breeze that slips through the area.  Above, bright blue, red, and green canvas is sewn together in patchwork fashion to create a simple awning that protects those in the corridor from the biting night-time gusts."
