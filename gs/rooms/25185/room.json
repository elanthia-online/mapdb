      "Sweat and horseflesh conspire to form a tangy musk around the open-air business, which is astir with dozens of patrons with dustcloaks and knapsacks full of clothing, all gathered around a high counter at the center of the area.  A small fel sign sits atop the counter.  Stalls with horses and the occasional yierka line the western wall, tended by a team of sweating and overworked grooms.  The clank of wagons departing and arriving is a constant addition to the din."
