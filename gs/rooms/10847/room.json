      "A modest yard of neatly trimmed grass grows along the embankment of the south fork of the Tempest River.  Cattails and rushes grow in abundance along the bank.  Across the river, travelers and an occasional rolton can be seen moving along the river road.  A small, open-sided shelter stands beside the shoreline.  A weathered building, erected on dozens of barnacle-covered pilings, juts out over the reed-choked shallows.  Moonlight illuminates a narrow, shell-strewn path leading east along the river.",
