      "Frosted globes in bright white provide a soft incandescent light to the small tent, illuminating all visible surfaces and casting shadows upon the fur-covered ground.  Clusters of woven containers are either arranged along the edge of the walls or dangle from the support posts, their brightly colored contents spilling from them in a wild array of hues and textures.  A single loom sits under the highest point of the tent and is surrounded by tufts of fleece."
