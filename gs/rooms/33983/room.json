      "A chandelier of jagged crystal hangs along the high beams of the foyer, the shards casting shadows across the expansive travertine floor leading to the gargoyle-set fireplace dominating the portrait-laden side wall.  Iron-railed staircases frame a marble statue at the center of the room, the figure obscuring the long hallway branching off into the interior of the manor.  Brittle veils of webbing cover the vases arranged along the perimeter, the decaying flowers drooping down towards the uneven carpet."
