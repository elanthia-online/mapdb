      "Great brambles grow to either side of the poorly marked path through the thick briar.  Their snatching thorns are brittle and coated with a sheen of ice that makes them look like fanciful confections of crystal, but their bite is as cruel as that of the knifing gale.  A few iceblossoms peek from within the tangled growth as if taunting from their spiked sanctuaries."
