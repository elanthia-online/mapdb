      "A heavily scarred desk is situated opposite of the entrance to the room, and behind it stands a grizzled half-elven clerk.  Strung along the walls is a length of thick rope hung with an odd assortment of items.  Leaning against the desk, in easy handreach of the clerk, is a large, armed crossbow.  The occassional squawk of a river bird passes through the poorly constructed walls of the room, along with the scent of wet earth.",
