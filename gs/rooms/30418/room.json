      "Crystal clarity permits the water to reflect strongly the orange-pink coloration of the coral reef beneath these ocean depths.  The easterly current, swift and sure as it is throughout the bound waterway, does not mar the sea here with the darkness abounding in the majority of the channel.  Though never quite calm, this stretch of water sways more rhythmically tranquil in its normal tidal movement."
