      "Gnarled sugar pines grow through the cracks in the rocks, splitting the large boulders apart into smaller fragments.  The soil in the area has been denuded through the actions of fire, water and wind, exposing long slabs of rock between which strips of soil maintain the vegetation.  Holly bushes compete with squat spruces and the tough sugar pines.  The stunted appearance of the growth suggests either a lack of soil nutrients, sparse rainfall, or both."
