      "A wide grassy field protected by a large enclosure sits to the west of the path, and a large piece of transparent glass serves as a window to the world within the large habitat.  A subtle breeze blows through the enclosure, stirring the grasses and leaves on the trees that rise up from the ground.  An ebon-feathered cockatrice can be seen moving about the field."
