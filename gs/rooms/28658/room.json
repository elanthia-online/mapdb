    "description": [
      "High in the watchtower, the bower's four mullioned windows face the cardinal directions and provide an unimpeded view of the surrounding forest and path below.  Sparsely furnished, with only a fur-covered large featherbed and two storage chests, the stone-walled chamber is comfortable but lacks the lavish adornments and hospitality of the accommodation below.  A basket of sticks sits next to a fireplace, over which hangs a silver gilt-framed mirror."
