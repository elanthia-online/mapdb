      "Jagged rocks about waist-high to a giantman part in a narrow cleft that shields entry into the interior of a rugged cave.  Tide-swept jetties of white water wash into the rocky opening, the fast-moving remnants of a whirlpool to the west.  The surrounding sea is rough and dark, almost midnight blue in coloration, with a pronounced easterly current that slaps against the cave-side rocks with steady regularity and uncompromising rhythm."
