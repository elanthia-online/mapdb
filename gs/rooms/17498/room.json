      "Placed strategically to provide a panoramic view of the surrounding meadow, wooden benches are scattered about.  The middle plank is missing from one of the benches, and from the gap, a thornberry bush thrives.  Its thorny vines are intertwined through the rest of the wooden frame.  Shoved behind a tree, the crumbled remains of a stone structure are unidentifiable, except for what looks to be an eyeball staring heavenward."
