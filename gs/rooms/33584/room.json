      "The road bends sharply around a small tree-covered hillock, pitching a gradual slope to accommodate the rise and fall of the landscape.  Thick underbrush along each side has been cut well back from the edges of the trail.  The sparse forest lining each side provides some lovely glimpses of the surrounding area, as travelers traverse through the woods."
