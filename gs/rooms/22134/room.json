      "Warm, brassy light spills from a carefully positioned sconce, pooling on the surface of the burled maple desk below it and casting mossy shadows on the spring green rug.  Partially obscured by an artfully draped linen swag, a darkened window takes up much of the west wall, with gliding pinpricks of light beyond it hinting at ships on the bay.  The bulk of a pale rose velvet armchair is tucked into one corner of the small study, beside a low bookshelf of carved cedar.",
      "Sunlight streams into the small study from a broad window centered in the west wall, which provides a breathtaking view of Solhaven Bay only partially obscured by a low-hanging swag of artfully draped linen.  Lofted on spiral-carved legs, a narrow burled maple desk is positioned against one wall, while a low bookshelf of carved cedar rests against the wall opposite.  Tucked into one corner of the chamber is a pale rose velvet armchair, a braided spring green wool rug stretched out before it."
