      "Elaborate wine racks of the finest metals hint that this room may once have been a true connoisseur's pride and joy.  The years, however, have not been kind, and disorder and disarray now permeate the space.  Wooden crates, some splintered and shattered, line the walls, and broken glass in colors from green to brown to clear glitters in tiny shards strewn across the dirt-covered floor."
