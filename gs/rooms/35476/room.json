    "description": [
      "The trees give way to a narrow, yet lush, lawn of grass which rings a country manor.  The sides of the dwelling are wooden shakes, and its roof is slate, most of which is covered with the vivid emerald of living moss.  Large rhododendron bushes frame a bright green door banded with iron and emblazoned with a painted soaring kestrel.  Dense forest stretches away from the lawn on all sides, the foliage filled with the distant call of birds."
