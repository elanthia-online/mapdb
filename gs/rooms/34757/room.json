      "Roaring flames of gilt frame the steel of a hammered arch leading to the temple's narthex.  Mirroring stairways of grey marble lushly clad in runners of flame-hued velvet curve away from one another as they ascend to the upper reaches of the fane.  Along the southern wall, an elaborate mural depicts a preternaturally beautiful woman with dark skin and sharp grey eyes standing beneath the wings of an immense draconic figure."
