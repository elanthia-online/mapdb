      "Cold breezes sneak along the street, shivering the branches of pine trees in the abounding yards.  Small burrows with doors painted in vibrant reds or stark blacks occupy the faces of flanking hillocks, but there are just as many above-ground dwellings.  Most have a vaguely unwelcoming look, though one brick home has a small orchard of wintercrisp apple trees out front.  The few lamp posts along the way have bases depicting robed figures with shrouded features.",
      "A cold breeze catches up with you, sending shivers down your spine.  Smaller, halfling homes line the streets, looking like over-sized toy models when compared to a human or giantman home."
