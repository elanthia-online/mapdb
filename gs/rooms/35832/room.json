      "Bright harlequin silks sweep into high panels, their diamond patterns shimmering in the glow of drifting motes.  Woven baskets are anchored to the pavilion's support posts, each filled with ribbons, feathers, or baubles that spill color into the space.  A crescent counter stands at the center, its motley cloth covering flanked by mannequin heads that model extravagant hats with silent flair."
