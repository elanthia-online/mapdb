      "A simple wicker wreath hangs above the entryway, the thin twigs making up its body tied tightly with bits of twine and leather.  A pale white staircase slowly ascends in a spiraling fashion toward the top of the tower, the stone chipped and marred by stains in some places.  An iron-barred gate stands before the steps, ensuring a secure point to check those who would venture further."
