      "Rich ivory granite walls provide a stark contrast to the warm polished mahogany floor.  A tall intricately carved lor grandfather clock is set against the right wall, while a vibrant tapestry bearing the image of a crest hangs on the left.  A sweeping dual staircase leads to the upper floor, creating an alcove occupied by a carved lor table.  A clear glass dome centered in the ceiling allows sunlight to bathe the area.",
