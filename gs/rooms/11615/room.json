      "Leaves and small branches from the surrounding trees float on the surface of a dark, brackish pool.  Condensed moisture from the trees drips sporadically into the pool with a sound that is strangely melodic.  The boggy ground around the umbrageous pool is devoid of footprints.  The soft moonlight barely filters through the fog and casts no reflection on the surface of the pool.",
