      "Raw, unrefined walls ascend towards murk and a silver mist that shrouds the distant ceiling.  Echoing off the stone, the constant sound of dripping water fills the damp air, though its source and origin are difficult to determine.  Tiny tiles spread across the smooth floor to create a sprawling mural that is illuminated by the nearby luminescent toadstool."
