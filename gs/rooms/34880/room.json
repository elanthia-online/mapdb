      "A few hardy wildflowers have established a foothold in this garden between and betwixt the ferns and the fungus.  Tall stalks of golden creeping jenny display their bright yellow petals overhead, mimicking the look of misplaced suns in the nightime sky.  Amber gemstones the size of boulders line the path here, relecting the colors of the moonlit flowers high above."
