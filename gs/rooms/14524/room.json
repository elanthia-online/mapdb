      "A huge candlenut tree sticks up out of the grass, a lone sentinel of arboreal life in a dry, desolate place.  The tree's wide leaves are teardrop-shaped and lobed, clustering together to give the plant a spreading crown.  Clumps of grape-like, rubbery brown nuts hang from various branches, their surfaces glistening with oil."
