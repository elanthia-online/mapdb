      "An old, dusty altar is set in the center of this small raised area.  The wall behind the altar is bare except for a row of five rickety levers connected to a thick rope that leads upward.  Each lever has been painted a different color: yellow, blue, brown, red, and green.  The torch light flickers ominously across the walls and pillars that brace the heavy stone ceiling."
