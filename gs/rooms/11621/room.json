      "Weeds grow tall between the tracks of the ancient, rutted road.  A few scattered pieces of bone and some rusted chain mail can be seen in the middle of a thicket of thorns.  The moonlight gives the fog a bluish tint, the color of a dead man's skin.  Both the eastern and western ends of the road disappear into the eddying fog.",
