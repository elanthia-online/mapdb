      "A ticking longcase clock sits between a pair of closed doors in the middle of a short corridor leading northeast to a grand staircase.  Opposite the doors, a bronze-framed oil painting hangs above a heavy mahogany desk, a thick leather-bound tome lying open on it.  A rolling cart supplied with fresh towels and folded blankets is parked to one side of the hallway, while a maidservant pauses to dust a marble gargoyle sculpture."
