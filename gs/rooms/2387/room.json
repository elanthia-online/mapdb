      "The Nightowl Pub stands at the end of Pilsner Avenue, the grimy windows along its north-facing facade looking out over the span of West Road.  A single lamp post stands out front, its base etched with a relief of spread-winged owls in flight.",
      "Pilsner Avenue ends at the West Road, although you can see that another road continues beyond this intersection.  A tall, narrow, wooden framed building, apparently hastily constructed some years past, houses the Nightowl Pub."
