      "Warm shades and cool ones, printed and solid, metallic and matte, the patchwork fabric sashes forming this shabby tent create a cacophony of color.  A triplet of matching end tables, one missing a handle and all of them scuffed and worn, define the space.  One table with a deep gouge and its back to the central pole supports a silver-veined white marble stand with a small chip.  The one with a missing handle stands against the outer wall and bounds the space on the west, just as the third well-worn end table resting near a pair of painted silk privacy screens draped with ribbons and lace bounds it to the east."
