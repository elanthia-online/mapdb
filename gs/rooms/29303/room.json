      "This small space is lit with glowing lanterns that dangle from a rack that hangs from the ceiling.  An assortment of items have been placed atop a long, low mahogany table in the center of the room in front of a midnight brocade upholstered couch, both of which rest on a plush burgundy carpet that covers the floor.  Floral scents, spicy smoke, and soft luminescent light linger in the cozy confines of this intimate lounge."
