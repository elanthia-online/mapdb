      "Despite the worsening condition of the exterior of the tower, the inside is clean and neatly furnished with numerous bookshelves.  The grass making its way between the cracks in the cobblestone floor has been meticulously trimmed, and the walls behind the pewter-caged lanterns providing illumination have been scrubbed clean of soot.  A lacquered linden table has been carved to follow the gentle curve of the circular tower wall, its surface covered by a woven sapphire blue table runner."
