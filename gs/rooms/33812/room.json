      "The stench of sweat and oiled metal has infused the area, and the ground holds crumpled piles of ruined armor plates.  Numerous cots fit along a wall, some even built into the wall with a connecting ladder to the floor.  A stained stew pot bubbles with the day's meal in the center of the room."
