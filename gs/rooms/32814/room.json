      "Tall curved arches of verdant foliage enclose the open air garden, the structures entwined with lanterns of gilded glass draped at various intervals across the soft grass.  A square of mahogany planks sits in the middle of the garden, inlaid with a stylized eahnor wyvern framed in enamel dragonstalks.  Placed behind a gilt-clawed table is a fortress-painted screen, the vellum revealing faint silhouettes of the band as they organize their instruments."
