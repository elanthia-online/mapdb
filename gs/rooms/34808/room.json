      "Mullioned windows with cerulean velvet curtains allow moonlight into the chamber, the centerpiece of which is a rough-hewn table of honey oak ringed by chairs.  The opposing wall is given over to a long aspen bookshelf holding countless tomes, its glass doors criss-crossed by wrought iron bars brushed with silver.  Patterns of gold leaf frame the coffered ceiling, highlighting a painting of battle in the streets of a port town.  A trefoil arch opens onto a parlor, while a smaller pine door leads to the kitchens."
