      "An overwhelming number of spectators crowd closely together along ebon-painted benches, the lack of fresh air forcing those in the front row to hang over crimson banner-draped railings in order to catch a breeze.  Stacked in one corner, tapped barrels of cheap wine drip onto a sawdust-covered plank floor.  A rolton pinata covered with golden fleece hangs by a noosed rope overhead, a pile of sharpened sticks scattered below."
