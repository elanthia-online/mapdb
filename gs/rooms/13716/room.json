      "Two amber-hued sandstone pathways converge at a circular white marble center lined with curved benches facing a small fountain.  Shadowy outlines of flora mix with evening primrose, night phlox, pink soapwort, and vesper irises, the night flowers filling the garth's expanse with luminous petals and haunting scents.  A lilac tree and an aloeas tree cast shadows in their corners, and tiny stone trails wend off the main pathways, leading to scattered benches amongst the garth.",
      "Two sandstone pathways converge at a circular white marble center with benches and a small fountain.  Bright flora and cultivated healing herbs fill the four quadrants of the garth, lined by low hedges of hawthorn.  An aloeas tree turns its moss green leaves towards the sun in one corner, and a large lilac tree, heavy with silvery lavender blooms, spreads across another corner.  Small stone trails lead to various scattered benches."
