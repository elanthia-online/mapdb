      "Dusty tomes, most showing signs of mildew and water damage, are stacked in disarray on the wooden shelves lining the walls of this old library.  The plaster walls are badly cracked.  A moldy journal rests atop a mahogany pedestal standing near the southern wall.  A large, faintly glowing crystal is set on sculpted riverstone stand."
