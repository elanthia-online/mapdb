      "Icy winds whip through the upper chamber of the lighthouse, making the flame burning at its center dance drunkenly.  The smoky glass panes of the windows encircling the chamber permit a dazzling view of the landscape in every direction, from the dark waters of the Frostmain to the rugged landscape further inland.  Fingers of frost glisten from the windows' edges."
