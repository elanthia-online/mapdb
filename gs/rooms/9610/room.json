      "Three large tents are pitched in the quiet corner of the grotto.  Tall weeds have grown in the small amounts of soil that have collected in the calm areas against the tents and rock face.  The small cavern has been carved into the mountainside slightly, and the stone wall arcs somewhat overhead."
