      "This warm inviting room is filled with the wondrous smells of flavorful dishes.  A huge open hearth fireplace and brick oven dominates one wall with smells of freshly baked bread filling the air.  Bright copper pots and crystalline vessels hang by hooks above a large counter.  On a small side table, plates of fresh food wait to be prepared."
