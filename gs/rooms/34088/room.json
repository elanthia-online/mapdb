      "Weathered iron slats crisscross one another to form a sturdy cage that has a matching door with an enormous lock fitted into it.  Lights are visible beyond the open metal walls, the bright yellow light providing a modicum of illumination.  A rain barrel, fed from a run-off that disappears through the ceiling, sits in one corner, while a wide bench appears to serve as a bed."
