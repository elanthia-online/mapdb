      "This large office is tidy and well-decorated unlike the rest of the asylum.  A stone wall is decorated with a prestigious framed award above a wide glass case containing jars that display various-sized brains.  The back wall is completely shielded by floor-to-ceiling bookshelves that serves as a backdrop to an elaborate ironwood desk settled in front of it."
