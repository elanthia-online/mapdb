      "On first glance, this chamber looks like the others -- until you notice a slick, icy pile of rocks against the far wall, and the frozen corpse slumped beside them.  Upon closer inspection, you discover that the ice-glazed body is frozen to the rocks themselves.  Nothing short of a thorough thaw will free the pitiful soul for a proper burial."
