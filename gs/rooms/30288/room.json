      "Snaking its way around this cramped room is a long line of Zul Logoth residents awaiting service, most wearing impatience on their faces.  A uniformed clerk is stationed behind a dingy stone counter, next to a shiny grey glaes stand stocked with mailing supplies.  Occupying most of the western wall, a wide notice board has been tacked up with numerous papers."
