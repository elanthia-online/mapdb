      "The roadway widens and refines its borders as it rises out of the suffering valley below.  Paved with dark stones, the road winds up toward the plateau above.  A vantage along the roadside provides a glimpse of the destruction below, which is as beautiful as it is terrible.  Streams of lava lay draped across the blackened land like glowing lariats, and fields of shattered obsidian glint harshly in the wan moonlight."
