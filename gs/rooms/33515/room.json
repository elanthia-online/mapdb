    "description": [
      "The dirt floor is nearly hidden by a carpet of rolton and wolf fur rugs, all in various states of wear and tear and in a variety of hues.  Much the same are the walls of the slapdash wooden shelter, each covered by and insulated with the furred hides of both predator and prey.  Small ramshackle curios sit here and there, filled with jars and bottles of odds and ends, solids and liquids, while a four-legged scrap wood table takes center stage in the space, illuminated by a black iron-framed lantern above."
