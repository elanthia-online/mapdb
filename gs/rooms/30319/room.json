      "Piles of snow and boulders dominate the edge of the river where a slush-covered track provides egress in and out of a small encampment.  Beyond the track, exposed sinew stitching decorates the hide-covered exteriors of a domed tent built against the gnarled shrubs.  A wrought iron basket filled with oiled rags and logs rests a safe distance from the tent, shrubs, and trail."
