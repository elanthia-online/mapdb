      "A long, waterlogged velvet carpet runs the length of the hallway, guestrooms lined symmetrically along its breadth.  A pair of tarnished brass candelabra flank each door, the candles inside burning brightly and dispelling the pervasive darkness.  In the flickering light, a fissure can be seen in the western wall."
