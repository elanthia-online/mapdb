    "description": [
      "The high-peaked ceiling of the pavilion stands tall against the framework of ebon-stained mahogany, the jade-colored silks complemented by leafy naefira garlands filling the area with a heady, floral fragrance.  A quartet of velvet-backed chairs face outwards toward a collection of cushioned benches, the maedatha carpet bisecting the floor, running upwards towards the dais.  A vase-framed table is set between the audience and the dais, the polished surface simply adorned with a jade-carved inkpot."
