      "Faded cobalt blue paint decorates the walls, while a border of Solhaven Bay scallop shells rings the room near the dusty ceiling.  Faded pennants hang from the rafters amid brass-wrapped lanterns and a thick carpet of Vornavian silk covers the cobbled floor.  Leaning against a broken weapon stand is a glass and brass display case."
