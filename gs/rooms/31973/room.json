      "A soft, somber refrain drifts throughout the edifice, originating from a trio of faceless minstrels in the corner of the room.  A lone arrachd figure sits near a high shelf, plucking the strings of his mandolin while resting upon a giant burgundy pillow.  A crystalline red glass display case stands near a warped wooden door."
