      "Blocks of deep crimson marble shine eerily in the moonlight, grey veins winding across them sinuously.  Across the huge dome to the south, the opposing towers of Lornon and Liabo contrast sharply with each other, one a pale moonlit spire, the other barely visible against the nighttime sky.  A large altar crafted of the same type of marble stands in the center of the platform, a thick scarlet leather tome resting on its surface between two tall tall blood red candles."
