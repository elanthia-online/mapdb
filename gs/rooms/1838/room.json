      "Surly dwarves grumble in line, clutching their coin-purses to their chests.  Opposite the doors is a high, black steel counter.  A spectacled dwarf is perched behind it, squinting at you from atop his tall chair.  All around him, bald heads and flailing hands bob up and down frantically.  The clinking of coins mixes with giggles of glee from the back."
