      "This tiny restaurant only has a few seats, most of which are empty and waiting for customers.  Bright yellow paint and ocean views in blue frames adorn the walls, which are lined with windows that overlook the roiling waters on the horizon.  Floating between the cramped tables, a distracted waitress moves plates to and from a kitchen window that produces delectable aromas.  A blue mandolin has been mounted above the entrance of this establishment, while a sturdy chair has been placed nearby."
