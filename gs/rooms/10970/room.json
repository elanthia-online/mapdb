    "description": [
      "The northern end of Silver Park is less crowded than its southern counterpart, lush with a large expanse of carefully groomed grasses.  Playground equipment of all kinds dot the land, frequently in use by gleeful children and adults.  The centerpiece of the city park, The Silver Park Carousel, dominates the southern end of the grounds - a testament to the artisans who poured their heart and soul into its construction."
