      "Giant holes have been punched into the makeshift walls of the room, the sections of fencing and broken bits of ships still covered in netting-tangled barnacles and rotted seaweed.  Rusted tin buckets litter the dusty ground, spaced between the wide jars of cloudy liquid caked in layers of dirty wax and hair.  A trio of torn canvas bags sits heavily upon a sunken patch of flooring, the containers surrounded by a graveyard of desiccated insects."
