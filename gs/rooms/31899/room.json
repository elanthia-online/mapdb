      "A thick curtain of star jasmine blankets the crypt's cobbled stone walls, offering a touch of color to an otherwise gloomy area.  Empty bottles repurposed into candle holders line the floors amidst large globs of melted wax and beetle carapaces.  Centered in the room is a nondescript stone platform supporting a large iron urn decorated in carved grape clusters."
