      "A vine-framed haon sign is strung between the tall lattice-wrapped posts framing the ebony-planked pier, the pillars linked horizontally by a high-arcing ceiling of navy-colored roses veiled in curtains of dark green ivy.  Vertical racks of wrought electrum flank each post, each filled with coils of rope, ledgers, and vial-filled crates contained behind of resaeun-etched glass.  A gilt-caged lantern sits atop the racks, nestled between rolls of dark netting and a linden-slatted signal fan."
