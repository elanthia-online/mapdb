    "description": [
      "As safe as a gate, the river runs swiftly east to west, secure against intrusion when the well-built drawbridge to the mainland is raised.  Along the riverfront, comfortable benches are interspersed with odd three sided structures, large enough to hold a giant man comfortably, but their use not readily apparent.  A fresh breeze carries the sounds of a nearby marketplace from the east, and an occasional hint of roasting meat from somewhere to the north."
