      "A mural stretches along the face of a low stone fence separating a nearby manor from the street.  Depicted in vivid paint is a battle between ten small, dark figures with stretching shadows and a brave force of adventurers.  The leader of the tenebrous coterie is wreathed in twisting flames.  An ironwork gate opens out of the center of the fence, offering access to a welcoming if wintry courtyard beyond.",
      "A few empty houses line the road here, probably vacated due to all the noise coming from the other burrows to the south and southeast."
