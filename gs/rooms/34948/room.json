      "Damp and dilapidated rugs, their scent cloying and dank, conceal cracks along the surface of a granite mezzanine overlooking a honeycombed grotto.  The sound of water dripping from crystalline stalactites echoes as it falls into a subterranean lagoon, causing ripples that glow and fade as they expand."
