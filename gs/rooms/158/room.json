      "The cobblestone wey passes between identical rows of town homes.  Built of sturdy greystone, they feature tall staircases with cast iron railings leading up to grey-pillared entryways.  On the ground floor, tall windows draped with turquoise and silver curtains reach from floor to ceiling, while the upper stories feature smaller windows, many of which are open to catch the gentle breeze that wanders through the city.",
      "The cobblestone wey passes between identical rows of elevated town homes.  Built of sturdy silvery blue granite, they feature tall staircases with silver railings leading up to marble-pillared entryways.  On the ground floor, elongated windows draped with sapphire and argent curtains reach from floor to ceiling, while the upper stories feature smaller clear glass windows, many of which are backlit by a glow from within.",
