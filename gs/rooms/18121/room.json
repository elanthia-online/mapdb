      "Condensation drips from the ceiling and runs down the black marble walls to disappear into a drain in the far corner, leaving the floor slick with moisture.  A spacious tub has been carved directly into the marble floor, and hot seawater swirls and foams within.  A metal vat is securely bolted against the wall with a pipe and a chain hanging down just above the tub.  Wide steps lead into the tub's churning waters."
