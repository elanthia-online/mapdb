      "Ornate doors of heavy bronze muffle sounds from outside of the chapel, a long chamber with a low maple ceiling that has fanciful patterns of leaves and rosettes carved into its surface.  Framed on either side by pews of sturdy spruce, a walk proceeds to the east.  A thickly balustraded stair along the northern wall spirals up into a small loft.",
      "To the right, a thickly balustraded stair leads upwards.  The low oak ceiling is carved into a fanciful pattern of leaves and rosettes."
