      "Narrow shelves of crooked, dark-stained wood line the walls, packed tight with books in mismatched bindings of leather, linen, and the occasional cover etched with fading gilt.  Candlelight dances from iron sconces and wax-dappled holders, sending shadows skipping across the uneven floorboards and a stout round table at the room's center, its surface cluttered with loose pages, ink pots, and a sleepy stack of pamphlets."
