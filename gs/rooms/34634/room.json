      "To the southwest, the high rooftops of temple complexes stretch skyward, but none are so tall as the skyscraping spire at the center of the citadel to the northeast.  Rising high above the basalt walls enclosing the complex, the spire is a towering construct of shadowed stone that seems to scrape the bellies of the clouds.  Its shadow stretches over the town, black and foreboding."
