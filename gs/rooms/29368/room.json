      "Encircling the open platform is an elaborate veil iron cagework of celestial designs and patterns, backlit from the central glow of the lantern room.  Bracingly chilly winds whip through the airy, high-placed balcony, carrying with it the refreshingly mild scents of salt and snow.  Eye-catching moonlit waves unfurl like overlapping midnight blue petals across the all-encompassing sea that surrounds the coast."
