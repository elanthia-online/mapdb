      "Pale, silvery light spills across a twining path that follows the meandering curves of buttress roots whose ribbon-like structures form a wall along the eastern edges of Bittermere Woods.  Chill air invades the swampy space as the ground transition from mud and dirt to a faint cobbled road with stones that are cast about like a child's toys by the pervasive growth of bramble and vine.  Spider tendrils, feelers for nearby vines, clog the walk, avoiding a wide wooden gate leading into the northwestern woods."
