      "Rich shades of blue and green are woven into the wave-like pattern of a thick wool carpet that covers the floor of this curved room.  Several shell-shaped divans are placed about a lacquered low driftwood table.  A trio of crystal globes hang above a small stone-encircled pool with several colorful fish swimming at the surface."
