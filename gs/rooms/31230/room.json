      "High walls of crimson spidersilk rise in a spherical shape to encompass the wide area of the pavilion.  The flames from ornate brushed metal candelabras cast a dancing glow throughout, while the sweet aroma of jasmine incense has infused the air.  Piles of soft throw pillows cling to the corners of the tent, and a curved redwood counter is nestled between two ebony racks on the back wall."
