      "The hallway leads to a series of iron-blocked cells, the scent of moss and wet hay permeating the crumbling stones enclosing the dungeon.  Several thick-barred doors hang broken from their hinges, the entryways scattered with small, dull yellow bones left broken across the empty cells.  The sound of dripping echoes across the dank walls, interspersed by the skittering of claws across the ground."
