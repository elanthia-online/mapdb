      "The bedroom is an intimate chamber, with its pine walls, over-stuffed armchair and polished plank floor.  The moonlight is dim owing to a pine tree outside which shadows the window with its thickly needled branches.  Opposite the chair, a modest bed sits beneath a group of engravings hung upon the wall in a precisely spaced row."
