      "Racks of weapons, rusted to the point of uselessness, occupy the lower story of the watchtower.  Though blunted by corrosion, the deteriorating blades were obviously once of impressive make.  Stone steps climb in a spiral toward the tower's top, proceeding behind a curved wall adorned with a large crimson banner embroidered with a rising charcoal crescent moon with a briar sprig before it."
