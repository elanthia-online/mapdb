      "Panels of black and white silk enclose the tent, loosely staked and left to ripple with the shifting air currents.  Sunlight filters through the gaps between them to stripe the shaded interior with light.  Wooden supports, sanded smooth but left unvarnished, frame a vaulted canopy hung with irregular droplets of frosted glass.  To one side rests a long and narrow table, while a thin, opaque curtain partially screens a shaded corner opposite the entry."
