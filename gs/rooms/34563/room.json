      "Starburst-cut lanterns of brass subtly illuminate the faenor racks set before a mural of an elven port, the arathiel-inset windows of the cityscape glinting in shades of malachite and lapis blue.  Lacquered hangers of resaeun dot the periphery of the shop, the seapony-shaped pieces draped in various garments set between the glazed vases filled with vellum-folded florals.  Painted across the bluish green-colored floor are several tall-sailed galleons, the various ships set across the waters."
