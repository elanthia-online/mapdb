      "Stones of many colors glint from the eastern wall, forming a sprawling mosaic across the stone face.  The artwork depicts brave voyagers, their features aglow with torchlight, in pitched battle beneath the shadow of a crystal throne.  Light from braziers burning nearby glistens off of the tesserae, scattering rainbows of radiant color across the black stone of the walls and gallery.  A towering golvern statue oversees the splendor, her metallic armor glinting with prismatic reflections."
