      "Loose debris adheres to a sticky trail leading west and to one particular spot beneath a square-shaped opening in the wall.  Within the shallow niche, a large ceramic bowl rests upon a metal sheet affixed to a rope from above.  A small steel tube juts out of the rock near to the contraption."
