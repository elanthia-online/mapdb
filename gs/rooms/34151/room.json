      "A ring of iron basket torches illuminate two large semi-circular patches of bare ground that bracket a pit in the center of the field.  Discarded bits of rope, in various states of decay, lie scattered on the ground.  Nearby benches provide a viewing area for spectators and a red and blue sign is prominently placed at the edge of a field."
