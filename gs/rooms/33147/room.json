      "Glittering crystal sconces light this ample room, their reflected light dancing along the highly polished marble floor.  Several plush chairs are pulled into a wide circle around a gold-veined white marble fireplace, above which is set a silver looking-glass.  Along the opposite wall, a huntboard of intricately carved tanik is flanked by a pair of white and gold banners.  A frost opal medallion gleams at the apex of the gold arch opening into the room."
