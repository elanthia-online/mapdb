      "Bone-white sands thin as the narrow passage curves eastward into a rounded alcove with a coral canopy.  Faint eddies stir the floor, sending slow spirals of sand drifting across the open space.  Coral branches overhead weave into a thinning lattice of red, green, and yellow, allowing glimpses of the open ocean beyond.  Shifting schools of silvery fish flash past in the distance, their bodies glinting in the filtered light.  A carved coral seat, worn smooth by time and tide, nestles against the eastern wall."
