      "Shaped more than carved, a set of footings descend in a twisting path from the expansive aerial platform to the moss-covered chamber below.  Looping branches twine together in a labyrinthine canopy filled with verdant foliage and a smattering of bright-plumed minivet nests.  Scattered amid a variety of flower-laden urns, braided circular arame cushions adorned with wild fringes provide options for reclining."
