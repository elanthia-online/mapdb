      "Stylish wall hangings are hung upon several polished wood partitions.  Ornate, high-backed chairs surround small oval tables stacked with books full of hand drawn examples of even more wall hangings.  Aromatic smoke drifts from a small brazier in the corner, lending the shop a pleasant, relaxing atmosphere, but the incense is not so hazy as to choke the customer."
