      "The north quarter of the promenade meets a quickly moving stream.  Babbling and splashing turbulently northwest, the stream flows under a short stone bridge before curving out of sight through an invar grate in the settlement's wall.  A short barrier of dark glaes protects the cobblestones near the water's edge.  To the south, a magnificent fountain rivals the noisy babbling of the stream."
