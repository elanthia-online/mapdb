      "Bundles of dried herbs and flowers are hung from a row of neat hooks driven deep into the ceiling.  Rows of golden oak shelves and cabinets, filled with silk-lined drawers, run the length of the room.  A sturdy worktable, its surface sectioned into marble, steel, and granite to accommodate a variety of uses occupies nearly all of the floor space."
