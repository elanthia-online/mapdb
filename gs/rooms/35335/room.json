      "Bright white shutters with heavy slats decorate the walls, leaving the entry and flanking windows wide open to the starlight and the cool evening breeze.  Drifting amid cabinets and display cases, the half-elven jeweler Asmora tends to customers when not working on new jewelry pieces at a nearby workbench.  The jewelry on display glitters in the ambient light created by wall-hung lanterns, creating prismatic hues on the white stucco walls."
