      "Serving as a threshold to the staircase and an archway onto the avenue, a pair of imposing sculptures depict a robed woman reaching up to touch the snout of an enormous drake, whose head leans towards her in a gesture of respect.  Intricate gold-veined tiles form patterns upon the surrounding avenue, while travertine planters filled with succulents and white pebbles line the path.  Frosted globes recessed into nearby cypress trees illuminate the avenue."
