      "Some layered walls of wavy glass cast colorful silhouettes across the pale sand, the etched surfaces projecting rays of calligraphy across the changing tides.  Garlands of anemones and sea buckthorn drape over a quartet of carved stone founts.  The water's surface alights with tiny votives floating between strips of parchment scrawled with long-forgotten names.  Carved into whimsical sea creatures, myriad charms adorn the driftwood benches sitting half-buried within the sand."
