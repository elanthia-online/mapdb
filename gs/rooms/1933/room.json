      "A pleasant breeze rustles the modwir trees which line this cobblestone street.  A magnificent establishment of pearl-grey granite inlaid with gold and crimson glaes dwarfs the other structures here.  This is Bentock's Adventurers' Rest, a second home for travellers in search of fortune and fame.  Just beyond the elegant structure, the River Muagh courses northward on its long journey to the sea."
