      "Carved of alabaster and onyx, a pair of elegant statues flanks a flight of broad mahogany stairs, their arms raised above their head as they hold frosted orbs aloft.  Ochre fleur-de-lis patterns decorate the burgundy rug that covered the floorboards, while matching velvet swatches cover the walls.  Standing opposite the stairs are a set of polished double doors."
