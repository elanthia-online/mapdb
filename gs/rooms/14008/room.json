      "This corridor is quiet, and the decorations here are minimal.  A soft carpet woven with several hues of complementary summery shades matches the lacquered golden haon of the walls.  A red iron door stands between a pair of triple-pronged candelabrum affixed to the walls, and opposite is an ora-inlaid golden mithril door and a grey-green vultite door."
