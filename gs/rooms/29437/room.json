      "Unsteady wooden tables are haphazardly arranged throughout this chamber, each topped with varying amounts of assorted scrolls, tomes, drawings, and burning candles.  Many maps are hung along the cedar walls, each with detailed notes pinned around them.  A cherrywood display case and a small oak table rest off by themselves flanking one of the corners, each with two brightly lit candles allowing ample light to study what is within and on them."
