      "Hanging on the modwir paneled wall, flanked on either side by polished mithril lamps, is a large painting.  It shows two ships locked in battle.  One, a privateer by its flag, appears to be on the verge of sinking.  The details of the fighters and ships are magnificently rendered upon this canvas."
