      "A crooked house of blackened stone leans precariously over a black algae-covered pond, the water's surface littered with scorched pieces of thatch bobbing between the dark patches of aquatic plants.  The long-tailed form of an unknown mammal stalks between the dense reeds edging the waters, causing the grasses to rustle subtly before going still."
