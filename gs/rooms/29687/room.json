      "Carved haon poles form the framework of this spacious tent with rich verdant wool hanging to form the peaked roof and walls.  A single bronze lantern dangles from a thick chain, its warm light barely illuminating the large space.  Woven from river reeds, a dark umber carpet covers the ground.  Various crates and boxes line the walls, while several baskets hang from the rafters above."
