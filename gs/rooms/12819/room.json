      "The Hall lobby is packed with people as merchants, fishermen, hunters and townsfolk alike mill about, doing their business.  A bust of the Baron of Vornavis occupies a nearby niche.  A wide staircase leading upwards is lined with gilt-framed portraits, and a brass plaque hangs upon the opposite wall."
