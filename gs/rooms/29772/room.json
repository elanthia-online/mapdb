      "Lamb's wool panels of silver fall in gentle folds along the four walls of the hovel, their tailored ends pooling on the polished oak floorboards.  Plump cushions of bronze and ebon surround a bowl-shaped metallic brazier to the left of the entry, while a polished oak desk surrounded by porcelain urns rests to the right."
