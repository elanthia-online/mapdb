      "The shop is comprised of wood-paneled walls, their surface smooth and lacquered to a nice shine.  The air is infused with the mixed aroma of various musky fragrances and weapon oil.  Upon the wall is a series of mounted heads, each one carefully stuffed and preserved.  A low oak counter stretches across the shop, bordered by rows of driftwood shelves."
