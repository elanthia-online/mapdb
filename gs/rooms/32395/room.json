      "Moonlight beckons through chinks in the stones of the shrine's rounded ceiling.  Shafts of pale radiance bathe a glistening seaglass statue of a powerfully built half-krolvin with a heavy beard, a trident held aloft in one blunt hand.  Offerings of strange golden coins and carved whalebone charms are heaped before the figure.  The air is redolent with the odor of the spent tallow candles that fill niches along the walls."
