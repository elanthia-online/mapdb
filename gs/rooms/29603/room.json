      "Jellyfish-shaped cushions with long tentacles snaking out rest atop a clear glass floor.  Beneath the floor, several varieties of freshwater fish swim obliviously in a giant pond.  The pond itself is kept flowing and aerated by a large contraption that spans from pond to ceiling.  Water wheels and buckets scoop the liquid from the pond and tumble it back out over the sides, creating a slight mist in the air.  Occasionally, a fish flips its way through the buckets to the top and back down to safety below."
