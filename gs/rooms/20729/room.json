      "Oak rafters arch towards a domed peak, with wooden shingles placed between, keeping out most forms of weather.  Benches are built in against the walls, with a small circular table centered on the floor of the gazebo.  Potted flowers hang from hooks in the windows, each opening giving a picturesque view of expansive gardens in one direction and the open ocean in the other.  A bird feeder dangles from a nearby tree, while a carved bird house stands on a post just outside."
