      "The monstrous black obsidian cliffs to the west all but obscure the sky.  Seabirds circle the enormous heights, occasionally settling along the ragged edges of the stones.  Blue-green water splashes and sloshes below, never at rest, never at peace, its sound as insistent as the mournful cries of the aerial creatures that sail and glide overhead."
