      "Rising steam forms into layers of mist and fog that turbulently shift across the surface of the opaque, pale white waters of the bubbling spring.  A stream of the upwelled water has carved its way through the irregularly shaped rocks surrounding the spring, splashing along some carved grey granite steps leading to Stone Mill Road."
