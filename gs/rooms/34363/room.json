    "description": [
      "Spanning the distance to an upper southern ledge, this bridge doesn't seem sturdy enough to support the weight of a single individual, much less a group of multiples.  Wide gaps between each of its wooden slats give a bird's eye view of the rocky cavern floor, which appears to be littered with skeletal remains.  Faint growls and snorts echo through the area, but it's difficult to pinpoint their origin, as every sound seems to bounce off the walls multiple times."
