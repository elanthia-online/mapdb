    "description": [
      "Large flat rocks cover the packed dirt floor of this wood fence-enclosed pen.  A small watering hole has been placed at one end, while a small feeding trough has been placed at the other.  In the center, a fenced fire pit has been placed, its flames casting a dull glow upon the surrounding area.  Around it, several lizards lay with their bellies exposed to the flame, basking in the warmth it provides, with only an occasional break to groom or drink before returning to their resting spot."
