      "An ancient obelisk of silver-shot ebon stone stands watch over the stretch of beach, its features corroded by the tireless onslaught of the salt air.  Briny water has eaten away at the base, leaving it peculiarly smooth.  A garland of kelp tangles around it, the fronds glazed with a thin layer of frost."
