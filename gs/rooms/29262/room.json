      "Commingling with the scent of rot and decay is the scent of roses, which can be tracked to a single pink candle that rests among off-white varieties clustered upon the sodden floor.  Leached of most of its color, a once-decorative mahogany frame holds a pictureless canvas that is dimpled with acorn barnacles."
