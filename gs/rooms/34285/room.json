      "Abundantly moist and spongy underfoot, a nauseating mixture of fish, flora, and rotting vegetation seeps into the air with each step, and an audible *SQUISH* alerts any awaiting predators of your presence.  Vultures soar high in the skies above, waiting for their next meal to appear within striking distance.  To the east, a shimmering lake serves as a large repository for the runoff from the majestic waterfall visible in the distance."
