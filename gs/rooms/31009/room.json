      "Elaborate works of art, colorful and vivid, executed upon magical scrolls festoon the bright white walls of the shop.  Sitting atop glass-shelved displays that border the airy room, deep blue glass vases frame scroll-cutting devices of various shapes and are matched in color to the small rugs arranged over the smooth, stone tile flooring.  An occasional zephyr winds in through the arched windows, ushering in soft floral scents that linger in the air."
