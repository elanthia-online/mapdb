      "A large rusty grate blocks any further progress up the pipe.  Several rotted carcasses are pinioned against the grate, flailing in the constant wash of filth pouring over them.  Carried down from the warrens of the town sewers, the sounds of boots on cobblestone and muffled shouts slip between the rush and splash of the rancid river."
