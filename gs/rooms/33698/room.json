      "Dust-heavy spiderwebs cling to the burgundy walls of the hall, their laden tendrils falling in thick streamers that stick to every surface.  Painted in alternating patterns, bighorn rams and curled horns decorate the upper edges of each wall, though their hues and metallic spirals are faded and dull.  A large wooden plaque, dirty and bare of anything to exhibit, presides over a glass and brass display case along the western wall."
