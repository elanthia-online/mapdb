      "Polished tanik inlaid with bits of colorful sea glass covers the countertops and a large island workspace centered in the room.  A pale stone fireplace fills one wall, with several smaller ovens built into the side for baking.  A large area covered in shelving is stacked with jars and bottles labeled with ingredients and spices.  Resting to one side is a wooden dry sink piled with a wide variety of foods."
