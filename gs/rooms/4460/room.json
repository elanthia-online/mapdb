    "description": [
      "Some time in the past, this narrow cavern was visited by an industrious dwarf who took his pickaxe to the wall, creating a wider space complete with a stone-hewn bar.  In a nook behind the bar, a dog, fashioned from invar and accompanied by a plaque, watches over the patrons.  Some visitors, especially dwarves, belly up to the bar for a drink, but many others drift to the east, searching for wares."
