      "Hardpack gives way to a well-worn dirt trail that bends toward the east, from whence the tantalizing promise of woodsmoke and cooking meat beckons.  To either side of the walk, great trees have been reduced to stumps too even to be the work of nature.  The divide in the canopy overhead provides a clear view of the aurora's radiant splendor.  Its regal blues, sunny golds, and alien greens bathe the surroundings in a wondrous display of gentle light."
