      "In the shadows cast from the thick canvas sails overhead, a grey-backed seagull perches atop a wooden wheel, noisily munching on a potato peel scavenged from the crew's previous meal.  Across from a wooden door leading to the Captain's Quarters is a capstan, the drum wound with thick, braided hemp rope.  Large nets cling to pegs on the ship's railings, all empty save for a waterlogged boot with teethmarks on its toe."
