      "Cherry blossom trees provide a canopy of airy pink blooms over stone benches that line the pebbled paths intertwining around vibrant wildflowers.  Keeping guard over the garden, a patinated bronze fountain, boasting two carved lions, pours off into a water lily covered pond below it.  Multi-hued flora dot the landscape, adding pops of color to the lush grass and shrubbery.  In a quiet corner, an ivy-wrapped mistwood pergola suspends glass jars at varied lengths that house assorted flowers."
