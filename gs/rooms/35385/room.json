      "Cypress and thuja trees enclose the space in deepening shade, their branches shifting softly as night settles over the colonnade.  At the northeastern point, an open passage leads to a tile-lined patio, its surface glinting where light catches the smooth ceramic.  A wine vendor lingers near the edge, a vibrant cart adorned with glass baubles casting soft, fractured reflections across the stone.  Shadows deepen beyond the trees, their outlines shifting as the night air stirs the canopy."
