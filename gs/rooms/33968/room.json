      "Several cured hides of varying quality have been strewn over the floor of this enclosed section, making the footing precarious in places.  Boxes are scattered everywhere, some open to display their contents of teeth and bones, while a guttering oil lamp hangs suspended from the roof to provide scant illumination.  The air is stuffy and smells of animals, both alive and dead."
