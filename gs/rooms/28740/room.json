      "Stout wooden kegs, each banded with iron and stamped with a white lighthouse emblem, are stacked upon one another against the walls of this room.  A long silver mirror, somewhat burnt and warped at the edges, sits in a corner beneath a colorful round lantern, the flickering flame within casting long shadows around the cellar."
