      "The curtain-draped walls of the dust-covered shop are engulfed in a myriad of shelves overflowing with knickknacks, the flat lengths of wood framing a tall ebony curio inset with panes of glass.  Dried bundles of herbs scent the air, the scattered leaves sprinkled across the mahogany-planked floor alongside tufts of cat hair.  The faint yowling of several felines echoes throughout the room, followed by the sounds of claws against wood."
