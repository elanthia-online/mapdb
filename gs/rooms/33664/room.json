      "Blue and crimson enameled wings decorate the bronze body of an enormous phoenix, which is affixed to the eastern wall.  Though much of its magnificent plumage is missing, as well as the jewels that once rested in its eyes, the gaze of the fiery bird falls upon a glass and brass display case that is placed in the center of the room.  With no windows to aid in the circulation of air, the niche smells stagnant with dust."
