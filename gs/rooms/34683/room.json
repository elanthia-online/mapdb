      "A broad stage of oak curves outward toward the audience, flanked by spills of green velvet.  The curtain to the west provides access to backstage, concealing any bustle within from the eyes of the audience.  Masterfully shaped glimaerstone spheres are arrayed on a wooden beam above the stage, shaded to provide the stage with focused light for performers.  Their radiance almost manages to obscure view of the house in a veil of luminescence."
