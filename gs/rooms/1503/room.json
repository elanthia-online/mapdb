    "description": [
      "Barges and galleys ply the length of the canal, passing beneath the arch of the East Bridge on their way towards either the seagates below Vornavis or the docks at Baron's Quay.  To the north the roofs and spires of the temples of Liabo rise close at hand, while the northern cliffs beyond the Cascade of Tears provide a backdrop to the massed buildings of North 'Haven.  In the opposite direction, the tops of the Lornon temples stand in front of the plain of rooftops and warehouses that stretch southward."
