      "Rough rocky walls covered with sharp edges slant in haphazard angles around the length of this section of tunnel.  Traces of crimson crystals nestle in clefts throughout the dark stone.  The air is thick with the stench of sweet rot.  A small bore descends into the darkness of another lower level of this treacherous matrix."
