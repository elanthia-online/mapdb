      "This end of the hall shows a lighter touch in the decor.  Pastel colors and light woods replace the heavier, darker colors elsewhere.  A curtained window open to the cool air allows a refreshing breeze to enter.  The door into Sincerity's room is finished in a light oak and carved with scenes of spring and summer."
