      "An aromatic, yet pungent, scent wafts throughout the area, its source the clusters of bugleweed in terracotta planters lining the shop's moss-embraced pine walls.  Secured above one of the planters with a burnished stake-shaped treenail is a mahogany-framed sign.  Along the floors are extra supplies of neatly bundled tiger grass and grapevines, secured by cotton twine.  Exposed cypress beams span across the room, their lengths dangling bronze lanterns caught by ivy-woven chains."
