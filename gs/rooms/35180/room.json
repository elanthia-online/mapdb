      "The room is paneled in whitewashed wooden planks, punctuated by long pale birch shelves stocked with various bottles.  Below the shelves is a row of haphazardly spaced copper hooks made from bent gears that boast a series of cooking utensils.  A wooden rack stands beside the entrance, offering a selection of recipes."
