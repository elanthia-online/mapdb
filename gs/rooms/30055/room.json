      "The burnt remnants of a tremendous balefire sprawl across the wind-raked stonework.  Heaped bones, most reduced to brittle nubs from the heat of the blaze, appear to have been the predominant fuel for the pyre.  Crude symbols drawn in ash ring the burn site, largely nonsensical but obscene in shape.  Ashes fleck the nearby snow drifts, dusting their whiteness with spots of black and more diffuse grey."
