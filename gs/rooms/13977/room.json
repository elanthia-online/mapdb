      "Tiny lanterns create pools of light beneath the striped awning, dimly illuminating several wooden benches.  Towards the stern of the ferry, a few crates have been set on end with a plank laid overtop as a rough, but practical bar.  Beyond a brightly polished brass railing, a few benches are clustered on the foredeck."
