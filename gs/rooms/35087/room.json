      "Knotted pine boards line the walls of the spacious shop, the golden wood partially covered by a variety of exotic pelts and skins.  Piles of tanned hides are stacked around a worn counter inlaid with bits of shark teeth.  Several copper and bronze lanterns hang from the exposed rafters above, casting a pale glow over the room."
