      "Moonlight filters through the branches of an ancient elm located in the center of this aesthetic courtyard, reflecting upon the surface of a waterfall fountain along the main cobblestone path.  Carefully tended wildflowers, grasses, and pathways comprise the remaining area, accented by a solitary wooden bench.  The soothing chirping of crickets and the occasional hooting of owls fill the air, a peaceful counterpoint to the stout granite towers equipped with ballistae in each corner of the courtyard.",
