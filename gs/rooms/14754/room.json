      "The broad sweep of the rush-covered floor is interrupted by a small iron dwarf statue.  Halfway to the glaes-skylit ceiling, an Elanthia map painting hangs on one of the gilt-trimmed white marble walls.  A carved haon armoire and an iron-banded ebonwood chest are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
