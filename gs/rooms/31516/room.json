      "Thick seaweed hued in varying shades of greens, browns, and greys swirls about the thick pine posts that support the tigerwood pier.  Long panels of cork line each slip, their canvas and sailcloth coverings stained with muck and saltwater.  Dark iron chains hang from a weathered post, supporting a large cedar sign that swings in the ocean breeze."
