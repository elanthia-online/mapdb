    "description": [
      "Near the base of a large oak, the thick layer of decaying leaves and other forest debris has been disturbed, revealing a shallow depression in the damp earth.  No more than two feet deep at its center, the depression may have served as a resting area for a large hound, wolf or some unknown denizen of the deep woods.  Clumps of mud and damp leaves lie scattered around the edges of the small pit, perhaps once having filled it."
