      "Chiseled into the wall between two lit torches is a detailed scene depicting the interior of a great hall.  Several polished marble pillars about waist high to a dwarf stand in a half circle atop which are intricately cut figurines that reflect the flickering torchlight.  Behind the display, dust covers the floor around a straight-backed chair and work table."
