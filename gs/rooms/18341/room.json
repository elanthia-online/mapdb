    "description": [
      "Shadows encase the thickening plant life in the outskirts of the swamp, the struggling vegetation growing denser as the muddy soil begins to dry out to a more normal semblance of jungle terrain.  Pockets of bubbling muck still occupy a few of the more water-saturated areas, even as lengths of fallen vines attempt to obscure the vicious combination of mud and water.  Further southeast, the sounds of nocturnal life echo loudly in a stark contrast to the dreary bubbling of the swamp."
