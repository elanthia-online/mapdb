      "Loud squeaks and scurrying noises can be heard from behind a rusted metal door in the north wall.  A small set of stone steps to the south leads to a massive glaes door, at least fifteen spans of a human's hand tall and eight spans wide.  Twin wall sconces hold flickering torches near each door."
