      "A small stone hollow has been carved out of the rock face in the Portico.  The walls are adorned with unfurled bolts of bright blue cloth that flow onto the floor like water.  A white stone counter is anchored to the far wall, laden with an array of small stones, dried tidepool artifacts, and flecks of sand.  Sister Tledassa stands alongside the counter, arms folded, smiling slightly.  A small opening in the rock face leads out."
