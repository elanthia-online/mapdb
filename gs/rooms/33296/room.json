      "Large and circular, the grand vestibule has a domed ceiling and an enormous crystal chandelier anchored to three points in the sandstone walls.  Wall-hugging stairs form an arch over a pair of large fel doors, a banded brown wicket discreetly tucked in the shadows of the eastern staircase, while a double-wide green feldspar archway on the northern wall offers a view of an enormous dining hall.  Emerald green and ivory tiles form a decorative tile mosaic in the circular floor."
