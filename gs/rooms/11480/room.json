    "description": [
      "The narrow coral reef barely rises above the surface of the bay.  The low, foam-flecked swells hardly break as they roll by the small reef.  A few ships' timbers, broken and whitened by saltwater and age, have washed up on the reef and lodged in the coral crags.  A sharp current prevents any movement to the west.  The low line of the mainland can be seen in the distance to the northeast."
