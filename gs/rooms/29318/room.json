      "The walls of the flannel-lined wagon are covered in well-rendered maps and spoils of war, the various items flanking a set of dark-lacquered antlers thrusting out from the fabric-covered surface.  Set below the antlers sits a tall haon-slatted desk carved with various woodland creatures, the simple writing surface covered with the faint smoke of a recently snuffed cigar.  Alternating planks of alder, blackwood, and linden cover the exposed floor, each piece burned with an artistic rendering of a vague foreign town."
