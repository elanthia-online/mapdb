      "Ribbons of sulfur-scented vapor curl up from a wide, wet crack angling across the floor of the tunnel and contribute to the heavy, humid atmosphere of the warrens.  Tiny tangerine quartz crystals encrust the rim of the crevice, jutting at odd angles, their bright surfaces beaded with moisture.  Brown stains fan out from a shallow cavity within the concave curve of the tunnel wall, but aside from a few scraps of bronze-tinted film stuck to the stone, the hollow is empty."
