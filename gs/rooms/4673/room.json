      "A quaint bungalow rests quietly alongside a bubbling brook teeming with an assortment of fish and other aquatic life, creating a picture-perfect scene.  Fiddlehead ferns line the western side of the brook, and the light of the sun brightly illuminates clusters of glossy-leafed holly trees beyond them.  A white pebble pathway following a bubbling brook leads into the area and terminates at a towering modwir tree whose broad limbs support a colorful canopy-covered shop.",
