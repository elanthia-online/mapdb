      "The broad sweep of the light pine floor is interrupted by a slender umbrella tree statue.  Halfway to the white cedar ceiling, a curl-edged vellum wall map hangs on one of the tightly-woven beige canvas walls.  Some hammered copper display hooks and a cedar and oak footlocker are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
