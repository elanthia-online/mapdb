      "A large skylight encompasses the majority of the expansive room's ceiling, bathing the room in soft moonlight.  A collection of artwork hangs on the walls, against which stands a long glass-enclosed display featuring samples of pelts and skeletons from regional creatures.  Various Terasian creatures stand stuffed and posed on a raised platform in the center of the room."
