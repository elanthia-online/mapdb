      "Two elderly women huddle over a row of basins, taking turns as they dip clothes into the water, gossiping amongst themselves as they drag the garb against rugged washing boards.  A group of children engaged in a wooden sword fight frolic through the area, causing the women to pause and look on, before they run off."
