    "description": [
      "A narrow cabin lined with oaken shelves is secured by a carved black oak hatch.  Glass jars atop the shelving hold powdered indigo, starfruit seeds, and a few drying specimens of coral.  Tanned leather pouches and crates stamped with foreign seals occupy a polished walnut counter over a bunk that, while narrow, has sheets of jewel-toned silk.  Lanterns of hammered bronze cast warm light over a thick rug softening the floorboards, weighted in place by a footlocker made from polished teak."
