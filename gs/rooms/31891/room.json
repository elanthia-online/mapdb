      "Nestled behind a stone wall between Icewild Hall and its carriage house, the unusually warm garden overflows with greenery, flourishing in the moonlight.  A cobblestone path surrounded by several ghost ferns leads to a small stone cottage, and a wild array of fragrant night phlox wraps about overflowing herb beds.   Vines of ivy, moonflower, and star jasmine wind across the surrounding stonework, edges icing over as they encroach upon the colder climes away from the garden.",
      "Nestled behind a stone wall between Icewild Hall and its carriage house, the unusually warm garden overflows with greenery, most of it closed up against the sunlight.  A cobblestone path surrounded by several ghost ferns leads to a small stone cottage, and a wild array of fragrant night phlox wraps about overflowing herb beds.   Vines of ivy, moonflower, and star jasmine wind across the surrounding stonework, edges icing over as they encroach upon the colder climes away from the garden."
