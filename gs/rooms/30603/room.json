      "Dark green walls surround this small alcove off the central nexus to the east.  The focal point of the space is a swirling green and gold portal framed by an oval of wrought silver.  Intricate foliage has been etched into the metal, the vines intertwining to form a complex lattice pattern.  A warm breeze swirls around the area, scented of the flora of Wehnimer's Landing."
