      "One stretch of the roadside is taken up by a series of overly tall buildings, their multiple storied bluish-grey stone facades standing out against their shorter, more conventional neighbors.  Though pennons are hung from silver poles atop the grander structures, the lesser buildings aren't without ornamentation themselves.  In one window, high up, a pale blue light burns cleanly, tinging the cobblestones below.",
