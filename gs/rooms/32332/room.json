    "description": [
      "Left open, the inn's stone-framed maple double doors allow in starlight and the susurrus of leaves from the glade outside.  The scents of birch and pine from without mingle pleasantly with the sharpness of woodsmoke and leather from within.  Well-appointed without being ostentatious, the establishment's entryway boasts a dark suede couch and a cathedral ceiling of raw pine.  Standing guard from a nook in the opposite wall, a stuffed snowcat gazes watchfully down at the entryway with gleaming glass eyes."
