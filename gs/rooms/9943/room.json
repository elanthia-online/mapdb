      "A wide expanse of grass surrounds you in every direction, bounded by the woods to the southwest and the rising mass of the high moors to the east.  The crumpled skeleton of a large boarlike animal lies beside the trail, its weathered bones glistening in the sunlight, while white and yellow butterflies cavort above the grass, oblivious to the evidence of death below.",
