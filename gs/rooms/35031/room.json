      "Lava seethes from cracks in the tortured earth near the narrow ribbon of stable ground.  Gouts of black smoke and superheated steam accompany the glowing, molten rock, commingling to fill the air with a sharp, metallic tang.  Flakes of ash swirl like snowflakes in the hot breeze, pirouetting and dancing as if oblivious to the land's torment."
