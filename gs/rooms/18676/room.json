      "Dark amethyst marble floors are veined with black and silver that twist and turn to resemble roses entwining with harps.  In one corner, a silver bench sits next to a marble fountain, and along the other wall, twin shelves of ebon marble reside above a lavender-veined black marble counter.  An elaborate Loenthran tapestry covers the wall behind the fountain.",
      "Inset into the pristine pink-veined white marble floor is a brilliant peacock encircled by black roses on a field of sapphire blue.  A crystalline jewelry case rests upon a black marble pedestal next to a matching counter bordered in diamonds.  A small gold plaque hangs next to a lustrous white marble arch."
