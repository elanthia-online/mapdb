      "The expansive pavilion drapes over a framework of oiled resaeun, the slender poles affixed with framed sketches drawn in ink and charcoal.  Set upon a nielira-carved counter is a tall heartleaf-edged sign, the greenish black tendrils traversing their way towards the wool-covered floor.  A lingering veil of cigar smoke weaves through the air, the tendrils floating in the ambient breeze."
