    "description": [
      "Below the unrelenting winds and rain of the upper plateaus, this fortuitous haven is surrounded by protective granite and a circular border of gooseberry bushes and is largely unaffected by the conditions above.  Evidenced by a mass of carved initials on the birch tree's trunk in the center of the pond, this is undoubtedly a popular fishing spot.  Persistent lightning strikes illuminate the sky far above, and constant thunder booms shake the ground and send waves of ripples across the pond's surface."
