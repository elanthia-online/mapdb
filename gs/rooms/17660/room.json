      "The path from the northeast widens into a large sandy dirt street flanked on either side by miscellaneous buildings constructed of wood and the occasional stone block.  Uneven wood plank sidewalks line the buildings which serve as homes and businesses.  Men, women, and children of many races, crowd the sidewalks, creating a lively atmosphere and filling the air with boisterous noises.",
      "The path from the northeast widens into a large sandy dirt street flanked on either side by miscellaneous buildings constructed of wood and the occasional stone block.  Uneven wood plank sidewalks line the buildings which serve as homes and businesses.  Torches line the street, providing uneven lighting and flickering shadows.  Men and women crowd the sidewalks, creating a lively atmosphere and filling the air with sounds of revelry and commerce."
