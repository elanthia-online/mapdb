      "Ancient statues carve from the same stone as the surrounding rock loom over the walkway, stained by primitive paints.  The carvings take the shapes of bobcats and lynxes, and despite the crudeness of the old craftsmanship, they have a predatory grace to their postures.  More paintings adorn the walls, depicting masses of humanoids engaged in acts both carnal and savage."
