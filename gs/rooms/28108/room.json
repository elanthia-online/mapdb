      "The trees grow tall at the lake's edge, the distant mountain peaks barely visible behind their towering heights.  Heavy, snow-laden branches criss-cross to obscure what lies beyond the treeline.  Only a pair of dead pines breaks this wall of foliage, their bleak trunks making a gateway to the forest within."
