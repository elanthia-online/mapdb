    "description": [
      "Softened by the glow of birdlike brass sconces, the stairway landing rests in hushed dignity, its walls clad in paneled mahogany and the floor covered with thick carpet.  Against the wall, a slim rosewood table offers a crystal decanter half-filled with stagnant water.  A red velvet rope has been strung across the opening of a darkened hallway, a small sign proclaiming the area off limits to guests."
