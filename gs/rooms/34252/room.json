      "Hundreds of large, ovoid eggs with leathery shells crowd the raised plaza.  They wobble fretfully, cradled by vesicles sprouting from a fibrous coating that amost completely consumes the pockmarked surface of the platform.  Stringy lengths of the substance form long tendrils anchored to crags in the nearby rock walls.  In the shadow of the terrace, the ground is honeycombed with waxy chambers sealed with hardened resin."
