      "To the southwest, the waters yawn wider to accommodate a vast disc of unusual stone.  Seawater runs from its uneven edges, channeled by cracks and runnels into waterfalls that fill the cleft with their rumbling roar.  A reef of brilliantly colored corals clings to the bizarre structure's immense stone base, fed by the constant rush of seawater, and the air grows colder near its all-consuming shadow."
