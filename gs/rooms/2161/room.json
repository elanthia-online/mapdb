    "description": [
      "A dangerous precipice borders the northeastern edge of the plateau, falling onto rocks far below.  In places, molten lava cascades over the edge in remarkable ribbons, sending trailers of steam and fire shooting out over the abyss.  The broken skeleton of a large beast can be seen, cradled in an outcropping of glaes which projects from the cliff's face halfway down its descent."
