      "Smooth stucco walls rise towards the peaked ceiling where evenly spaced support beams house lanterns that provide illumination throughout the day and night.  A discarded beam, left over from construction, rests beneath a shutter-flanked window, while coils of rope flank the entry.  Discarded steins, food platters, and eggshells are scattered across the top of a long wooden counter that sits kitty-corner to the north and west wall."
