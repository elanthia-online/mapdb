      "The street is barely wide enough for a mule-drawn cart to make its way.  Dark houses line both sides of the street, punctuated by the occasional burrow.  All appear well-to-do, with spacious estates whose high walls permit glimpses of ice gardens and hedge mazes flanking their drives.  Fog blankets everything, transforming nearby trees into silhouettes with snatching black claws.",
