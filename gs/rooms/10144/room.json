      "The landscape slants downward to the southeast, the sodden ground being overtaken by the dark marsh water.  Tall, slender swamp ashes form an impassable, tunnel-like barrier on both sides of the path.  Nondescript, rounded stones jut out from the meager grass, their forms a semblance of ancient crumbling ruins."
