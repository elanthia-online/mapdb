      "The cavern opens into a large chamber full of luminous blue crystal stalactites and pools of bubbling orange lava.  Nearby several pillars of igneous rock guard a plume of super heated steam jetting out of several cracks in the floor.  The steam has formed the ceiling here into a mirror polished dome over thirty feet at its peak."
