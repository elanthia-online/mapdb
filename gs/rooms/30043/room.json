      "Banks of snow cover the wide expanse of terrace, which looks out over a tall swathe of evergreens.  The snow is stark and bright against the ruddy stone of the mausoleum's exterior, looking like white linen against drying blood.  Ripples of light from the aurora make the banks glisten and gleam in ethereal fashion."
