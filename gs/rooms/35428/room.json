      "Dedicated to repairs, the western edge of the shipyard houses various hulls and ships in different stages of disassembly as they await restoration.  Wooden beams and planks lie to one side of organized stacks of wood, while pails filled with nails, wedges, cleats, and screws are arranged along the surrounding fence whose posts are capped with bright lanterns.  Workers drift back and forth, collecting supplies and returning to their assigned vessel."
