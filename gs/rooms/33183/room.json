      "Slender columns of mica-flecked black marble punctuate the walls of this room, supporting a ceiling of elegant black basalt tracery.  The hearth is crafted of the same unusual marble; set above the mantlepiece, a silver looking-glass glints oddly in the twice-reflected light.  A silver tray bearing exotic refreshments rests on a carved ebony sidetable nearby.  Above the obsidian archway opening into this room, a silvery moonstone medallion glitters coldly."
