      "Attention to detail, both in decor and wares, distinguishes this somewhat small shop.  Each table surface holds a small vase with fresh wildflowers, enough to create a pleasant atmosphere without detracting from the focus of home decoration.  Behind a long, silk-draped counter, a smiling elven lass arranges miniature replicas of the tables in the same pattern as the ones on the floor."
