      "[Flinger Basket]"
    ],
    "description": [
      "The walls and floor of the basket are woven with reinforcing strips of metal, tinted brown by decades of rust, the flakes of which have created a reddish brown stain underfoot.  Metal hooks are placed across the floor in neat orderly rows, perhaps once connected by rope or leather as a means to separate the basket's contents.  Scrapes in the rust along the walls imply that not all launches from the catapult were executed cleanly."
