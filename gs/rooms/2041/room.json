      "Tall branzila nut trees mingle with fig and mahogany trees, stretching a vast canopy of foliage overhead.  High in the upper branches, an occasional growl or screech betrays the night's predators at work.  A couple of cocoa trees, whose branches fill the forest's understory, grow with boughs full of large fruit.  A few mature pods, betraying an orange hue in the moonlight, lie along the path where animals have dropped them.",
      "Tall branzila nut trees mingle with fig and mahogany trees, stretching a vast canopy of foliage overhead.  High in the upper branches, monkeys and brightly-feathered macaws cavort and screech, adding color, movement and sound to the emerald panorama.  A couple of cocoa trees, whose branches fill the forest's understory, grow with boughs full of large green and yellow fruit.  A few mature pods, now turned a dull orange, lie along the path where animals have dropped them."
