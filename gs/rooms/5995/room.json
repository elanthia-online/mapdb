      "Patches of meadow grass dot the flat expanse of the hilltop, occasionally bending and waving in the short gusts of chill wind which blow in from the west.  The ruins of a farmhouse and a few other ramshackle buildings brood silently amid the overgrown grasses, their hollow interiors black and ominous in the pale moonlight.  A wooden archway, complete with an iron-banded gate, leads back down the hillside.",
