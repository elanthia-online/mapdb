      "A vine-choked stone villa stands beneath the imposing silhouettes of twin trees, the bower beneath littered with small skeletons semi-buried beneath the rising weeds.  A carved marble pedestal displayed before the home is filled with a thick black liquid, the ichor spilling down onto the cobbled ground."
