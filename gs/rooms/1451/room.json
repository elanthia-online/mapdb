      "A large cottage rests in the shadow of the Vornavis Cliffs.  Well-dressed patrons wander past, carrying small boxes and packages.  Rose colored awnings cover the doors and windows, and a small silver sign is posted beside the entrance.",
      "Stopping at the base of the Vornavian cliffs, the road ends in a small cul-de-sac.  A path lined with crystal lamps leads up to an elegant stone cottage.  Beds filled with beautiful flowers cover the lawn in front of the building."
