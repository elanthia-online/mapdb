      "Stone and timber alike gave way here beneath some colossal impact, which ripped the floor asunder and brought down the ceiling at the same time.  Even a dwarf might feel a bit claustrophobic in this space, with barely enough room to squeeze through the rubble.  Dark, foul-tasting smoke drifts lazily up from a wide hole in the floor, hot enough to sting eyes and lungs alike."
