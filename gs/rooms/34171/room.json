      "Broad and vaguely ovoid, an unnatural hollow opens within the mottled stone to form a chamber.  Spiraling furrows, deep and sharp-edged, adorn the curved walls and unevenly sloping floor, though the topmost curve of the ceiling appears relatively smooth by comparison.  Tunnel mouths gape at irregularly spaced intervals, their recesses cast in shadow by the pulsing emanations of an amber-hued barrier stretched taut like a membrane of light across a ragged crevice in the chamber's wall."
