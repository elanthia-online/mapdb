      "Lemon balm and lavender overflow the planters hung by the window of the shop.  The sweet scent from their profusion of flowers fills the small shop and is only the foremost of the multifarious herbal scents in the air.  Nosegays and herb bundles hang from the walls and occupy several small display tables in the cozy space.  Behind a high poisonwood counter, more dangerous herbs are kept, including sprigs of nightshade, clusters of white deathwort, and hemlock."
