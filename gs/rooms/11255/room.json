      "Despite a hint of light filtering in from the northwest it is too dark to distinguish anything with certainty in the tunnel.  Roots, damp and dripping, hang low from the dirt ceiling.  The footing is slick with slime and mold.  The stink of decay is formidable, as if foul beasts might use this tunnel as a place to die...or feed."
