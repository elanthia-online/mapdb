      "Clusters of grapes trail along the wrought-iron fence to the north, their dark violet hue standing out amidst the predominantly verdant hue of the surroundings.  A variety of tiny mahogany saplings grow along the edge of a tiny stream that meanders its way along the cobblestoned walkway, their jade green leaves flawless and pristine.  Spots of sunlight and shade chase one another in an endless dance upon the ground, their rhythmic advance and recession shifting as the leafy boughs above waver with the wind.",

A variety of tiny mahogany saplings grow along the edge of a tiny stream that meanders its way along the cobblestoned walkway, their jade green leaves flawless and pristine.  Spots of pale starlight and shadow chase one another in an endless dance upon the ground, their rhythmic advance and recession shifting as the boughs above waver with the wind."
