      "Carefully shielded lanterns provide a soft illumination for the cramped tent, the flickering metal boxes highlighting the rough stitching of the patchwork walls.  Various leatherworking tools and an embossing kit are arranged in tidy rows near the head of a lumpy bedroll, while a small parchment tube is tangled in the blankets at its foot.  A series of wooden pegs in the center of the space, and in full view of the entry, provides passersby with a full view of the abode's wares."
