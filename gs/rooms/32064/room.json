      "Multitudinous vasiform plants, in varying shades of putrid greens and deep maroons, pack the naturally terraced earth with a miniature forest that grows more vast with each consecutive tier.  Hanging from long stems, burnt orange pitcher plants dangle over the edges, their curled lips dripping with tacky liquid.  Radiant pink spheres, darker at the core, aimlessly float through the jungle-like terrain."
