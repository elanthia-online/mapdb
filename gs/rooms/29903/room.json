      "Smoke belches from the rounded chimney of a nearby smithy.  The stones comprising it are huge blackened blocks of ponderous weight.  Crossed axes and a round, notched shield hang over the high open doorway.  The quality of the work is exceptional, but the weapons and targe are too large to be wielded."
