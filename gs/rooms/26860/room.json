      "An abandoned two-story building stands nearly against the stone wall, the small space between the two occupied by a coal-eyed snowman.  The tracks of small creatures, likely rats, lead toward the gap, while next to the door, a pile of hard, dry droppings litters the front step, lightly dusted by snowfall."
