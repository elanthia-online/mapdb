      "In sharp contrast to the stone construction of the hall's floor and ceiling, panels of blonde mistwood cover the lower half of the walls in this spacious entryway.  Each panel is decorated with a row of colorful, dwarf-cut gemstones along its beveled top, where the wall transitions to smooth grey stone.  A young dwarf stands attentively near a short granite table to one side of a strip of grey-bordered, dark green carpet that leads north."
