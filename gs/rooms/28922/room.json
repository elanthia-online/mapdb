      "Cracked and broken, a burbling water pump fills a nearby iron-bound oak barrel to overflowing and is undoubtedly the culprit that has turned the roadways to mud.  Some enterprising individual has created a makeshift boardwalk of rough oak planks over the muddy ground that leads from the town gates and fortifications in the west to a squat pub with a copper tile roof built nearby.  A cool seaborne breeze trickles through the area and carries with it the sound of rattling chains.",

Some enterprising individual has created a makeshift boardwalk of rough oak planks over the muddy ground that leads from the town gates and fortifications in the west to a squat pub with a copper tile roof built nearby.  Shouts and cries echo in from the southeast, the sound of industry mingling with the warm seaborne breeze."
