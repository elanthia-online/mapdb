      "In the shadows cast from the thick canvas sails overhead, a grey-backed seagull perches atop a wooden wheel, noisily munching on a potato peeling scavenged from the crews previous meal.  Across from a wooden door leading to the Captains Quarter is a wooden capstan, the drum wound with thick, braided hemp rope.  Large nets cling to pegs on the ships railings, all empty save for a waterlogged boot with teethmarks on its toe.",
