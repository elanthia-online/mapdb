      "A lavish golden silk divider separates this area from the rest of the pavilion.  Opulent wall hangings representing each Dai brush the polished mahogany flooring, and a birch counter rests opposite a birch sideboard.  Several lush ferns and potted chrysanthemums surround a tiny burbling fountain in the far corner."
