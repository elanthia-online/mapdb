      "An intense, burning chill suffuses the darkness of the crypt.  Braziers of ancient and corroded bronze stand on plinths before recessed niches in the walls, in which the bones of the long dead slumber.  Brittle, yellowed, and collapsing into dust from age, the remains are interred in once-fine armor that has similarly succumbed to the ravages of time."
