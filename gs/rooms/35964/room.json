      "Tall, narrow windows admit slants of starlight that gleam on floriated brass sconces set into the walls at regular intervals.  Beneath the graceful curve of the stairs, an arched passageway invites you into a quiet hallway, its carpet muffling every footfall.  The faint scent of wood polish lingers in the air."
