      "Tall stalks of wisp lanterns have grown up at the end of a fallen half-submerged tree trunk that still clings to land, shooting up between the broken branches and curled dead leaves.  The toes of the tree, gangly roots made brittle by time and exposure, peek out of the water, having long since wiggled free of the soil that once gave them life."
