      "Verdant and earthy, the area is filled with dark green blades of grass that rise as tall as the average halfling.  Feathery tops slip from their protective sheaths within each bladed tendril and spill large quantities of seeds upon the moss-covered ground.  Long shadows stretch across the area from the incredibly high walls of the hedges that rise to the east."
