      "Flying cerulean standards whip in the breeze over the quartermaster's office, sporting a sigil of a horned crab and dagger in crimson.  The building is almost a palace in its own right, and its windows offer glimpses of fine furnishings and lush curtains.  In somber contrast stands the ramshackle jail attached to the office, a single-story hall with barred windows with no glass to shield occupants from the unrelenting cold.  Hulking enforcers stand guard outside with cudgels in easy reach."
