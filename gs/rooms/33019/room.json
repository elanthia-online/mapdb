      "Aromatic petrichor floods the secluded room.  Wooden pots, carved to resemble hollowed tree stumps, line the perimeter.  A mosaic of vines and healing herbs grows from the pots, creeping along the walls and ceiling.  A thick, moss-hued woolen rug stretches across the wide-planked floor, anchored by a smooth faewood log, a hollowed modwir stump, and an ancient granite monolith covered in chalk dust."
