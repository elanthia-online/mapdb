      "Spindly, skeletal-like trees dip down across the narrow dirt road, the winding pathway seemingly swallowed by the dense, dark-shadowed woods leading deeper into the grounds.  A loose scattering of gravel lays before a brass clockwork gate, the spear-shaped finials engulfed by thorny briars contorted across the entry.  Small stacks of stone line the dried grass along the path, each one stained a rust hue."
