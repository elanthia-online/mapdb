      "Intense flames roar from alcoves along the walls, their dancing radiance scattering off of viridian soulstone shards that weave along the walls like a sidewinder's path.  Standing before the inferno is a pure white altar of stone that takes the form of a scaled man with no mouth.  Along the eastern wall, a circular glass window allows daylight to join with the fiery radiance, and the altar shines almost blindingly with the reflected glow."
