      "The edge of the bluff looks like it could be the edge of the world, with the distant slopes of Pinefar Mountains stretching away majestically.  There is a fairly clear view of the Lodge presiding over its snowy lawn with aplomb.  The pines resume close to the precipice in a thick growth that protects the cottages built around their feet."
