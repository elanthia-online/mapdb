      "An ugly, jagged crack defaces carvings along the northwestern wall depicting a parade of chickens led by a crowned cockatrice.  The fanciful etchwork, still graced with some surviving gilt, is lost to either side beneath dense curtains of vines with ghostly blue blossoms.  Chasms where the stone floor has collapsed in upon the edifice's ancient foundations are home to clear pools where jewel-toned frogs no smaller than a fingertip swim and leap."
