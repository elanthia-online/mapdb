      "Painting adorns the walls to create a three hundred and sixty degree landscape, with golden grain fields rising from the floor and a pristine azure sky sinking from the ceiling to meet at a horizon dotted with trees and limned with the amber-magenta shades of a summer sunset.  Shelves with a few golden hooks beneath have been chiseled into the walls within the outline of the trees and painted to match, while an archway is set into the center of the setting sun, its pigments in harmony with those surrounding it."
