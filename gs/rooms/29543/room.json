      "Brightly lit by crystal-globed candles atop a caribou antler chandelier, the room is enclosed in walls of lacquered pine.  Facing a blackened rock fireplace, a waiting couch of dark suede sits with its back to an imposing angular oak desk with neatly organized parchments atop it.  A prim sylvankind secretary is seated behind the desk, which is positioned so that she can watch the entrance, visitors, and a riveted hoarbeam door leading to the mayor's office."
