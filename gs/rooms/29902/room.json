    "description": [
      "A grand arch of carved granite towers over the wide dirt path leading into the village.  Spacious dwellings with roofs of thatched polar grass and walls of unfinished timber are scattered haphazardly throughout the village, leaving ample avenues connected by the winding path.  Nearby, an oversized cart piled high with goat dung rests in the shadow of one of the tremendous dwellings, filling the air with an earthy and not entirely unpleasant aroma."
