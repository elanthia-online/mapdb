      "A large formation of rock slopes up the hillside, overhanging a dark, surging torrent of water rushing beneath it.  Spray from the stream wets the stone, nourishing patches of moss and intermittent clumps of plants proffering small flowers.  The expanse of rock works its way up the hillside in stepped terraces, broken here and there by low scrub brush.",

Spray from the stream wets the stone, nourishing patches of moss and intermittent clumps of plants proffering small blue flowers.  The expanse of rock works its way up the hillside in stepped terraces, broken here and there by low scrub brush."
