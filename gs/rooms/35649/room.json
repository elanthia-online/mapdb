      "Waters as blue as cut sapphires lap at the strikingly white beach, which is strewn with rubbery kelp and clumps of sargassum.  The algae are not the only secrets the sea has surrendered.  Colored glass chimes glint from where they lie half-buried in a rolling dune, while just down the stretch, a foreboding bronze bust is mostly submerged in a tidepool.  Broken idols of unknown stone and foreign coins of strange metal fan out where the sand meets the water."
