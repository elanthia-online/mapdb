      "You've entered a space which is wedged between two rows of filing cabinets and sectioned off by a mule-printed wool curtain.  Inside is a scratched modwir desk with a halfling clerk sitting behind it, peering over the mounds of paper that surround her.  She giggles to herself once, waves at you, then returns to work."
