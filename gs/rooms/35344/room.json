      "Wide floor-to-ceiling windows stand closed to the cool island breezes, their glassless faces covered by storm shutters that are tilted ever so slightly to retain a view of the gardens beyond.  Grey-streaked tobacco wood lends an earthy rustic air to the foyer, while blue slate tiles glisten in the moonlight.  Rattan chairs provide space for reclining, allowing guests to recline without interruption."
