      "The wallpaper near the table depicts a wild-looking man with lambent eyes like those of a wolf.  Woodland spirits cavort over the ornately carved tabletop, engaged in acts of play and mischief.  Pendant lamps resembling chunks of raw stone cast warm illumination over the area, and the air holds the subtle fragrance of wildflowers."
