      "Boldly painted wood forms the body of the cart, its panels adorned with scrolling vine patterns in rich emerald and gold.  Strands of glass baubles hang along the edges, their shapes resembling clustered grapes and citrus fruits, glinting with every shift of air.  Wooden racks hold bottles of deep red and pale amber liquid, their wax-sealed tops resting in orderly rows.  A small counter juts from the side, polished smooth from use, where goblets and carafes wait to be filled."
