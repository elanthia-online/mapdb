      "A frozen stream cleaves across the pathway, glinting like fine crystal in the undulating radiance from above.  Spilling from a crook between two granite boulders, the solid water looks trapped in time.  The sinuous thread of ice disappears into the woods to the north, which form an impenetrable tangle of white-dusted greenery several paces from the trail's edge."
