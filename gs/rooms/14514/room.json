      "Offering a panoramic view of the surrounding habitats, the granite tower is protected from the elements by a rippling blue canvas sail.  To the north, the enclosure is filled with a small forest that descends into a red-walled canyon, while a series of constructed sandstone cliffs stretches upward in the distance.  Perched atop a nearby column of rock, a lone griffin stands sentinel, keeping a watchful eye on both the staircase to the west and the steps to the east.",
