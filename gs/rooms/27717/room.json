      "The deep blackness of the tower's interior is permeated only by the occasional soft ray of starlight from the outside, or the mellow orange and yellow tones of sparsely-placed torches.  A few rustling tapestries line the walls, their cloth far too faded and torn away to reveal any distinct imagery.  The shallow stairs continue to wrap around the circular walls in a spiraling fashion."
