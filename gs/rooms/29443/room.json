      "Sparse and tidy, the room is part living quarters and part workshop.  A small teak writing desk sits next to a bed inset into the back corner, and a single banner hangs near a dark plaid and sailcloth curtain leading back to the main shop.  The eastern wall is covered with precisely patterned wild briars wrapping themselves around a sturdy leather trunk embossed with an onyx kraken and twining across the ceiling to frame a small skylight.  Myriad blossoms are closed up tight against the night, but dotted amidst the sharp briars, brilliant white flowers gleam in the starlight."
