      "The huge pile of bones slants down toward you from the southeast then splits into three directions, continuing on down to the northwest, northeast and southwest. Occasionally the pile itself seems to shift just a bit, or quiver a bit, rising or falling just slightly.  Even individual bones appear to move, sliding across other bones or rolling a bit before stopping.  This would not seem so very strange if the movements were not uphill at times."
