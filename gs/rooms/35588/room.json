      "A squat, dimly lit passage stretches below the main deck beneath the low and pitch-stained beams of a sagging overhead.  Near to rotting steps that climb out of the hold's hatch toward the brilliance of the day, a crooked workbench stands slightly askew.  Splicing tools litter its surface, though they seem ill-suited to the colossal task embodied by the piles of netting and loose coils of line heaped at the bench's base."
