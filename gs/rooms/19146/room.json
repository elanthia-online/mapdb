      "Large palm fronds line the walls, giving the small alcove a slightly crowded feel.  Pushed together as if to make more shopping room, a pale-colored natural wood block, a tiered silvery modwir stand, and a metal-hooked spinewood rack offer a variety of containers and provisions for the discerning companion owner."
