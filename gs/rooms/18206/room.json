      "Resplendent with a variety of coral, this part of the garden resembles a calm beach.  Lapping up onto the beach is a sea-water pool in the middle of which is a statue of Charl carved out of a large chunk of coral.  He appears to rise out of the water on a wave and with his trident raised, he is acting as the fierce protector of the seas."
