    "description": [
      "The courtyard is large and well-kept, and a small stand of haon trees periodically comes alive with the flashes of greenish light from a large colony of fireflies.  To the north, a marked off area for training is neatly arranged for drills.  Practice dummies and archery targets appear well-used but in good repair.  In the center of the yard, a brass-plated iron alarm bell hangs from an ash A-frame.  Near the double doors leading into the barracks, a single wooden bench sits beside a small table.",
      "The courtyard is large and well-kept, and a small stand of haon trees offers shade where several recruits chat amicably.  To the north, a marked off area for intensive training is filled with recruits listening closely to a retired militia instructor.  Practice dummies and archery targets appear well-used but in good repair.  In the center of the yard, a brass-plated iron alarm bell hangs from an ash A-frame.  Near the double doors leading into the barracks, a single wooden bench sits beside a small table."
