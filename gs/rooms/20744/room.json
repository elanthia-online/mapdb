      "Opening onto a vista of gardens and forest, floor-to-ceiling windows expand the space of the dining area.  A long maoral sideboard against one wall boasts refreshments.  Snowy white linens and fine porcelain adorn rosewood tables, some out in the open, while others are more private, behind square wooden columns holding the enormous exposed beams of the rafters.  Stuffed hawk-owls and eagles peer down from their perches in those rafters, while a woven runner carpets the hallway from the restaurant into the library."
