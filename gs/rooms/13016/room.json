      "This might have once been a very comfortable sitting room, but the sharp teeth and jagged claws of some beast didn't seem to care much for rest.  A dark plush carpet, now torn and slashed in many places, is doing a poor job of covering the floor, and the bone walls are bare and badly scratched as well."
