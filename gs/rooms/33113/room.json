      "A multi-paned window takes up a majority of one wall and affords a view of the forward berthing compartment.  A row of cushion-topped crates are situated around the open window.  Several names are written in chalk on the wall next to a brass-handled door, and all of the names are crossed out except for one -- Capt'n Jingles."
