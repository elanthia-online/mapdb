      "Long ribbons barely hang from the tall pole at the center of the house-filled area, their faded colors sprinkled with flecks of rust and splatters of dark mud.  Molding floral garlands adorn the contorted iron gate encircling the plaza, the blossoms collapsing above shallow puddles of brackish water."
