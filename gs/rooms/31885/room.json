      "Whitewashed walls reflect the twilight-hues of the Naidem sky as it bleeds into the small cottage through dirt-stained windows devoid of curtains.  Rough oak floorboards creak at regular intervals, though no one can be seen moving through the space as a cool draft sets trinkets dangling from the ceiling to swaying.  Tidy shelves line the eastern wall from floor to ceiling, while the western wall houses a glass-fronted display case that sparkles with violet hues."
