      "At the bend of the road sits a shrine in an overgrown bed of wolfsbane, the purple blossoms drooping mournfully over the stone carving.  The effigy, a half-dome of white marble encasing a woman with wild locks and an athletic build, has tokens and offerings heaped before it, from ribbons to golden coins.  Overhead, a gargoyle on the walls watches the offerings with dispassionate eyes."
