    "description": [
      "Dark granite walls with a slick sheen form a long east-west tunnel with what appears to be a larger open area at the eastern end.  Droplets of moisture fall from the ceiling and create a pit-a-pat that echoes throughout the corridors and resembles the sound of a light rain.  Translucid veils of mist, tinged slightly with a greenish hue, appear periodically and float in the air like clouds, only to be dispersed with the least bit of movement."
