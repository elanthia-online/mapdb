      "Two parallel lines of lichen-covered rubble that must have been low stone walls centuries ago stretch off to the east, marking the boundaries of an ancient road that now ends abruptly at the thick woods to the west.  Patches of weeds and occasional bright wildflowers grow among and around the broken stones, encroaching on the rutted path.",
