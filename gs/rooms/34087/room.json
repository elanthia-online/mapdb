      "Compact even for a dwarf, this tiny shop is filled with display cases that create a little maze.  Small bottles, jars, and tins of all types and sizes line the shelves on the wall behind a heavy-set dwarf who patiently sits on the other side of a low counter.  Potted glowing toadstools have been strategically placed around the shop to provide subdued lighting.  Rich, earthy scents of tobacco fill the air."
