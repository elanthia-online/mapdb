      "Glass oil lamps affixed to the walls provide a soft light that illuminates the wagon's interior that smells of grease and solvents.  Much like the exterior, the walls of this enclosed wagon are covered, but with shelves that display all kinds of metal trinkets.  Across from the entrance, a tall workbench presides over the space, covered with metalworking tools and metal shavings.  In front of the workbench is a table upon which a doll-sized replica of this festival's list and stands has been built."
