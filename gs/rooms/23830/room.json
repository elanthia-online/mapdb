      "The center of the stables has been turned into a makeshift office by an old maplewood counter that demarcates the workspace of a harried caravan master.  Framed by horse stalls along either wall, the hay-strewn space is well-lit and breezy, the air kept fresh by a large window along one wall that lets in a crisp, cold breeze.",
      "Motes of dust float gently in shafts of light streaming into the stable through great holes torn from the thatched ceiling.  The hard-packed floor is littered with molding straw, from which puffs of dust arise with one's every movement."
