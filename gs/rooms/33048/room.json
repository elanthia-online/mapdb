      "Blazing on high, a domed ceiling of stained glass is imbued with swirls of golden and crimson that form the lithe musculature of a spread-winged wyvern staring down upon the audience chamber.  Marble pillars, limned in fiery shades by the creature's span, foist vibrant scarlet banners bordered in washes of golden brocade.  Below, a vanguard of armored statues stands to either side of a thick red velvet carpet scaling the mass of a golden stair."
