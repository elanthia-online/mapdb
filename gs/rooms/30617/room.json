      "Frosted globes dangle from the distant stone ceiling, providing a warm light that is reminiscent of sunlight.  Smooth walls filled with wrought iron grates stretch to the west, while a tunnel opening in the east gives a glimpse of the sky.  Flanking each other, a painted sign over the left-hand cell proclaims it as \"Gaol One,\" while the right-hand cell is labeled \"Gaol Two.\""
