      "Although it is enclosed on all sides by thick walls of stone, the courtyard offers a glimpse of the world outside the keep.  The most noticeable feature is a circular pit of sand, flanked by several racks of wooden weapons and other implements of martial training.  Burlap dummies of hay and thick wooden poles have been arranged along the perimeter, each one bearing the notches and tears of frequent use.  Separate from the main building, a stone tower dominates the northern wall."
