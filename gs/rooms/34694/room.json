    "description": [
      "Ancient carvings travel in wavering lines across the towering blocks of tenebrous grey stone composing the henge.  Blood red pigment has been smashed into the carvings, illuminating them with crude smears.  They depict figures engaged in acts of mass bloodshed, the massacres raging in size from the dozens to thousands.  A pair of crossed black ora scimitars hangs from rivets above the entry arch, their edges limned a murderous crimson.  Henbane flourishes in the shadows of the standing stones."
