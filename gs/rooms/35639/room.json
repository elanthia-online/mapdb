      "Drops of water patter into the lush undergrowth encroaching upon the path, its insistent drumbeat an erratic accompaniment to the cries of birds and the screeching of tiny macaques that call the trees their home.  The primates have their pick of residences, from interwoven strangler figs to frankincense trees.  The latter's knobby branches strain to find sunlight not jealously hoarded by taller palms and skyscraping merantis that form much of the dense canopy overhead."
