      "Curving around dunes riddled with sea grass, the pathway leads up a hill toward the walls of Mist Harbor at one end and down to the arched entry of a small harbor.  Tiny buildings evenly spaced upon a single cobbled street are painted with white stucco, which reflects the silvery glow of moonlight.  Unsavory aromas rise from an odd-smelling crooked white shop built into the lee of the pathway."
