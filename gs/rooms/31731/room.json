    "description": [
      "It is apparent upon first glance that it has been many a year since this chapel saw regular use.  Dust adorns every flat surface, from the seats of the many pews to the floor itself and everything in between.  Hymn books are tucked into wooden slots built into the backs of the pews, and while no one resides within the building, the sconces along the walls are lit, topped with fresh candles.  A velvet-draped ebonwood altar sits atop the dais at the head of the aisle with a stained glass window in the background."
