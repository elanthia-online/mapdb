      "The northwesternmost corner of the glade is surrounded on three sides by oak saplings and thick brush.  Further to the north, the forest becomes thicker.  Older, even ancient, trees are visible through the sparse foliage.  A carved granite gravestone rests just before the tree line, a line of short rose bushes planted on each side."
