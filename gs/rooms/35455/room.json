      "Snow lies heavy along a shale-roofed long practice hall of worn stone, its surface broken only by softened footprints and wind-swept drifts.  Stands of fir and ash line either side, their branches creaking faintly in the steady breeze that moves through the corridor.  The path curves gently, threading between shuttered buildings and quieter corners, carrying with it the mingled scent of pine and distant hearth smoke."
