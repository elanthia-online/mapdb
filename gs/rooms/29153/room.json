      "Resting on their sides, a pile of bright green buoys is tied to one of the mooring clamps that trails along the southwestern edge of the long pier.  A single step, deeper than most along the wooden expanse, provides access to a finger pier that sits low in the water and has five docking slips spread out along its length.  White bordered, a freshly painted verdant square is filled with crisp white letters that proclaim \"Pier 3 - Slips 16-20.\""
