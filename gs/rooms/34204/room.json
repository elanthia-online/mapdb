      "Fist-sized nodules of quartz emerging from within the rocky floor break up the prevailing pattern of parallel grooves that extends up the tunnel walls.  The passage slopes unevenly from one side to the other as it winds through the earth.  An occasional hiss sounds from further down the tunnel to the southeast, punctuated by percussive dripping."
