      "Tall pine supports rise up from the water, their lengths ringed with salt stains.  Wrought iron chains creak as the ocean breeze pushes a large cedar sign back and forth.  Bits of wood, plants, and other debris float about the structure, swirling under and around each post.  Chunks of canvas-wrapped cork line each slip, adding protection for docking ships."
