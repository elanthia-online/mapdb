      "Scrambling among the rocks, part way down the sides of the pool, you find dismembered bits of fish and small crabs.  Much of it appears to have been flung here by the retreating waves, but there are also larger pieces that seem out of place.  Looking closer, you realize that not all of them come from sea creatures, for you recognize the carcasses of small land animals as well."
