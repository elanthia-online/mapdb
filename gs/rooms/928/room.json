      "Cool and dry, the tunnel worms its way through the heart of the mountain, the heavy rock insulating its interior and seeming to absorb all sound, except for the low rumble of the unseen river trapped in the depths of the stone.  Even the occasional footfall or the clank of a hard-soled boot on the tunnel floor seem to lose their echo within the all-encompassing rock."
