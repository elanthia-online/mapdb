      "Pushed against the edges of the corridor, the collapsed remains of the ceiling still bears signs of the explosive force used to destroy it.  Small and large chunks of mortar and stone litter a narrow rug that is too dirty and threadbare to reveal its original color.  The waxy remains of a candle lay forgotten upon a nearby cobblestone."
