    "description": [
      "A narrow trail meanders along the base of a bluff.  The granite face is deeply pocked and coated with ice, giving it a sparkling sheen.  In one deep pocket, almost a small grotto, a few hardy ferns and lichens brave the demanding climate, fed by a constant rain of water drops melting from the snow higher up the bluff.  The cottages nestled in the pines along the path bask in the secluded charm."
