      "Three shallow steps descend from the street toward the low doorway of a building, an armor shop if judging by the dark blue banner over the entrance.  The shop's crisply edged stucco walls have been painted steel grey, with white and black spirals accenting the swirls of the mortar.  Sets of armor, most designed to fit a diminutive frame, are on display through the wide bay windows.  A family pauses before the statue of a halfling standing opposite the door as the parents tell the hero's story to their children.",
      "Three shallow steps lead from the street down to a low doorway at the side of a building, apparently the local armor shop.  Its crisply edged stucco walls have been painted steely grey, with faint traces of white and black accenting each swirl of mortar.  Inside a polished bay window are displayed several sets of armor, each designed to fit a diminutive frame.  A family pauses briefly before the statue of a halfling warrior standing opposite the door as the parents tell the hero's story to their children."
