      "Gentle waves rush towards the coastline, the southern tip of a large lagoon visible to the north and northwest.  The moonlight-drenched beaches of the island disappear into a dark jungle-covered hillside, where the silvery glint a large waterfall is barely visible as it cascades into the darkness of the foliage.  Distantly to the east, a well-lit dock with three piers is visible."
