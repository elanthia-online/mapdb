      "Stretching along the shoreline, charcoal grey planks rest on white travertine columns, protecting the habitats below as they connect to a sprawling pier system.  Stone sculptures of sea creatures are half-hidden in the tide pools at the path's northern edge, their surfaces worn smooth from constant contact with the lapping waters.  In the distance, the cliff's green crown of vegetation offers a peaceful, natural backdrop."
