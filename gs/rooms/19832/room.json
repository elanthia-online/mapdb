      "In this amply sized workroom are mingled the chill of stone and the faint but acrid odors of sulfurous potions.  The unadorned walls transition smoothly into a perfect dome, pierced by a large crystalline skylight.  Directly beneath the skylight stands a black basalt workbench, on which rests an array of instruments and artifacts needed by an alchemist."
