      "Wildflowers grow in abundance, blossoming to the water's edge in shocks of intense pink and fuchsia contrasted against dark greenery.  Straggly saplings frame the fog-hazed scene, their leaf-bare branches caught with petite white blooms.  Agitation clouding its churning surface, the brook tumbles over the rapids, jutting rocks and sodden deadfall diverting its course."
