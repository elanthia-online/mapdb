      "Luminous crystals grow along a bend in the cavern wall, dizzying clouds of radiant color drifting through one cluster only to blossom in the next, as if all are working in concert.  The overhanging ceiling juts out over the abominable plaza below, dripping with blobby slime mold that has found purchase in the moisture and heat.  A thin fringe of tufa, not grown tall enough to form true stalagmites, is all that stands between the uneven walkway and a plummet into the depths."
