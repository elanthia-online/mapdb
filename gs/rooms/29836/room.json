      "Golden candlelight warms the darkened interior of this wagon, casting flickering shadows along the tools hanging on the walls and stacks of metal bits stowed haphazardly within.  An oak worktable sits centered within the small open space, its surface meticulously clean in comparison.  A semi-circle of a dozen tall candles ring the backside of the table highlighting a red velvet runner carefully draped across the surface displaying the wares for sale."
