      "Dark and forbidding, a sturdy wooden dock rules over a small bay sheltered by the curve of the isle's coastline.  The pilings are old, their upper halves stained with the droppings of sea birds; the lower encrusted with barnacles.  Deprived the fury of the tides, the waters of the bay lap languorously at the wood."
