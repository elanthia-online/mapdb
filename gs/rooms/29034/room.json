      "Stretching outward to the west, a finger pier with high guardrails supports five docking slips that are evenly spaced and attached to the primary pier with short steps.  Rope is looped about the various support posts to create a simple railing that prevents falls into the deeper waters this far from the shoreline.  A light breeze tugs on a small white sign that reads \"Pier 1 - Slips 16-20\" from its hanging position in the middle of the rope railing."
