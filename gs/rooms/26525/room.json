      "The smooth, unevenly spaced driftwood that comprise the walls of this poorly constructed shack give evidence in both sight and smell of ages spent in or near the swelling sea; indeed, bits of sand and dried muck cling desperately to the occasional dent in the wood of several of the logs.  Through gaps in the walls, you hear waves crashing eternally in rhythm with the unabating buzzing of big bugs.  The ground below is formed of a mixture of crushed seashells, sand, and other unidentifable substances."
