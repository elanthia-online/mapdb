      "Paths converge on this solid, dry patch of ground from each of the four corners, bringing with them green and indigo grasses, amber weeds, and lavender underbrush that climb the shallow hill to meet an ancient stone well bathed in the shifting hues shed by the inconstant sky above.  It has no roof nor bucket for pulling water, but stones at each of the cardinal points in its construction bear sigils of spiraled lines and curling branches accented, rather than hidden, by a veneer of multihued mosses."
