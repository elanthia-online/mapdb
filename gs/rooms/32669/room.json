      "The center of this room is filled by a large slab of intricately carved stone that serves as a desk.  Smooth rolaren and invar runes have been meticulously inlaid upon its surface detailing the history of past campaigns.  Behind the desk, three towering ebonwood chairs rest on a slightly elevated base, commanding the chamber.  The wall behind the desk presents a striking display of weapons and armors that have been carefully maintained in battle-ready condition."
