      "The shop's interior is plastered with loud and garish wallpaper in alternating stripes of banana yellow and pumpkin orange, blessedly hidden for the most part behind large posters boasting feats of wonder, both hilarious and grotesque.  Along the back wall is a short counter topped with candy jars and flower vases, while a brightly painted shelf hangs above it.  A fanned card rack sits front and center on a white-clothed table in the middle of the area."
