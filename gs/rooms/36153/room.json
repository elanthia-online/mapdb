      "A single glaesine sconce attached to the wall illuminates the small chamber, casting a fitfully flickering light across the room's few features.  Smooth, dark-veined granite walls rise into the shadowed darkness.  Dangling from a chain at one side of the room is a small mithglin ring.  At the far end of the chamber is a simple curtained opening."
