      "Evenly spaced across the room, hoops of iron are hammered into the walls, each with a set of leather reins looped through them.  A large square bench rests near the northwestern wall, a small leather cushion placed upon it, with a set of boot brushes nearby.  Wooden crates filled with an assortment of nightmarish snacks are set upon counter-topped cupboards that line the eastern walls."
