    "description": [
      "Far from the open air and the activity of the other decks, the hold is dark and echoes with a symphony of creaking timbers and dripping water.  Though a skim of water lingers over the swollen planks of the deck, most of the cargo, a collection of crates, barrels, and foot lockers in a variety of makes, remains dry and secured by lengths of line.  A single sea lamp swings from a rusted iron chain overhead, throwing fitful light over the cavernous space."
