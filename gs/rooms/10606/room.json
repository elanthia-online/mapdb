      "Several large trees have been cut down here and only their stumps remain.  The flat of one stump has a silver crescent moon painted upon it, another has been painted totally black.  Stuck into a hole in the middle of another stump is strange figure made of sticks tied together with thick leather straps.  A light breeze blows through the area, disturbing the leaves and debris on the ground."
