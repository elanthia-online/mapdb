      "With much of the exterior structure partially buried in the ground, the cracked stone walls of this edifice are covered in a mixture of clinging dampness and dirt that stain them a murky brown.  Guttering candles, their flames a livid green, are scattered around a cracked stone altar and the armor stand next to it, the eerie light glinting off the items arrayed on top of them.  The air is stuffy and still, the accumulated dirt and mold creating a musty smell that clings to everything."
