      "Only a narrow rim of traversable ground surrounds a massive underground lake of algae-blanketed, foul-smelling water.  Wide natural openings in the domed ceiling above permit the warm rays of the sun to permeate the shallow water.  White, yellow, and red crystals have formed a thick crust of mineralized rings around the circumfrence of the pool."
