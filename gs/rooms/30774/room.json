      "Aligned directly across from an invar-framed picture window, an enormous four-poster feather bed is grazed with hints of moonlight that drift in through the wide glass panes.  Suspended from the ceiling, a six-tiered rainbow glaes chandelier casts kaleidoscopic colors across the fiery crimson damask bedding that is piled with satin cushions and thick furs.  Obscured on a far wall, a set of obsidian-inlaid stairs is fixed next to a roll-top carved mahogany desk.",
