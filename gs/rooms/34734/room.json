      "Two temples, alike in their black stone construction, stand opposite one another at a bend in the road shaded by immense yew trees.  One shrine is a stygian marble building beyond a metallic wall of interlocking hexagons.  Spidersilk threads stretch across the openings in the metal, glistening like spun silver, and an octet of garnet eyes is inlaid into the lintel over the gate.  The arch leading to the second, a smaller, blocky building, is adorned with a bleached skull with a crack down the center."
