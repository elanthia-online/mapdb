      "The greatroom boasts square mahogany paneling that climbs gracefully to hand-hewn beams pegged with thick treenails.  At the center of the room, a variety of trophies surmount a mantel, three thickly tufted couches arcing about its carved granite fireplace.  A burnished brass and oak sideboard stretches along the rear wall beneath arched windows with leaded diamond panes that suffuse the room with sunlight.  The hallway to the west terminates in a pile of rubble."
