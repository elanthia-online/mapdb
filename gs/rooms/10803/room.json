      "Intertwined creepers and vine-like tendrils blanket the path, growing with wild abandon and enveloping the few remaining pale cobblestones.  Local tree bark has been infested with a combination of pale lichens and woolly moss, lending the old trunks a patched and mottled appearance.  Leaves rustle slightly in the breeze, their voices the sound of raspy whispers.",
