      "Redolent of hay and horses, the stables are clean and well-tended.  Grooms and stable boys move about the numerous stalls, their efforts acknowledged by contented whickers echoing almost conversationally.  At one end twin destriers stand in adjacent stalls, their eyes bright and ears flicking alertly as they stamp to and fro, anxious to greet their riders.  Caparisoned barding of black, ruby, and silver is laid out on a stand next to each steed, along with a monogrammed leather saddle."
