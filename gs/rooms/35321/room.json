      "Polished white marble floors reflect the lights of pendant lanterns anchored to the ceiling, the combination of reflected light and soft glow from recessed windows above effectively illuminating the space.  Arched wooden counters crafted from ancient, dusky haon line one side, each adorned with delicate silver inlays depicting various elven city-states.  Painted within panels upon the surrounding walls, a variety of murals offer bright splashes of color against the austerity of the surrounding marble."
