      "At the wood's edge, a gnarled stump hunkers between the other towering trees, shorn off as if felled by a wicked storm.  Its bark and open-faced wood is charred as if by lighting, and the twisting of its break suggests high wind.  Even so, it has found new life as a jagged altar of sorts -- myriad pillar candles stand in a crescent on its shorn brow, and wax has pooled and spread across its face, offerings of flowers and small tokens trapped in its cooled flows."
