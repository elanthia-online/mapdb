    "description": [
      "Two immense fangs of stone bear down upon a wide aperture in the southern wall, permitting a dizzying view of the land below, from the green-tufted tops of weeping willows and cypresses to the bustling streets of the village beyond.  Only the spire at the center of town stands taller.  Despite the wind swirling through the opening, the air holds intense, prickling heat, its obvious source the emerald firelight crackling from archways to the northwest and northeast."
