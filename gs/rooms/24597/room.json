      "Warmly lit by crystal lamps, the airy pavilion is filled with vibrant colors.  Rugs scattered over the ground are woven with jade, teal, and sapphire hues in elaborate knotwork designs.  A carved rosewood rack filled with instruments stands to one side.  Polished to a high sheen, a table ornately carved with flowering vines is centered on the carpets as a focal point in the large space."
