      "Stylized green grass lines the canvas's bottom, carrying halfway up the interior, after which the color changes to a vivid sky blue.  Across the canvas, grey-painted mountains rise above the grass and are crossed with painted niveous white clouds.  Atop these peaks are halflings posing, proudly holding billowing flags.  In the room's center, placed on the dirt floor, a sky blue wooden table is laden with carved stone game pieces.  Across from the table, a small wooden rack is placed."
