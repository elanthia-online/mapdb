      "Rectangular reed baskets brim with roots, mushrooms, and bundles of greens, their earthy and herbaceous fragrances permeating the air.  Piled with diced vegetables, a chopping board rests on the birch counter set between a potbelly stove and a scattering of elm tables.  Assorted herbs dry overhead, strung from a crossbeam that spans from above the open doorway to over the framed watercolor decorating the opposite wall."
