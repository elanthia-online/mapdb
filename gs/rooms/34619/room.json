    "description": [
      "Paint in autumnal hues cavorts along the dark slate walls, illuminating the etched forms of prowling cats.  They congregate to either side of a high gate of black steel with golden ornamentation.  Low stone buildings with dark windows huddle to either side of the street, casting long shadows over the paving stones.  The road splits into three wide lanes that proceed southward, the southeastern fork descending toward a bustling bazaar flourishing beneath the eastern wall."
