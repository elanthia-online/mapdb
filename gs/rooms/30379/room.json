      "Silvery moonlight reflects off the enormous spires of shiny black rock thrust through the ocean's surface to dominate the horizon in the north, east, and south.  Waves crash against the rocks in the distance, throwing water high into the air and causing swells of ocean to come rippling back.  Rough water makes navigation a bit difficult due to the swells cresting in cascades of frothing spray.  Further passage in any direction but east is impossible due to the rocky barricades."
