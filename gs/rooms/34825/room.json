      "Creeping shadows smother the glow of iron lanterns chained to the central ceiling beam, the faint illumination skimming the dust settled over every surface.  A tamped earth floor, scattered with moldy hay, splits the two rows of decaying stalls and leads to the back door.  Only remnants of metal bars remain on the stall doors, leaving jagged teeth to frame the windows, blazing orange with the consuming rust."
