      "A ruby-toned velvet runner protects the polished dark glaes hallway that transitions into a narrow stairway outfitted with an elaborately silverworked banister.  The steep ascension ends at a well-appointed landing decorated with some blooming bright sanguine geraniums in squared terracotta planters that frame an oversized ebony doorway."
