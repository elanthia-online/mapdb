      "Shaped from shining white marble veined by streams of vibrant gold, tremendous fluted columns rise from the floor to support the second-story arched ceiling.  Punctuating the march of the columns are muscled figures of stone and suits of burnished armor.  The plush runners underfoot flow like crimson rivers, sheathing the cold marble of the floor.  Arches to the west and east lead to the citadel's barracks, while a set of doors opens onto the courtyard."
