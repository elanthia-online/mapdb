      "Stepping down the flight of stairs, a cold iron-barred cell contains a small threadbare cot, while a pair of dark iron rings set into the floor and two within the ceiling and a small rack are all that remain inside.  A long broom lays on the floor outside the bars near a large wooden lever that appears to control the cell door."
