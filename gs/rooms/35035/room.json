      "Shimmers of heat warp the air over a smoking crater brimming with roiling lava.  Gases and smoke pour off of the surface in choking billows heavy-laden with gritty ash.  Cajoled by the hot winds screaming over the flats, the smoke twists and twitches into strange, ominous shapes as it drifts skyward."
