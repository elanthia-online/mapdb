      "On opposing sides of a dirt racing track, a set of crimson-painted steps and a set of green-painted steps lead to corresponding banner-draped viewing stands filled with raucous crowds.  The soft ground has been trampled by foot and hoof alike, a thrown silver horseshoe stuck in a water-lined mud puddle near a shorn tuft of sweet grass.  A thicket of beautyberry bushes provide a scenic background for a collection of booths."
