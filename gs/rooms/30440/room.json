      "Strands of uprooted seaweed, smooth pebbles, thin twigs, shells void of their natural inhabitants -- in short organic flotsam and jetsam churned up from the sea floor -- cycle hurriedly toward the white-capped waters of a powerful whirlpool to the east.  A combination of pristine clarity and muddied murk marks the water in an incongruous pattern of light and dark."
