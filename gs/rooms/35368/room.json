      "Blackened iron latticework stretches across the ceiling, descending in filigreed designs to mark the confines of individual stalls built into the walls of the stable.  Windows high above keep air flowing through the structure, which is cool despite the humidity outside.  Rain barrels are arranged within the center of the corridor, their tops covered in mesh to keep unwanted pests at bay."
