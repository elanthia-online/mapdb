      "This area of the workshop is clearly intended for alchemical research.  Everywhere you look there are beakers and globes of various colored liquid.  The air has a heaviness to it, and the combination of scents in the area are nearly overpowering.  An elaborate cupboard dominates one wall, replete with tiny cubbies, each of which is filled with a different small vial.  Skins filled with liquid hang from pegs on the other wall, each one labeled in a cramped, hard to read script.",
      "This area of the workshop holds a plethora of alchemical research, the beakers and globes interspersed with wooden table legs and rusty horseshoes.  Overpowering scents hang heavily in air, casting a faint haze across the tiny toy-filled cubbies within the chalk-covered cupboard dominating the far wall.  Splatters of unknown origin litter the stone floor, and a small porcelain tea set sits centered within a circle of liquid."
