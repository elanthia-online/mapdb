      "A few smooth stalagmites are carved with a spiraling pattern of small niches.  Tiny potted toadstools rest within the little shelters crafted for them, lending their pale blue luminescence to the overall ambience of the cavern.  Neatly lined up against the eastern wall is a carved stone desk, complete with inkwell and quills."
