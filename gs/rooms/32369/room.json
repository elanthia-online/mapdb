      "Niches in the walls house candles that gently flicker, radiating a warm glow that barely penetrates the heavy shadows lurking about the manor.  A woven rug embroidered with complex knotwork in varying shades of blue covers the floor, and a double staircase leads up to a darkened landing.  In the middle of the room, towering nearly one story tall, is an engraved crystal tablet."
