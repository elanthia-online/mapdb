      "Two-person benches situated equidistant from each other to form half-circle rows begin at a long mahogany table and expand outward from one end of the hall to the other, leaving only a tiny standing area for late arrivals.  Gold-trimmed mahogany buckets hang from each bench's armrest, and overly stuffed cushions line each seat to provide substantial comfort during long sessions.  Standing behind a mahogany podium, an auctioneer keeps watch over the area with a keen eye."
