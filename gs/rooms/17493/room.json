      "An enormous boulder bearing an uncanny resemblance to a frog wearing a hat sits off the side of the road.  The rock is completely coated in a slimy green fungus.  Gooseberries line up along the edge of the hard dirt-packed road, and numerous yellow and red berries have been trampled into the ground."
