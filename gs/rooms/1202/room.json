    "description": [
      "A few scruffy bushes cling to the hillside here upslope of the trail.  Downslope, to the southeast, you see only a few clumps of tough, brown grass clinging wherever a pocket of soil has collected on the rocky slope.  Dirty white lichen grows in lacy patterns across the surface of the rocks, its delicacy contrasting with the dull, blunt stone."
