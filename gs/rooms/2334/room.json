    "description": [
      "Carved into the blue-white ice of the glacier, the temple reflects the best of halfling craftsmanship and design.  Nineteen columns line each side of the foyer, creating a sense of vast distance between the entrance and the nave to the east.  A central ambulatory paved with grey slate leads between the columns past the thirty-six bays, each of which is marked with the symbol of a god or goddess.  Some of the bays contain small kiosks where merchants hawk religious wares."
