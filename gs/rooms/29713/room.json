      "The thick woven wools suspended from the ironwood frame fray slightly across the fur-lined rugs covering the dirt beneath the shop, whipping wildly as the wind stirs the room.  Steel-forged lanterns cast sharp, disjointed patterns across the body of a red-streaked marble statue, the scent of soil and sweat intermingling with the remnants of smoldering incense that litter the statue's feet.  Sketches of unknown adventurers are affixed across the surface of the recess, intermingled with stubs of long burned out candles.",
      "The pastel silks suspending from the bamboo frame fray slightly across the speckled taupe rugs covering the dirt beneath the shop, whipping wildly as the wind stirs the room.  Steel-forged lanterns cast sharp, disjointed patterns across the body of a red-streaked marble statue, the scent of heated metal intermingling with the remnants of smoldering incense that litter the statue's feet.  Unintelligible markings and punctures mar the surface of the recess, the marks covered by hand-smeared clumps of ash."
