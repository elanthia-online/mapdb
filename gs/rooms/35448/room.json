      "A stone platform justs out like a pier over a lake of molton red lava, fed by the many tubes that flow down the rocky walls.  Crude images have been carved into the walls of the volcano, representing fiery beasts and hideous creatures.  An uneven steel staircase has been constructed along one side.  Its steps are crooked and tilted, but the bolts that secure it to the wall seem strong enough."
