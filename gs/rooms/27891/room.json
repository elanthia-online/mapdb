      "Ribbed black willow walls rise from a speckled black marble floor.  Just above a handblown double-heart bottle hangs a pearl-handled filigreed mandolin, and an ebonwood beam ceiling completes the picture.  A jewel-inlaid caddy and an oval-shaped speckled marble counter stand side by side in the middle of the room."
