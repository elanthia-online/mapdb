      "Suspended from a golden chain, an enormous crystal and votive-filled chandelier hangs over a central hug and table, providing ample illumination for the circular vestibule.  Golden linden planks mix with ebonwood to create a striped paneling along the lower half of the surrounding walls, while the tops are covered in painted silk to create a colorful mural.  A flight of mahogany stairs leads to the level above, while a heavy golden linden door is open in the eastern wall and a narrow hallway provides access to a sprawling kitchen."
