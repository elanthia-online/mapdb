      "Moonlight from a large, multi-paned window brings out the luster of the pine-paneled walls.  The window offers an expansive view of the forest, the conifers with their heavy mantles of snow standing on the ridges and inclines like so many soldiers at attention.  The bedroom is cheerful, sporting crisp gingham curtains, oak furnishings and a bounty of moonlight."
