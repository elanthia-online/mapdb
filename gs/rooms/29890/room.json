      "A cruel, driving gale blows in from across the river, scattering the mist enough to provide clear view of the unending ice flats beyond.  The strength of the wind appears to have been enough to drive the trees back from the river bank, leaving only barren earth to greet the water.  Trees close to the banks are stunted, their growth warped by battering from the elements."
