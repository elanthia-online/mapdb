      "Jagged shale rocks jut up from the sandy floor and create an uneven terrain to traverse, which is odd in this small space that is surrounded by thick canvas walls.  Bowls of oil and fire illuminate everything in sight, including the half-desiccated carcass of some forgotten sea creature near the eastern edge of the pavilion.  A large flat-topped boulder blocks the path between the western and southwestern egresses."
