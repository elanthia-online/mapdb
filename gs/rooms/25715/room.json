    "description": [
      "Crawling wisteria vines cling to the side of the villa and twine their way about the white banisters and railings that line the balcony.  Recessed into the verdant and violet foliage, a wooden bench is supported by wrought iron posts designed in the shape of enormous frogs, and is flanked by a pair of black iron filigree tables.  Glass-paned doors lead into the villa, while a spiraling wooden staircase leads into the garden below."
