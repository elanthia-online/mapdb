      "Under starlight, shadows play within an ancient Ornathian maple, causing smoky bands of silvery light to tickle the wild foliage that decorates the ground.  The red marl and travertine pavers of the avenue fade into the rocky terrain around a massive marble temple.  Marble pillars gleam softly, reflecting the moonlight, while the opening in the domed roof frames the night sky, adding a touch of tranquility to the sacred and serene space."
