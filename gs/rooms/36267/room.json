      "Fitted into a curved bronze framework, panels of glass line the outer wall of the workshop, their surfaces etched with protective runes that shimmer faintly in the light cast by suspended glimaerstone orbs.  A tall gnomish-crafted workbench dominates the center of the space.  Crystalline tubing snakes along the ceiling, carrying a faint azure glow from deeper in the ship, and hanging plants trail verdant tendrils from the tubing overhead.  A pile of jade-hued silk cushions  sits between the outer wall and a built-in verdigris copper brazier."
