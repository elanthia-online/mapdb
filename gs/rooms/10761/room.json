      "Encircling the the whole of the guildhall entry, this wide gallery is bounded by pale granite walls and a richly carved oak balustrade, which forms an elongated oval flowing up from a sweeping staircase.  Sunlight filtered through tall, lancet-topped leaded glass windows illumines four magnificent paintings, two flanking a pair of wide doors on the south side, and the other two placed symmetrically on the north side, framing a wide archway leading north.",
