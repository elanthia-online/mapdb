      "The sound of blades violently whipping through the air fills your ears.  As you move a bit further, the fog churning around you parts, and you see an unusual type of cell before you.  Scimitars whirl through the air of their own volition, holding a roughly circular pattern.  Inside the cell sits an old Krolvin warlord missing a few chunks of flesh, probably from attempted escapes."
