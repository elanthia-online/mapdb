      "Smoking lanterns hang from hooks in the ceiling, their glass faces stained with soot and grim.  Separations in the clapboard walls allow the winds from the nearby coastline to sweep sand into the cramped hallway, creating a heavy patina of dust and grit that touches every surface.  Squinting through the bars of a small collections booth, a clerk decorated in spectacles watches the hallway with interest."
