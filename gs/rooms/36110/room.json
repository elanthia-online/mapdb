      "A large circle drawn upon the floor occupies most of this room.  It appears that the circle is drawn with a mixture of chalk and salt.  There are five red candles at equal distances around the circle, and lines of dried blood drawn on the floor connect the candles, forming a star within the circle.  Along the far wall of the room is a canopied bed covered with black silk sheets."
