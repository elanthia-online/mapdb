    "description": [
      "The arched walkway spanning the distance between the Bard Guild and the Jastev Amphitheater is shielded by heavily carved wooden screens along its entire length.  The workmanship exhibited on the screens is masterful, depicting a series of scenes from well-known plays and musical performances.  Through the cavities, the gentle touch of a breeze enters, keeping the elevated walkway a comfortable promenade."
