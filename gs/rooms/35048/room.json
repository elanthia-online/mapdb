      "An off-key song with off-color lyrics brays from the torchlit windows of a long, one-storied inn sheltering beneath a crooked larch.  Needles, green and brown, blanket the flagstone road leading up to its entrance, where a one-eyed bouncer with a cudgel sorts customers from potential nuisances.  The roof of scale-shaped pine shingles is sealed with acrid tar."
