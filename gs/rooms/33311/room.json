      "Once-beautiful scarlet and black scarves with gold accents suspended from the ceiling have begun to deteriorate and fall apart.  What was once a series of luxurious pillows now lay scattered along the floor, their bright coloring and intricate designs faded long ago.  Tiny shafts of light pour in from cracks throughout the walls as dust gathers in their wooden crevices.  Nearby, a long wooden shelf lines a moisture-stained wall, while a yellowed sheaf of paper is tacked next to it."
