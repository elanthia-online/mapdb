      "In desperate need of repair, this modest, one-room cottage appears to have all of a home's amenities in a single area.  Food preparation and storage is on one side of the room, indicated by the iron hearth and porcelain basin, while a cedar bed and matching chest of drawers occupies the other and is suggestive of the sleeping area.  To the side of a cracked window and below a wooden sign is a dangling shelf, broken glass and tiny labels strewn along the floor."
