      "Twin rings of pearl inlaid in the dark stone floor encircle a glowing column of amber energy peppered with tiny silver flecks.  Shimmering as it twirls back upon itself, a crimson portal leads beyond.  Each wall is etched with a detailed rendition of a different demon, their appearances almost too realistic."
