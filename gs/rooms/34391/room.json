    "description": [
      "The pond is nestled in the center of a ring-shaped building, a sturdy pine door leading back inside.  Sunlight reflects and refracts across the thick layer of ice that covers most of the pond's surface, causing a dazzling diamond effect.  A multitude of razor-thin grooves mar the surface of the ice, and the pond is surrounded by heaping snowdrifts, nearly concealing a worn grey beechwood log and an empty winterberry ale barrel that rests nearby.  A cleared path leads to a small fishing dock on the southern side of the pond."
