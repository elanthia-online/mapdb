    "description": [
      "Three concave walls enclose this large, triangular room.  Leaded crystal windows form the points of the triangle, filtering in a dim grey light.  In the center of the room, the floor is stepped downward, forming an amphitheater with a long dark platform at the fore.  A pair of jet double doors in the south wall and a panel that rests slightly ajar in the north comprise the only breaks in the smooth dark walls, their surfaces faintly etched with stark blocky designs.  The air is perfectly still and carries a faint musky tang."
