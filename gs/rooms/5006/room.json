      "A wide trail winds eastward between the trees, zigzagging up a steep slope that rises out of the forest to a grassy plateau.  Thick patches of fiddlehead ferns thrive beneath the spreading branches of the older maples and oaks, competing with saplings born of falling seeds and acorns for the space between the roots.",
