      "Rows of training dummies stand in the dirt yard, their burlap bodies stuffed with straw.  One dummy is painted with a crude silver-edged black sword symbol on its chest and has an especially lopsided face.  The barracks, a large grey stone building with a sloping slate roof and evenly spaced square windows, has wings that frame the yard on three sides.  A black steel gate to the south allows egress to the row."
