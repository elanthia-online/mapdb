      "A stylized claw in gilt adorns the arched spruce door that is the primary means of egress from the room.  The hearth opposite the window is framed in rough-hewn stone that is flecked with glimmers of pyrite and looks to provide ample warmth should the bed, with its high-piled fur blankets, fail to do so.  A stuffed lynx stands by the window, amber eyes narrowed as if carefully keeping watch."
