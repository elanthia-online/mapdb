      "Rushing seawater races toward the edge of the stone disc, where it careens down toward the unnatural path below in frothing white falls that could rival thunder for intensity.  The edge of the vast monument is jagged and uneven, eaten at by the sea where it was not buffeted by the ocean's sudden retreat.  Pits in the rock hold deep pools teeming with sealife, from dazzling fish to bright-hued anemones stretching their tendrils as if trying to hoard the remaining saltwater around them."
