      "Metal-framed sketchings are artfully arranged along the haon-planked walls of the shop, each depicting a silhouette draped in a hand-drawn gown of charcoal and watercolors.  A velvet-padded rack wrought into a trellis of metal roses stands opposite of a vase-framed ebonwood counter, the displays both wrapped in tendrils of faenor-forged ivy.  A trio of wire-framed mannequins stand posed alongside each wall, each figure grasping a bouquet of dried flora."
