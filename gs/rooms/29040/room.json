      "Not much more than a basket at the top of the main mast, a small opening in the railing gives way to a rope ladder leading to the deck below.  Crudely carved images deface the wooden surfaces of the nest, the most prominent a tentacled octopus that appears to be clinging to the top of the mast.  The remains of a tattered flag holding on by one corner flutters in the breeze."
