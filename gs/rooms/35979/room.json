      "Marking the pathway at the transition point where the savanna enclosures and rocky northern habitats of the wild cats and bears meet, the area is dominated on the south by burnished grasses and to the north by verdant bushes and towering pines.  A wide-canopied acacia spreads its shade upon the grasslands on one side, while blending with the spindled and curving conifers on the other.  Benches surround a small outcropping where a freckled half-elf vendor hawks her wares from a semi-circular bar."
