    "description": [
      "Long tree branches bend and extend across the trail from both sides, a moderately protective canopy from recurring rainstorms.  Cut, debarked logs are evenly spaced in a line along the more lofty sections of the trail, allowing for valuable footing on an otherwise slippery slope.  A tremendous boom of thunder followed by a distant flash of light and the crackling of a tree branch ripping away from its birthplace is commonplace."
