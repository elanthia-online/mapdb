    "description": [
      "Dolphins painstakingly awakened from dark rock flank the entrance to a blue seastone shrine at the end of the winding road.  Iseya lichen has found purchase between the stones of the walls, the sharp silvers and teals of the flora brighter than the muted blue of the seastone.  A few half-spent tallow candles sit to either side of the entrance, their blackened wicks sodden from the sea air."
