      "Multihued minerals paint the surrounding rock walls in shades of green, yellow, and white.  Colorful crystals, only a few inches high, cling to the stone floor and attempt the mighty climb toward the ceiling.  Skittering noises and the clacking of claws filter in from a deeper part of the tunnel."
