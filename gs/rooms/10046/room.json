      "Silvery mist seeps through jagged cracks in the blackened ground, collecting in swirls and eddies that glide over and around the rough scrub and broken stones that dot the moor.  Several jet-black crows perch in a skeletal tree in the distance, fluffing their inky feathers against the cold wind as they impassively watch their surroundings."
