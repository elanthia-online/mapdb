      "Pale mistwood paneling encloses the room, with a thin wash of silver lending a faint sheen.  A detailed circle of runes dominates the center of the floor, worked in pearlescent white tile amongst the greater pattern of azure waveform shapes.  Tightly rolled sheaves of paper peek out from small niches in the numerous scroll racks that line the walls."
