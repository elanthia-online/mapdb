      "The broad sweep of the wooden floor is interrupted by a worn rug.  Halfway to the wooden ceiling, a tattered merchant permit hangs on one of the plain wooden walls.  An oval-shaped speckled marble counter and an ornate black marble vault carved with bas-relief battle scenes are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
