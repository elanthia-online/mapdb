      "Near a domed dwelling at the avenue's eastern edge stands an elegant statue of dusky golden marble.  The monument is carved into the shape of a hunting caracal, its artistry capturing in lifelike detail the predatory grace of the feline's tensed musculature.  From the south wafts alder smoke in puffy white clouds, the earthy sweetness mostly masking an unpleasant, sharp melange that it accompanies."
