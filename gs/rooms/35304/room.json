      "Smooth marble walls and vaulted ceilings create a crisp, professional setting in the debt collection office.  A one-eared Torren debt collector, dressed in garish pickle green robes, sits behind a desk of polished mahogany, its edges adorned with subtle carvings of scrollwork and stork feathers.  Behind the desk, a mural depicting the Tower of the Sea Princess sprawls across the wall.  A large brass inkwell shaped like a ship's anchor sits on the desk, while a copper hourglass filled with blue sand rests on a nearby shelf."
