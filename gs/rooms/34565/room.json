      "Mismatched, tarnished brass lanterns cast a glow over a cracked glass display case set before a crudely painted mural depicting something that vaguely resembles a city of crooked buildings speckled with dull, poorly cut gems.  Empty hangers, wrought in monstrously misshapen forms, dot the walls between vases filled with rudimentary origami florals.  A translucent blue stain mottles the wood floor, the imitation water dappled with white triangles attached to bowl-like brown shapes."
