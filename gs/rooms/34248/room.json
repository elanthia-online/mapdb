      "Spars of gemstone in a variety of colors jab up from the floor of the cavern, flanking the eastern side of the bridge in a multihued vanguard.  The bridge's peculiar stone is carpeted in a fleshy layer of secretions, muddy in hue but streaked through with yellows and repulsive reds.  Blobby growths like tumors blot the surface, and some dangle hideously over the side, swinging in the moist air."
