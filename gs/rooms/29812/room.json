      "The haphazardly nailed closet is both narrow, yet oddly spacious.  An oversized steel birdcage stands guard over a number of rolled up maps, the scrawled renderings of mysterious locales laid bare between stains of ale and saltwater.  A torn hemp net decorates the back wall, dangling random props that sway with every movement of the wagon."
