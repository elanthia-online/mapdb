      "Tapered green branches, many with their leaves still attached, are woven together with vines to form a rustic arbor. The structure is tucked between two giant roots of an ancient redwood, narrowing as it stretches back toward a curtain of hanging moss that obscures the secrets of the tree's deeper embrace.  In front of the living drape stands a naturally finish oiled zebrawood tray.  Two more displays are closer to the front and equally offset to either side, a single piece cocobolo log pedestal and cocobolo log stand completing a triangle with a pyrographed cedar sign at the center.",
