      "A narrow dirt track runs north to south, linking the northwest and southwest rays, its surface worn smooth by steady passage.  Faint animal calls drift from both directions, mixing with the rustle of wind through the trees.  To the east, marble steps ascend toward the colonnade, their edges softened by years of use.  Opposite, a heavy iron gate stands closed, marking the entrance to the Trans-Island Road, where blended brick, travertine, and marl form a well-trodden path stretching toward distant farmlands."
