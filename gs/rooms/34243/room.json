      "A spectacular mushroom grows from a cleft in the cavern floor near the terrace, its cap a confusing whorl of colors that look as if a crazed painter swirled disparate pigments together in a fit of madness.  Spores fall in a pale cloud from the bone white gills on the underside of the cap, glittering like motes of ethereal starlight in the ebbs and flows of the cavern's radiance.  Beneath the giant, the cave floor sports clusters of new fungal buds, all laden with the same uncanny hues."
