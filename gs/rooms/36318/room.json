      "Sunlight filters through the heavy, leaded crystal windows that span floor to ceiling on the port and starboard sides.  A gold-accented mahogany counter sits in the center of the dark green marble floor.  To the north, music echoes from the ballroom, while a tapestry-lined hallway leads toward the buffet and a silver-inlaid mahogany archway leads toward the casino floor."
