      "A floor of dark grey marble tiles streaked with lighter swirls echoes your footsteps in this dim hallway.  Several paintings adorn the walls, each lit by a soft glow whose source you cannot determine.  While all the art is of the highest caliber, one of the largest, a rendering of an intricate hedge maze, looks so lifelike that you can almost see people running amongst its verdant walls."
