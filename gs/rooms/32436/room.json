      "Flapping like thunder in the cold wind, an abundance of bright crimson banners enliven the austere courtyard.  Black cobblestones ripple out from a central statue in concentric circles, stretching out toward gated homes whose rolling lots stretch out toward the city's western wall.  One manor, closer than the rest, is the very picture of genteel decay behind a wrought iron gate secured by a heavy padlock."
