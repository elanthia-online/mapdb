      "Colorful awnings in teal, gold, and copper stretch across the grassy field and are held aloft by tall poles wrapped in burgundy and mustard yellow ribbons.  Laughter trickles in from other sections of the field where guests play games of darts in hopes of winning tickets for the various prizes found throughout the fairgrounds.  Beyond the shelter of the awnings, luminaries decorate the trees and bushes, their bright glow making the foliage seem deeper and darker."
