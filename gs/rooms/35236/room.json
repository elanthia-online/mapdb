      "Moving away from the boardwalk is a sheltered area flanked by slick boulders and large hunks of driftwood.  The sand slopes gently down toward a dark shore littered with the outline of rocks, more driftwood, and other debris.  In the middle of this slope, centered on a flat patch of cleared dirt, is a wide wooden bench carved with a six-tentacled octopus that looks over a rocky stretch of shore.  Centered above the bench is a metal lantern atop a driftwood pillar.  In the distance, the calls of birds and other wildlife mingle with the sound of waves."
