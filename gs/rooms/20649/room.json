      "Tacked to the walls are a variety of local animal hides interspersed with several wrought iron hooks.  The acridity of tanning agents assaults the sense and is only mildly relieved by a pair of open windows.  Giant luminescent toadstools shed a bright white light, providing more than adequate illumination for guild members to practice their craft in this spacious workshop."
