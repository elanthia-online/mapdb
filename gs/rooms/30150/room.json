      "Hewn from the bedrock of the Ravelin plateau, this chamber sparkles with various gems and geodes within the stone walls.  The eastern wall of the cavern is simply missing, replaced by a magical barrier holding back the raging waters of the Mistydeep beyond and providing a unique glimpse of life beneath the river's surface.  A bluish white vein of unmined vaalorn meanders around a small pool and across the floor, ending at a natural rock shelf below several niches perfect for holding small ingredients.",

The eastern wall of the cavern is simply missing, replaced by a magical barrier holding back the raging waters of the Mistydeep beyond and allowing the ghostly light of bioluminescent plant life beneath the river's surface to flood the cavern.  A bluish white vein of unmined vaalorn meanders around a small pool and across the floor, ending at a natural rock shelf."
