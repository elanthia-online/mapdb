    "description": [
      "A crevice a hundred feet wide blocks passage along the plateau's edge to the east.  Several hundred feet below, a torrent of water gushes out of the crevice in a spectacular waterfall, crashing down to the hills below and winding away to the southeast.  The plateau is arid and inhospitable, indicating that rainfall is a rare occurrence, yet the sheer amount of water suggests a voluminous source.  The only travel options available are to follow the crevice to the north or the plateau's edge to the west."
