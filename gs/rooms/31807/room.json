    "description": [
      "Gilt-foiled wrens soar across the shredded emerald-colored ceiling, their diminutive bodies visible between the dozens of wind chimes strung from the iron staircase to the back wall, with the hollow tones of metal and wood echoing in the small chamber.  A pillow-covered bed sits nestled below a long ebonwood shelf, the ledge perched with a single hollow-eyed doll, its arms broken off and sitting upon the woolen blanket.  A faint glow of crimson emanates from beneath the wooden bed, pulsating slightly."
