      "Planks of sun-bleached wood have been reinforced by iron rivets, the disorganized shop resembling the interior of a ramshackle ship.  Faded flags of unknown origin are draped against the walls, providing a backdrop for a cluttered stained wood wardrobe and a heavily notched wooden chest firmly wedged towards the back.  A chum bucket sits empty in the back corner, save for a bright yellow pineapple."
