    "description": [
      "Numerous stumps dot the hilltop's landscape, though they are surrounded by not only full-grown trees, but also by a handful of saplings.  Mounds of timber, covered by black canvas and held by chains, are stockpiled in several spots.  Runways outlined with white paint are visible through the trees further up.  To one side, the edge of the tree growth ends abruptly at the edge of a deep chasm.  Logs arranged in a pyramid-like fashion rest on the other side of the gorge."
