      "Beneath heavily curtained windows, a writing desk is scattered with letters.  Atop it, a heavy brass stamp lies on its side, still caked with grey-swirled crimson wax.  Candles burn in nooks and in several clusters on the stone floor but not in sufficient numbers to raise the illumination beyond a wavering golden glow."
