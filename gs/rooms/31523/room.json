      "Dark red oak lines the walls with irregular panels, the thick grain of the wood contrasting against a rich wool carpet lining the floor.  Centered against the far wall is a huge walnut sleighbed that is flanked by a pair of modwir tables.  Resting in front of a small riverstone fireplace is a pair of cushioned chairs, a brushed copper bin of sticks tucked to one side.  Hanging from the ceiling by a series of slender bronze chains is a beautiful replica of an airship fitted for battle."
