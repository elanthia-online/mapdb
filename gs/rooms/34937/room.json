      "Birch logs of varying sizes are strapped together with rawhide and chinked with tufts of fleece, creating a snug shelter that is airtight despite the fridged air outside.  Tendrils of smoke drift up from a small fire that rests in a depression at the center of the floor and is surrounded by layers upon layers of sheepskin blankets.  Dozens of charms dangle from long cords that are anchored to the ceiling, each hanging decoration clinking together as the wind outside sighs."
