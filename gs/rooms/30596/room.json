      "Painted blue walls surround this small alcove off the central nexus above.  The focal point of the space is a swirling seafoam green portal framed by an intricately carved albino kraken.  A collection of ships of all shapes and sizes have been etched between the tentacles that drape around the portal.  A tropical breeze swirls around the area, scented like oranges and coconuts."
