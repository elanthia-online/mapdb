      "An uneven pergola of scorched wood lays bare across the patches of dead grass, the half-collapsed structure leaning away from the direction of the stone-crafted mansion.  Brittle strands of webbing drape across a small grove encircling the perimeter of the grounds, the silken veils billowing with the ambient breeze, the leafless twigs piercing through withered insect carcasses.  Chipped marble statues flank the pathway leading north, the expressionless faces marred by vein-like cracks across their lips."
