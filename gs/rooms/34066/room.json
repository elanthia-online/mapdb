      "Stately houses with old stone facades line the street as it ends in a small cobblestone court.  Their sprawling estates are dotted with pine trees, and in one yard, a garden full of colorful flowers thrives near the banks of a steaming hot spring.  One manse at the northernmost edge of the circle has gates of pale holly inlaid with walnut, a path of flagstones beyond shaded by old pine trees festooned with bright garlands."
