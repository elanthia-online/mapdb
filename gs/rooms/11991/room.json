      "A grey tower thrusts itself up from the pinnacle of the hill like a finger pointing toward the stars.  Each block of granite making up the wall of the tower is carved with varying sizes of eight-pointed stars. Etched into the keystone of the arched entrance leading into the tower is the rounded orb of a full moon.  A flight of broken stone steps leads back down the side of the hill.",

Etched into the keystone of the arched entrance leading into the tower is a multi-rayed representation of the sky.  A flight of broken stone steps leads back down the side of the hill."
