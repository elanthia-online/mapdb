      "Lighted torches line the entire length of this great hall.  A giant oak table surrounded by chairs sits in the center of the hall.  Numerous plates and mugs sit on top of the table showing recent signs of use.  Two massive fireplaces sit at opposite ends of the room, the ashes of many fires still in evidence inside them.  Piles of fresh straw have been neatly arranged against the walls, seemingly as makeshift beds.  Faded banners hang from the ceiling timbers covered by years of dust and fire soot."
