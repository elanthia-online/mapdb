      "Thick ropelike roots protruding from the walls have been hacked away to allow further passage in both directions.  Most of the underground tendrils are brown and dried, but a few still ooze a sticky brownish sap.  Trapped within the syrupy fluid are numerous tiny insects, this meal evidently their last."
