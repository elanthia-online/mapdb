      "Extending from the base of an arching catwalk, meticulous sand and crushed shell paths wind their way through lush, well-tended flowerbeds toward the islet's ivory spire.  A dome of shining gold caps the tall tower, glistening in the bright sunlight.  The smell of salt permeates the area anew with each successive crash of the ocean against the small island's rocky shores.  A set of ironwood double doors affixed with a small plaque leads inside the tall tower."
