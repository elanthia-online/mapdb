      "Dark rocky forms loom menacingly in the distance to the west and southwest, making passage beyond them impossible.  Water can be heard crashing up against the rocks, throwing a fine mist to be carried by the swift breeze.  Waves of ocean water propel backwards, carrying a froth of foam mixed with debris."
