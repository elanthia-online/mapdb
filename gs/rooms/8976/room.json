    "description": [
      "Decorated in rich, but subdued shades, the showroom gives a feeling of understated comfort while providing little to draw attention away from the sparkling wares.  Overhead, a chandelier strung with quartz prisms provides ample lighting for a brushed silver jewelry stand sitting atop a long glass display case.  The back wall is occupied by ornately carved shelves holding a collection of curios."
