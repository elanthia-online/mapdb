      "Turtle grass thins along the corridor, giving way to patches of bare sand and scattered shale fragments.  Shale walls rise steeply on either side, veined with ribbons of silver mica that catch the faint light filtering through narrow ceiling gaps.  A natural arch of water-worn shale spans the corridor ahead, its rough edges softened by time.  Beneath the arch, the passage splits toward the northeast and northwest, where the glimmer of mica threads deeper into the shadowed caverns."
