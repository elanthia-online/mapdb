      "A steaming bath, its waters likely piped from a water source below the castle, is set into the floor of the spacious chamber, ringed by a collection of lazing grotesques that are taller than a handspan.  The other half of the long room is dedicated to a sprawling bed heaped high with furs.  Separating the two, a long ash dresser is carved with bramble patterns."
