      "Beneath an imposing basalt arch etched with a snarling krolvin face, a reinforced black spruce gate opens onto a crowded plaza.  Animals screech from cages by a shouting street vendor, while nearby, a hawker gregariously peddles cold fish and hot broth to hungry travelers.  Krolvin sentries armed with arbalests watch over the throng from guard towers positioned to either side of the gateway."
