      "Along the walls of the meeting chamber, floor-to-ceiling panels of dark wood are graced with figures in gilt depicting exchanges of goods for coin and proud merchant vessels with their sails strained by favorable winds.  Circular in shape, the hall houses rows of seats in a raised gallery that overlooks a more intimate table ringed by grander chairs that are almost thrones in their own right.  Dark teal banners wave above, each embroidered with a set of golden scales loaded with coin."
