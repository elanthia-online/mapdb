      "Staring down from the foremost part of the ship, the prow gives view to the maidenhead fixed to the sharply slanted bowsprit.  A seagull sits perched on the railing, fixed with curious gaze.  Hewn from a single piece of timber, the foremast soars above the deck, a pennant fluttering at its peak."
