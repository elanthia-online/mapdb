      "Metallic runes etched into the cavern's rock gleam faintly red in the presence of the hot lava flowing far below.  Occupying a clearing among the stalagmites are a handful of short, glaes-topped stands arranged in a rough circle.  Archways covered with thick, woven curtains are spaced regularly along the wall."
