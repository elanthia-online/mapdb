    "description": [
      "Originating from an upper ridge along Thunder Plateau, a frothy waterfall seizes both power and grace in one of this landscape's most elegant creations.  Named for its movement along the spiny ridges of the mountain and its resemblance to that of a dragon and its tail, Dragon Falls is a popular attraction among locals and tourists.  Fine mist lingers in the air, dampening an over-soggy terrain and safeguarding this land from becoming more than a wonderous sightseeing spot at the mountain's base."
