    "description": [
      "At the base of some broad stone steps, cultivated cousins of wild local trees form a small arbor.  The bite of pine resin is cool and clean on the frigid air, rising off of Olbin pine and Ossian spruce.  One side of the garden is bordered by the facade of abbey, while the other is framed by the edge of the cliff upon which the compound is built."
