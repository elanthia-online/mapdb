    "description": [
      "Strolling along this road, bounded on the right by a tall fragrant evergreen hedge, folks seem to be in good spirits.  The hurried pace of life to the south is forgotten as the soft sound of gently flowing water filters in from the west.  One man in the crowd attracts the eye as he enters the circle from the west, his face drawn and pale, but filled with hope as he leans heavily on the shoulder of his companion.  They move on, leaving behind a sense of well-being that is slow to fade."
