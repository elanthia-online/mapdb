      "Built up defenses along the outer edge of the flotilla cast twisting shadows across the wide expanse of moonlit deck.  Several empty bottles line up near the docking slip for a derelict carrack listing heavily to port, and a series of painted buoys dangles near the open waters at the flotilla's center.  At the center of the deck is a whimsical sea glass inlay depicting a drowned moose snuggling with a siren."
