      "A pair of wicker figures flanks the base pillars of a rune-carved grey granite arch leading into a village of huge longhouses and tall dwellings of raw timber.  Incense and herbs pepper the air, carried on the whistling breeze from a huge circular building at the village center that is carved into the bole of an immense living hoarbeam tree.  Wreaths of pale blue iceblossom and darker violet resting poppies have been strung from the archway."
