      "Amber radiance seethes from the west in even pulses.  It is accompanied by a faint hum that resonates through the surrounding stalagmites, making droplets of water shiver and dance as they trickle down the sides of the stone formations.  An intense odor of stale vinegar hangs on the cold air, the scent distinctly out of place amidst the melange of mineral-laden water and the earthiness of abundant mushrooms."
