      "Covering the center of the marble floor, a crushed velvet runner of gold-filigree and red muffles the sound of passersby as they explore the wing.  Ebon veining traces its away across the white marble walls, which glistens in the light of several frosted globes that dangle from the ceiling.  Perched upon the tile floor and set back from the central runner, several glass-paned display cases and gold-inlaid linden curios showcase rare finds."
