      "The marble flagstones in this small chamber have been inlaid with thin lines of silver, forming a complex circular pattern on the floor.  Suspended from the ceiling, a tripod-shaped lamp provides steady illumination.  The comforting gurgle of flowing water echoes from an open doorway on the eastern wall, while an elaborate archway leads into the quiet din of the tavern room to the south."
