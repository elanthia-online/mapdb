      "Wainscoted panels of the highest quality have been pieced together to create this prim and airy boutique, almost indistinguishable from a standing shop in any fine city.  A gold-legged display case houses a variety of fine handkerchiefs, while an array of pillow-topped pedestals show off tasteful gloves.  A beautiful melange of tasteful and exotic scents meanders through the room."
