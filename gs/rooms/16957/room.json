      "The canopy overhead thins out enough to allow sunlight to play across the forest floor.  In its benevolence grow a host of plants, from tumbles of blackberry vines to flowering lilies and wild roses.  Small woodland violets dot the green with multicolored, jewel-like blossoms, and huge clumps of ferns ring the rampant verdure like hosts welcoming visiting family members."
