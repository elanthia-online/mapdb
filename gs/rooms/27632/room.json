      "A blue watered silk tapestry hangs on one of the thick slate walls, and a low skylight-set ceiling rises overhead.  A fragrant pink jasmine plant sits in one corner of a swirled sea glass floor.  There is a wide knotted oak counter on one side of the shop and a carved haon armoire on the other."
