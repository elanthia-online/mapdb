      "The focus of the decadently decorated bedroom is a tall four-poster bed set immediately within sight of the doorway.  Underneath the bed's canopy, a skeleton in rotting robes lies sprawled across the dusty sheets, one boney hand still gripping a hanging canopy cord.  A second skeleton lies against an opposite wall near a book shelf and just under a candelabra.  Light streams into the room from a large window across from the bed to shine across an opened tome lying on the floor as if dropped.",
