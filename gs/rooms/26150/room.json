      "Brambles choke the western edges of fortresses exterior, their thick limbs laden with finger-length thorns and shriveled russet leaves.  Untended cobbles have lifted where brown grass, once verdant and strong, has forced its way between the mortar and created an uneven ground to walk upon.  A series of wrought iron spikes affixed to the granite walls provide defense against would-be attackers."
