      "Though not at all shoddy in build, the accoutrements of a knight that adorn a mannequin in the center of the stall seem mismatched, as if whomever put them together had little sense of suave style.  Spare accessories and surcoats dangle from a rack, appearing as if they may fall off of their perches at any time.  Lending color to the stall, red and platinum banners hang overhead, and a hawker's assistant laughs cheerfully as he bumbles and trips around the area.",
