    "description": [
      "Lighting deficiencies and the constant reverberation of sounds make disorientation commonplace at this point in the entanglement of caves and tunnels.  Silvery blue flecks dot the encircling tenebrous stone walls, a quasi star-filled night sky.  With a fairly claustrophobic, maximum width of about five feet and few stretches of straight travel, the risk of body-to-stone collision is highly probable."
