    "description": [
      "Niches in the stone large honeycomb the cavern walls high overhead as the natural gallery approaches a jutting overhang that cradles most of the stony crescent.  Many are empty, but several are sealed shut with a resinous ochre substance that has mostly hardened.  The cold air of the upper cavern revolts against hot air belching up from below, which is laden with a sharply pungent odor reminiscent of vinegar."
