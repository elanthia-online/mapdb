      "Several tiny crystal charms dangle from the speckled cap of a nearby luminescent toadstool, glimmering in the soft white light.  A trio of onyx orbs have been suspended above the small landing to a wide black marble stairway.  The distant sounds of training can be heard originating from the grand, descending passage."
