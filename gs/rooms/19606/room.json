      "Copper lanterns sway from the support poles of the tent and cast warm illumination upon the polished teak floors that have been cleared for dancing space.  Painted ivy trails down the white walls of the pavilion, while bright blossoms are painted into the fabric of the ceiling in an attempt to bring the jungle inside.  A ring of silken cushions lines the walls, though a path has been cleared to leave access to the flap leading out."
