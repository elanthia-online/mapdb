      "Draped in sky-blue clustervine, a latticed wooden pergola casts intricate shadows across the tiled seating area, where the cool night air offers a refreshing escape.  A mosaic fountain stands in the center, its water gently cascading into a small brook that flows softly over cracked pavers, glistening in the moonlight.  Potted plants surround the area, their colorful succulents and blooms catching the glow of nearby lanterns.  At the edge of the space, a weathered sundial, bathed in silver light, marks the passage of time under the stars."
