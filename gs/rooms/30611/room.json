      "Ambient light filters through the large stained-glass windows that dominate the face of the shop, the filtered light chasing red, amber, and copper colors across the knotty pine walls.  Floor-to-ceiling brick and stone ovens line the eastern wall and fill the air with a heavy, warm heat.  Several wrought iron chairs flank small round tables and are pushed far enough back to allow customers ample space to purchase wares at a long and low copper-edged counter."
