      "The clash of steel rings out sharply from the enclosed yard of a barracks near the crescent.  Flying black and azure banners marked with a notched cutlass, the outpost occupies a capacious edifice that has the look of a small fortress.  A few seabirds have nested in the eaves, staining the dark stone white with their leavings."
