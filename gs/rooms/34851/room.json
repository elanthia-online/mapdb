      "Tall, mold-riddled columns encircle the vast second floor, the mahogany pillars separating the numerous hallways and doors radiating from the cloth-covered object at the center of the carpeted floor. Oilcloth covers the rectangular frames affixed to the peeling walls, the pieces covered in overgrown weeds. A detritus-scattered pile of metal is nestled along a far corner, propped against a broken bench beside the iron-railed staircase."
