      "Numerous tiny shops cluster around the small cobblestone roads that meet at a grassy sward.  Festooned with copper gear-linked ribbons, cherry trees arch over a stone well, and a small gazebo nestles amidst rosebushes.  Just off the grassy expanse is a stone-paved plaza with booths, carts, and kiosks surrounding a clockwork fountain."
