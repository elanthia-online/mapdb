      "Snow falls steadily on the conifer forest, but much of it is driven west by the prevailing wind, so the accumulation is nearly negligible.  The falling snow hides tracks quickly, though, and the forest appears to be a pristine wilderness, untouched by adventurers or creatures.  Several of the pines are ancient specimens, their age unknown, but their trunks so wide that a giantman could not wrap his arms halfway around them."
