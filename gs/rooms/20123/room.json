      "A musty smell of decaying plant life hangs heavily in the still air.  Slick, lichen-covered rocks make for hazardous travel along the main north to south route.  Tall, greyish-white trees block out much of the sky, and long-abandoned nests droop precariously from the unions of bare branches with the bark-stripped trunks."
