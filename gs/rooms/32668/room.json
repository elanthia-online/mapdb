      "Several rows of oak casks line one side of this room, stacked from floor to ceiling.  Running down the other side of the space is a lacquered ebonwood bar at the perfect height for a dwarf.  At the far end of the room, a large fire pit is tended by a stout Khanshael pitmaster who is diligently attending to multiple spits of aromatic meat roasting over dancing flames.  A wide and well used table spans the length of the room's center, affording various Khanshael the chance to share tales, food, and drink."
