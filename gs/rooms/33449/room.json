      "A scuffed oak floor is enclosed by pastel green walls.  A long vanity with several mirrors lines one wall.  Stools have been provided at the vanities so performers can put last minute touches to their make-up.  Couches and chairs make cozy sitting areas around mismatched braided rugs.  A few green plants sit in clay pots, adding a bit of serenity to the room.  There is a small niche in the wall next to the door."
