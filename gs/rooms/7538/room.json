      "This chamber seems artificial in some way you can't quite place.  The walls are still smooth, but the whole room is shaped like a teardrop laid sideways, narrowing to a small opening at its eastern end.  In the middle of the western wall is a very small, gothic-style wooden plank door with a brass sign on it."
