      "Hugging the river's edge, a slender path dips in and out of the nearby shrubbery as it lazily leads in a roughly northerly direction up the river.  Large stones, smoothed by the passage of water, rise along the banks and create a small barrier from the rapidly moving current as it dramatically dips to the south.  Lichen, moss, and ferns are prevalent here, their thick roots making the banks firm and durable."
