    "description": [
      "This small and uncharacteristically flat expanse of land surrounds the crumbling remnants of a once great tower that still manages despite its great age to stand tall.  Stones and rocks, some natural, some part of the original construct lie scattered around the landscape.  A rotted log stretches over the moat, leading shakily up to the battered and time weary doors which hang awkwardly from their hinges."
