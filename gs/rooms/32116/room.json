      "A fungus-laden rotted fishing dock extends into the slow moving stream, a thick patch of luminescent crimson algae bobbing on the surface near each deteriorated piling.  Barely discerned through a tightly grown, entangled leafless canopy overhead is a sky of dull, featureless grey.  A patch of oily black water gently ebbs between the algae growing around the dock, a flickering shadowy reflection across its surface distorted and jagged."
