      "Large and capacious, the council room has a triangular shape.  Seven wedge-like areas are partitioned from each other by carved banisters and are filled with a variety of chairs and tables.  Each section tapers in size to a platform that holds a large marble podium.  Tapestries hang along the back wall of the chamber, positioned above one of the smaller spaces."
