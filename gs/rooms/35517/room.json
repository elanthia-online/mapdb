    "description": [
      "Glasstide roses bloom in fragile clusters secreted among the rocky walls, their translucent petals refracting the shifting light.  A jagged archway of stone marks the entrance to the bazaar that stretches over a soft, sandy bottom where rippling currents carve delicate patterns in the grains.  Vivid corals in deep blues, golds, and crimsons cling to the walls, their branching forms creating a labyrinth of color.  Schools of fish dart past drifting strands of sea flora swaying with the tide."
