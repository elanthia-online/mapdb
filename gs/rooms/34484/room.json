      "High ceilings supported by exposed rafters that are in turn held in place by steel footings lend the workshop a lofty feel despite the scattered tools, springs, gears, and wire that is strewn about the floor.  Open cabinets with everything from paint brushes, enamel canisters, and broken gemstones line the north and south wall, while the east one houses a window that has a painted off-white banner hanging across it.  Several finished projects rest upon a central mahogany worktable."
