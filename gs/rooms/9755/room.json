      "The walkway levels off, skirting a pair of wall hangings.  As it passes them, it widens, offering a much safer vantage point from which to examine the two artifacts.  On the left hangs a woven band, no wider than a palm, but so long that it stretches up out of sight in the gloom above.  Beside it hangs a large silk tapestry depicting a forest scene.  The incline narrows to either side of the wall hangings, spiraling both up and down the bole of the tree in a sinuous curve."
