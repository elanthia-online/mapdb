      "Sheets of thin wood are strung between leafless apple trees and bound in place by thickly braided hempen cords.  Rows of brightly colored inflated orbs are anchored to the face of the wooden sheets, which are pockmarked with hundreds of tiny puncture marks.  A pile of sharp metal darts lies on the stump of an old tree that acts as a makeshift counter, while a dirty huckster lounges nearby."
