      "Six evenly spaced, anchor beams of sturdy, whitewashed oak rest upon matching arcade posts down the length of the nave and create the framework that supports the stable's walls and roof.  Matching wind braces stretch from the scarred threshing floor of hard-packed dirt to the haon-planked ceiling, each crosspiece decorated with ornate meadowlark lanterns.  In the east is a turquoise stall door, while opposite stands a large rain barrel."
