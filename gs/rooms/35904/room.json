      "Spindled roots dangle from the ceiling, nature finding a way to invade the home within the barrow despite thick rafters and heavy planking.  Copper-sided lanterns are spread throughout the space, their sides decorated in avians that create shadows on the rough walls and hard-packed dirt floor.  A simple cot rests in one corner near a fireplace, while a variety of containers in blue, red, and green are clustered near the exit."
