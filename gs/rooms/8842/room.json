    "description": [
      "The lane curves along the back of a row of old warehouses, forming an intersection with a smaller dirt road that leads north.  Clotheslines have been hung between the cottages and the warehouse walls, and a variety of colorful but simple garb flaps in the intermittent breeze.  A circle of stones in the intersection surrounds a poorly tended flowerbed that sports more weeds than roses."
