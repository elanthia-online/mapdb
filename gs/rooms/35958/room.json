      "Illuminated by windows of slender glass panels divided by overwrought mullions reaching nearly to the ceiling, the room is dominated by a massive four-poster bed forged from dark glaes, the tapered pillars traced with swirling inlays of silver.  The doors of an ebony wardrobe stand slightly ajar, the contents reflected in an adjacent full-length mirror.  Attached to the armrest of a tone-on-tone damask chaise lounge, a silver tray can be used for tea service or doubles as a makeshift writing desk."
