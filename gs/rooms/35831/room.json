      "More subdued lighting than found in the entry beyond, the somber setting lends a hushed tone conducive to quiet work and focused study.  Fat velvet cushions in shades of tea and wine are arranged in a semi-circle around a round rosewood worktable set before several dusty shelves filled wth all manner of vials, tubes, jars, and bottles.  Hanging from the center of the ceiling sways a large chandelier of citrine crystal points clustered around several candle-lit votives."
