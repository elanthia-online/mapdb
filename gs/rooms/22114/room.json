      "Surrounded by a grove of white oak, the clearing is shielded under a verdant leafy canopy above.  Several hewn logs are set around a riverstone fire pit, pale moss beginning to blanket the surface.  A pile of sticks is stacked neatly to one side sorted by size and thickness.  Set into a smaller niche, a polished modwir swing hangs from one of the tallest trees.  Moonlight filters through from the natural roof illuminating the area below.",
