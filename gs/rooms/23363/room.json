      "A ceiling washed in deep blue and indigo is studded with sparkling diamonds of white, yellow, and pale blue.  Constellations form and scatter as the gems inexplicably shift positions, as though the domed ceiling were fluid rather than stone.  The gems reflect the light cast by the flames of white candles, clustered on a low silver oval table.  A large grey sheepskin rug is soft underfoot, dotted with some tasseled blue velvet pillows.  The walls are bare, save for a black silk tapestry on the eastern wall."
