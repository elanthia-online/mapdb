      "The path through the swamp twists and turns, no more than an animal trail leading deeper into the marshy area.  Reeds and tall cattails line the path preventing little access to the insect-ridden waters to either side.  Dark shapes pass overhead, vanishing silhouettes in the thick, damp fog blanketing the area.",
      "The path through the swamp twists and turns, no more than an animal trail leading deeper into the marshy area.  Reeds and tall cattails are barely visible in the darkness, lining the path and serving as tactile warning of the insect-ridden waters beyond.  A thick, damp fog blankets the area, reducing visibility to only a few feet ahead at any time."
