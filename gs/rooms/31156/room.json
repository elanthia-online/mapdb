      "Snuggling up against the granite cliff-face is a stand of autumn-hued trees riddled with nannyberries and in various stages of growth with the smaller specimens crowding around the taller tree.  Smaller bushes sprout out of the ground-hugging mist that tumbles in from the slightly elevated northwest, while taller species with lustrous foliage stretches its flower-laden limbs skyward.  Round blue-black fruit, resembling flat pebbles, sprout from each species with abandon."
