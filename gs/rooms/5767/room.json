      "This large storeroom has been looted with savage fury.  Iron shelves lie rusting on the ground, the metal twisted and torn from some tremendous stress.  Barrel staves and metal hoops lie shattered against the walls, their contents long since disappeared.  A wooden rack that once contained pickaxes and other tools of the stonecutters' trade remains intact, though the tools themselves have been broken and scattered about the room."
