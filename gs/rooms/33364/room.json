      "The oak floor and walls of this efficiency-sized hunting cabin are timeworn, scratched, and pitted, but anyone can see this cabin was built to last.  Utilitarian in nature, the single room has been left unadorned but for a mounted tapir head on the wall directly across from the entrance, and an entire wall has been dedicated to a weapons display.  A stout stool rests next to a small, unlit cast iron stove to the left of the door.  To the right of the door hangs a bloodstained game bag on a wooden hook."
