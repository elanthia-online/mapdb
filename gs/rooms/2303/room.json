      "Homes line the road, their doors painted in a riot of colors.  The dwellings follow no set plan, ranging from stately pine lodges to round-doored burrows tucked into the sides of nearby hillocks.  One grey stone manse is secured by a black wrought iron gate.  Residents wander the road, waving to one another and stopping to converse.  A half-krolvin denizen stands on a ladder, carefully touching up the paint on a neighbor's roof while a gaggle of halflings shouts suggestions from below.",
      "Small houses line the road, painted in a riot of bright colors.  The dwellings follow no set plan, some with one story, others with two.  Halflings wander down the road, waving to each other and stopping to converse.  One halfling stands on a ladder, carefully touching up the paint on his roof while his wife looks on, giving orders.",
      "Small houses line the road.  The dwellings follow no set plan, some with one story and others with two.  The street is almost deserted at this time of day, with only an occasional halfling passing by with home and hot food clearly on their mind."
