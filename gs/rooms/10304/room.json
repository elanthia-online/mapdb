      "A carved walnut door flanked by two brass torch holders is recessed into the wall of the inn's easternmost sleeping room.  Smooth marble walkways lead northwest and southwest around the diamond that is the inn's central courtyard.  A flourishing honeysuckle hedge forms a pleasant barrier between the walkways and the inner courtyard, separating those who wish to find a sleeping room from those who wish to sit at the tables and converse or just enjoy the courtyard's fountain."
