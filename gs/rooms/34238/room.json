      "A wide pool of red-orange fluid, thick and sluggish, spans much of the chamber.  The syrupy substance has a pungent sweetness to it that, combined with the heat billowing into the chamber from craggy vents along its exterior, makes the air heavy to the point of suffocation.  Though little light penetrates the murky jelly, the glow of crystals in the chamber's ceiling catches on humanoid figures trapped near the surface, reduced to twisted shapes of vitrifying flesh and exposed bone."
