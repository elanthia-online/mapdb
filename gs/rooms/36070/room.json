      "Dozens of nautical charts are plastered on the walls of this tightly cramped room.  Some piles of half-opened tomes are haphazardly strewn about, mingling in with stacks of scrolls and discarded parchment.  Four small stools are gathered around an easel displaying a detailed depiction of the port of Solhaven and its bay.  The only visible sleeping surface amongst the clutter is a faded cot, although the layer of cat hair present on it suggests the identity of its most recent user."
