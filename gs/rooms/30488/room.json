      "To the southwest, the lighthouse provides a reassuring bulwark, the foggy light it projects contrasting sharply with the jagged basalt teeth rising to the northeast and north.  Moonlight glistens upon the calm shallows, calling attention to the range of turquoise hues in the shadowy depths of the water."
