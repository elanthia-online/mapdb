      "An uncomplicated chandelier of iron and brass hangs from the ceiling near the entrance, supplementing the meager light streaming through the doorway into the windowless chamber.  In an alcove sits an old modwir desk, the space atop it littered with stacks of letters and unsent parcels.  From above comes the muted cawing of ravens."
