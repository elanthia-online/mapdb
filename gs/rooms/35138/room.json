      "Seafarers bedecked in a colorful collection of open-fronted coats, bandoliers, and tricorns gather below a low plinth that raises the guild's steward above the crowd.  Along the cold stone walls, heads of great pelagic beasts are mounted on boards of polished driftwood, their glass eyes regarding the ruckus impassively.  A bone statue of a sea serpent stands nearby, similarly disinterested in the affairs of the guild and its members."
