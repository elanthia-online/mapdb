      "Although of good construction and well-maintained, the half-timber townhomes lining both sides of the road are definitely a step down from the walled villas and manors to the east and north.  Huddled in a doorway, a trio of young boys chat quietly as they stoop to examine some object of vital interest.",
      "The waves of the Sunderer's Glaive lap at the white sands surrounding Murre Court, where large piles of materials lie around the foundation of a nascent construction project.  Pastel paints stand out like ghostly lights over the dark walls that, but for a high archway, would seal the court completely off from the street.  Spades of emerald imflass protrude from tops of the walls, making the archway the only safe means of egress.",
      "The waves of the Sunderer's Glaive lap at the white sands surrounding the multicolored tiles of the courtyard, the center of which is dominated by a red-banded alabaster spire surrounded by several levitating vessels.  Their low-pitched droning sound fills the air with a constant thrumming sound.  Pastel paints stand out like ghostly lights over the dark walls of the court.  Spades of red imflass protrude from the tops of the walls, making a carved archway the only safe means of egress."
