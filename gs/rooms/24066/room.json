      "Ringed by a colonnade, fruit trees and other flora fill the tiered garden sinking down below the main level.  Each level has a carved stone bench placed near fragrant flowers or shady dwarf plane trees.  Colorful, trellised bougainvillea scales the villa walls in a riot of fuchsia, coral, and purple blossoms.  The edge of the cliff upon which the building is perched commands a stunning view of the Stormbrow volcano, and a small studio at the far end of the terrace creates a private retreat.",

Each level has a carved stone bench placed near fragrant flowers or shady dwarf plane trees.  Two large torches flank the entrance of the villa, adding a soft illumination to the fragrant gardens.  The edge of the cliff upon which the building is perched commands a stunning view of the Stormbrow volcano, and a small studio at the far end of the terrace creates a private retreat."
