      "Colossal jet black rocks, sharp-cornered and irregular, protrude at varying angles from a sanguine sea of poppies.  Shallowly incised runes cover the entirety of the formations, the symbols too worn to be decipherable.  Nigh intoxicating, a heady floral aroma pervades the air, caught between the arboreal silhouettes bordering the eastern and western edges of the efflorescent field."
