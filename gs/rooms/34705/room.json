      "Evenly spaced square windows proceed along the walls of the barracks, letting in spills of daylight that harshly illuminate the interior.  In lines as straight as tombstones in a cemetery, bunks proceed to either direction.  Each has a footlocker at the base, but personal touches, a copper locket hung over a bedknob, or a carved set of initials in the wood, are few and far between.  Emblazoned on one wall is the sigil of a dark tower wreathed in flames."
