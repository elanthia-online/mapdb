      "The polished red sandstone floors and dark modwir wainscoting give this ample lounge a peaceful warmth.  Deep-cushioned chairs are drawn up around a white and red marble fireplace, above which hangs a beveled glass mirror framed in wrought iron.  A silver serving cart is stationed near the carved basalt arch that leads into this room, an ivory medallion set at its apex."
