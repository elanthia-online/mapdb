      "Footsteps send echoes into the barn's cavernous space.  From up in the lofty rafters, the soft chattering of swallows mingles with the occasional coo of doves.  Slanting beams of moonlight shine in, throwing pools of silver light on the rough-planked floor.  The place is reminiscent of a cathedral and the sweet smell of hay makes a fine replacement for the aroma of incense.",

Slanting beams of sunlight shine in, throwing pools of golden light on the rough-planked floor.  The place is reminiscent of a cathedral and the sweet smell of hay makes a fine replacement for the aroma of incense."
