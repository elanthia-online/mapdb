      "A huge bowl has been excavated from the solid volcanic substrate here.  The rock has been chiseled to form long curving rows of backless stone benches.  Emerald cloth has been piled atop the benches to cushion the seats.  A tall, circular, white marble dais graces the center of the bowl.  Around the bowl's upper edges, huge rectangular stones tower with blazing torches sprouting up and down their sides, and an insignia has been carefully etched near the top of each massive stone."
