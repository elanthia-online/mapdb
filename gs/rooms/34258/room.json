    "description": [
      "Clouds of mephitic vapor whisk over the exotic stone of the raised terrace, but do not seem to disturb the churning mass of kiramon larvae swarming its surface.  Most of the distended bodies are as pale as a fish's belly, but a few are the color of dried blood or burnt umber.  They leave trails of translucent sludge behind that slicks the stones as they wriggle.  Their evident source is a forest of dry and cracked wax chambers below the terrace."
