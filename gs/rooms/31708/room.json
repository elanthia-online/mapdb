    ],
    "description": [
      "Excepting a pair of trees growing tall against the fence, this plot of the graveyard is largely empty, just a stretch of grass, weeds, and wind-tumbled leaves that have gathered in the corners between iron bars and tree roots.  The accommodations seem fine enough for one creature, a massive orb spider that has made its web in the crook created by limb and tree trunk.  Its anchors span the distance to the fence and ground, silver-white and shimmering, and the web's tremendous size gives a hint to its age."
