      "The grass-covered mound rises twenty feet above the surrounding moor, too perfectly round and flat-topped to have been formed by nature.  The wind seems to swirl in a constant vortex here, tossing faint tendrils of mist and tiny bits of grass and debris in playful eddies, and the air crackles with a strange, tingling energy, as if a storm were brewing overhead.",
