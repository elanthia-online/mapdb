      "A solid wall of evergreens fills the intersection's northeast corner, providing privacy and seclusion for whatever lies beyond.  In contrast, facing the trees from the other side of Eastbridge, a black iron fence -- its gate gaping wide at the corner -- does nothing to hide the brownstone crypt standing in the center of that plot.  Above the gate, a brown enamelled lozenge bears the image of a coiled, green snake."
