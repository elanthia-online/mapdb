      "Thick leather straps with large silver hooks on each end have been wrapped around several pieces of furniture, securing them to an adjacent shelf-lined wall.  A stained driftwood counter sits opposite a copper-banded cask, and a circular window offers a glimpse of the outside, filling the otherwise dark room with minimal moonlight.  Lingering in the humid, salt-charged air is a heavy aroma of alcohol."
