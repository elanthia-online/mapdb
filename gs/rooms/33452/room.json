      "From this vantage point, one can see all that happens on the stage just beyond the slightly open curtain.  From this room, it is quite possible that every whisper could be heard by an audience.  Above are pulleys through which braided ropes are drawn and left to drape down.  The rope ends are coiled neatly to avoid mishap."
