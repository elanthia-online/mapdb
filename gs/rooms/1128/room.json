    "description": [
      "Reeds and succulent water plants crowd the banks of the creek to drink in the flowing waters.  They combine with the encroaching trees to make progress more difficult.  The ground feels solid enough, if only one could see it through all the vegetation.  The reeds bend, snap and crush underfoot, and movement becomes slowed. The trail seems to be completely lost in the undergrowth, but the direction of the creek is an indication as to which way to proceed."
