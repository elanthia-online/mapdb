      "Plush carpets stretch across the hard ground beneath an oilcloth ceiling painted with mottled brown and red hues.  Brass and glaesine lanterns hang from the central support, providing ample illumination for consumers to view the wares that are neatly displayed throughout the structure.  A round table hugs the support post, its center cut out to accommodate the rough oak, while a series of river reed baskets lines the back wall and a knotty pine display case stands near the entry."
