      "Glossy blue slate, lacquered to resemble ice, stretches across the floor of the shop, reflecting the ambient light of the corner-built fireplace and giving the space a warm, soft glow.  Grey stone walls decorated with heavy tapestries support the exposed beam ceiling, while a long wooden counter faces the entry and is draped with various pelts, hides, and fabrics for customers to peruse.  A standing tapestry loom and a birch curing rack occupy spaces on opposite sides of the fireplace."
