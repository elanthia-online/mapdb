      "Smooth white stone rises from the even floor to create the curved walls of the circular chamber, their peaks disappearing into the shadows of the distant ceiling.  Warm and bright light emanates from candles that are arranged in tiny alcoves around the archway that leads to the northeast, while to the southwest, a series of large obelisks dominates the chamber."
