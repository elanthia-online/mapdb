      "A stunted, shriveled worm corpse lies in a pool of partially frozen muck amidst the wreckage of a fallen stone wall.  The creature is mostly buried in the rubble.  Heavy blankets of sticky, glowing silk drape over the fallen corpse and the surrounding stones like a funeral shroud, rippling in the cold air currents."
