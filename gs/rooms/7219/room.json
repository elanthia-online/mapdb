      "Frozen bodies are tumbled across the floor like fallen logs.  Some have broken into pieces, fallen from the rows that once lined the grey stone walls, others show only a light scuffing of the ice that coats them.  Spiderwebs string between them like a cat's cradle, glimmering with tiny gems of frost.  Sitting in the center of the room is a perfectly preserved heart, frozen as solid as the rock of the chamber."
