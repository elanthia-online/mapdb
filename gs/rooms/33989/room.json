      "Tall, brittle grass encircles a dozen toparies, their androgynous forms left in disarray along the fairy ring of dirt and loose rock.  A contorted wall of overgrown briars forms the boundaries of the garden, the uneven hedges leaning precariously inwards, the sharp thorns threatening to engulf the garden beds.  A trio of empty birdbaths sit tangled in vines in the back of the garden, filled with loose feathers intermingled with clumps of dirt."
