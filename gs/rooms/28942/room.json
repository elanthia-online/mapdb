      "A small counter occupies the back wall, its backdrop a large glass tank housing a variety of colorful fish.  Stretched beneath a tall drying rack covered in stretched animal skins, a loosely-woven seagrass mat attempts to protect the wagon floors from scuffing but does little to hide the wear and tear.  A cheerful windchime of two pewter octopuses sways in the doorway of the shop."
