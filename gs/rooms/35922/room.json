      "Thin fingers of mist recoil from the path that leads westward, their feathery lengths bathed in a golden cast by the wisp lanterns growing at the base of a sweetgum tree just beyond the bordering split rail fence.  The trunk of the tree is festooned with wide-cut burlap ribbons from which dangle clusters of dyed corn husk bows, colorful sprigs of leaves, and acorn accents.  In the air, a vague hint of smoke accompanies the chill."
