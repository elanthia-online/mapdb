      "Billowing tan canvas towers high above, supporting poles set in place with sections of the tent tied securely to them.  Three sun-bleached tables centrally placed in a horseshoe shape have been set up to display many wares, while the heady scent of jasmine and honeysuckle permeates the area with coils of incense smoke.  Scarves of every fabric and shade weave around the various poles and create a wall partition, while matching their hues are the painted murals of tribal symbols on the exterior canvas tent walls."
