      "Every open surface of the study's walls is neatly covered in maps and charts, each bearing organized and color-coded, but incomprehensible, notes and markings.  An intricate brass sextant and astrolabe set hang over a case, and sunlight dapples the surface of a teak desk and matching chair.  Between a chart of the lunar cycles and several small constellation drawings sits a bookcase overflowing with additional research and information."
