      "The floor of this room is inlaid with a pentagram of teal and gold, the gold shining softly in the light of two large crystal-pane windows that take up the whole of one wall.  An azure and green chaise lounge upholstered in silk sits in a cozy corner near a huge ebonwood fireplace with brass appointments.  A cleverly arranged arch of shelves completes the room's furnishings."
