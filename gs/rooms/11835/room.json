      "Creeping vines and a thick growth of low-lying grass extends across a large space of ground that was probably once a huge open market where the inhabitants of the city could hawk their assorted produce and wares.  To the east the flattened tip of a tall tower pokes its black silhouette above the dark, jagged outline of a series of walls.",
