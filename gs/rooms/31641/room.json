      "The walls are tiled in cracked pieces of porcelain, the sharp pieces painted with tiny wrens, their broken bodies scattered across the wooden floor.  Small clay pots with bell-shaped purple and white flowers hang above sets of bent cutlery set on a cutting block, with a trail of berries smashed between the handles.  A set of shelves diagonally drop above a grime-covered porcelain wash basin beside a small glass-paned door, the shattered glass jars seeping their liquid down to a woolen rug."
