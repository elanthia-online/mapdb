      "A flash of motion may be an owl, but in the gloom it moves too quickly to be identifiable.  The trees crowd in together, as if to block any vision beyond the next few feet.  A trickle of water breaks through the rocks beside the path, but is barely enough to keep the moss wet.",
      "A flash of motion above reveals a swooping bird, snacking on the bugs hovering in the air.  The trees crowd in together, as if to block any vision beyond the next few feet.  A trickle of water breaks through the rocks beside the path, but is barely enough to keep the moss wet."
