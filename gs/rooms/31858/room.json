      "Wide windows let heat escape the small store, allowing the twilight hues of the sky to paint the whitewashed walls in ribbons of aquamarine, cerulean, coral, indigo, and violet.  Storage crates line the back wall, each with indiscernible shipping labels that curl back slightly from the rough wood.  Large display cabinets house various stoves for sale, while a plain basket on the store's only counter whispers as a slight breeze rustles the parchments within."
