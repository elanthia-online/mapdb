      "The metallic tang of steel still seems to hang in the air here.  Lit only by a guttering torch, the shadows leap and dance in the room's corners.  The forge and bellows seem to be in good repair, but covered with a very thin film of dust.  The anvil is covered with rust, almost hiding the years of hard service.  Ingots and blanks for various weapons are neatly stacked up against the wall, as if awaiting a smith's return."
