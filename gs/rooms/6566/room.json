      "The branches of ancient fruit trees create an interwoven shelter that gives this part of the garden an intimate ambiance.  A carved stone bench sits before the cliff wall at the back, extending its timeless invitation.  Against the east wall, a stone fish with flared gills and arched tail spits a stream of water into a stone-edged pool choked with green algae."
