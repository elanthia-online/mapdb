      "Heavy and damp, the air is rife with the scent of packed dirt, herbs, and smoke.  Spidery white tendrils, the roots of some unseen plant, dangle from the ceiling between the thick oak beams.  Footsteps dully echo from above as patrons and denizens move through the passage above, the tremors setting the wrought iron basket of coals that hangs in the center of the room to swaying.  A rough wooden table rests against one earthy wall, its contents largely in shadow."
