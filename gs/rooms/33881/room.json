      "Trellises of faenor filaments frame the windows of a grey limestone shop, the entwined lengths covered in a profusion of wine-colored naefira cradled in glossy vert leaves.  Ebony-framed chairs encircle glass-covered tables scattered across the cobblestones, the seating placed beneath the leaf-laden branches of downy oak, their long arms suspending spherical glass lanterns.  Cushion-weighted blankets of maedatha cover the well-manicured grass, the faint scent of florals drifting from the nearby gardens."
