      "The wide trunk of a tree split by lightning serves as the stinking foundation for a thatch nest lined with tattered hides and dried banana leaves.  Dark soot stains the scarred wood, mingling with amber rivulets of sap.  The pungent aroma of rot rises from the belly of the nest, where dull egg fragments mingle with broken carcasses, some of small rodents and birds, but others of larger and more dangerous game."
