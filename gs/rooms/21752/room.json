      "This is a room somewhat larger than most on this floor.  Soft pastel colors adorn the walls and brightly-colored curtains give a warm family atmosphere to the surroundings.  Nearly tripping over a child's rubber rolton, you note that room has been made for a child's bed to one side along with all the myriad items needed to keep one amused and clean."
