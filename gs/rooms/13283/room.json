      "The graceful, ridged form of a dark slate grey arch flows out of the northern wall like a cascade of water forever frozen in time.  A vivid painting of a starling and a hawk flank either side of the arch, a length of dark blue ribbon held aloft by both their talons.  A rounded dark velvet carpet pools outward from the arch, while soft silken curtains shroud its interior from view."
