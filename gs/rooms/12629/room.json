      "This small stone cottage might have been spared the destructive wave of fire, were it not for the wooden roof, which must have exploded in a fiery blaze of heat.  Overhead, charred rafters balance precariously on their moorings.  Great hunks of cinder blanket the room, obscuring whatever furnishings might still remain beneath."
