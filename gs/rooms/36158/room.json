      "A bronze-beaked falcon figurehead adorns the prow of the vessel, its spread metal wings cleaving to the crimson-painted hull.  Wrought from the same metal, a high railing takes the form of a knotted rope supported by sculpted figures of slender men and women spaced about the edges of the deck.  A polished redwood ship's wheel crowns a raised platform several paces behind the metal falcon."
