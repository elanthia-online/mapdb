      "The cold wracks the cliff with ice-laced wind.  A strange rainbow flickers through the cloud cover, tinting the haze in a diffused glow.  The trail rises to the north and seems to disappear into a cloud bank as the way crooks to follow the mountain.  To the south, a large outcrop of rock forces the ledge into a southwest curve around the snowy rock.",

The trail rises to the north and seems to disappear into a cloud bank as the way crooks to follow the mountain.  To the south, a large outcrop of rock forces the ledge into a southwest curve around the snowy rock."
