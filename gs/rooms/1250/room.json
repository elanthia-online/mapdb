      "The hushed silence of this dark, dusty library envelops you.  Though draped with plush curtains, the room is bathed in a soothing golden light.  Atop a reading table, an ancient alchemical treatise in an obscure script lies open, surrounded by quills, parchment and other tools of scholarly research.  A low arch leads east."
