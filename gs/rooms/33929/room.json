      "Luminous yellow crystal blooms twinkle in the dark along this cave's ceiling and walls.  Assemblies of white puffball mushrooms huddle together in patches across a verdant carpet of dewey green moss that covers the floor.  Occasional zephyrs stir the pleasantly cool air, sometimes scattering orange-red clouds of spores that erupt from the odd mushroom cluster."
