      "Cheerfully painted forest and meadow scenes cover the walls, each image lush with florals and greenery and tiny fawns cavorting with butterflies.  Numerous kaleidoscopes of lyshaelyn butterflies on sunshine yellow ribbons twine about a series of copper hooks, and an ebon marble mannequin sits in a jadewood-carved corner bower.  Glittering in the ambient light, a prismatic velvet curtain leads deeper within the shop."
