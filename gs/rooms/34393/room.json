      "Benches line the curved walls of this large, open area, all facing the center where an octagonal wooden stage serves as the focal point for onlookers.  Dangling from the ceiling directly above the stage is a magnificent chandelier.  A stone statue of a penguin stands at each of the four cardinal directions of the arena, serving as silent observers.  Strategically placed furthest away from both an opening with a pair of slatted saloon doors and a large pine door on the opposite end is a refreshments table."
