      "The fresh air and moonlight on the rooftops of the city and the waters of Solhaven Bay to the west create a sense of serenity out here.  Twining ivy covers the wall, and climbing roses shroud the ivory railing.  Pale gardenias sit in the corners in elegant polished vases, their soft fragrance lingering in the night air, and maple leaves lie scattered on the balcony floor from a recent sea breeze.  A narrow set of steps descends from the north end of the balcony to a small garden on the house's north side."
