      "This section of the battlements is clear of rusting metal with the exception of an unadorned flagpole, which is covered in occasional patches of browns and reds.  Nothing shattered nor broken is visible to speak of the violent fall of the fortress, with this section affected only by the warm breezes buffeting the uppermost section of the Citadel.  Twinkling burning violets line the pathway below, their etheral light halting abruptly along the rim of the ravine.",
