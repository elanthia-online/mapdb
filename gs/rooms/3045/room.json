      "A light coating of sand crunches with each step, adding some traction to the icy, slick pathway.  The howl of a nocturnal animal echoes in the night, its lonesome cry continuing unanswered.  Moonlight makes the snow softly glitter here and there and gives it a pale blue cast.",
      "A light coating of sand crunches with each step, adding some traction to the icy, slick pathway.  The loping tracks of a creature trail along for a bit before heading towards the forest.  A young pine tree pushes its way up through the drift, the wiry branches tipped with a slight dusting of snow."
