      "Thick roots line the walls and ceiling of this chamber.  Bones left over from meals lay strewn about, covered with industrious insects, as well as broken pottery and ruined furniture.  The smell of the area leaves much to be desired, as the lack of ventilation and heavy air trap the stench of rotting flesh in the room."
