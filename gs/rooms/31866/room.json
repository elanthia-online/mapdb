      "A dark stone hall sits back from the frozen lake, a crescent of matching stone cottages almost buried in the snow banks along the shore.  The south shore of the lake is engulfed by a dark forest of cedars and briars, the cobblestone path ending at a dark briar arch leading deeper within.  Several hedge animals cover the snow-blanketed ground between the dark forest and the hall."
