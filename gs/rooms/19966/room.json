      "The room is dim, a faint luminescence emanating from a single shelf mounted on the wall that houses several glowing potions under a glass case.  There are small plaques on the shelf in front of each potion, their metal surfaces gleaming in the half-light of the room.  Centrally located, a simmering cast iron cauldron over a magical blue flame sits adjacent to a mortar and pestle that rest on a small pedestal.  A gnarled ebonwood arch leads to the northwest, while an onyx arch leads southwest."
