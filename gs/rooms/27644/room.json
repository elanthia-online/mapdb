      "Positioned opposite an arched and curtained entry, a set of rickety stairs disappears into the ceiling above and is illuminated by the dusty glass lanterns that are anchored to the nearby rough maple wall.  Several pegs follow the slanting line of the stairs and house a variety of items over a long wooden bench that is cluttered with bric-a-brac.  An errant breeze, damp and heavy with the scent of decay, consistently tugs at the fabrics on display."
