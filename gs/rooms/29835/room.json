      "The interior of the building is clearly divided into four quadrants, each one bearing striking symbols and pieces of artwork pertaining to a distinct element.  At the exact center of the room is a pedestal, itself divided into four equal segments.  Torches burn in each of the four quadrants, each illuminating their individual section while also serving to cast light on their neighbors.  Atop the pedestal sits a series of wrought iron hooks.  A heavy drape leads out of the shop."
