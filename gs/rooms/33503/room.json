      "Cut from waxed canvas, an ebon-on-crimson striped awning offers race track viewers protection from the elements.  Jeers and cheers rise up from raised rows of crowded, rough-hewn oak benches positioned behind a more spacious seating area roped off for use only by honored guests.  A stern-faced attendant is positioned nearby, nodding at distinguished onlookers and offering entry to the reserved section."
