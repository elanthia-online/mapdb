      "Surrounded by washed out curtains of crushed velvet, a trio of cloudy windows of stained glass stand guard over niches recessed into the walls.  Pale outlines on the blocky stone walls have large nails in the center, evidence that artwork once was displayed there.  High over head, a cracked candelabra dangles from a frayed rope, its candles scattered and broken upon the floor."
