    "description": [
      "A silver-shot black stone obelisk lies on its side, the etchings on its face gnawed down to faint depressions by the corrosive bite of saltwater.  Vines and moss alike seem to give the fallen monolith a wide berth, though nearly every other stone surface is choked by one or blanketed by the other.  Peeking through a curtain of overgrowth, a sheer cliff face of rock behind the monument is as dark as old blood save where it is threaded with veins of startlingly blue lapis lazuli."
