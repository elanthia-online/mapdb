      "Paneled ivory silk walls are painted in warm-hues detailing a phoenix and stylized flame motifs, the design only stopping to give way to an arched window.  Lodged into a corner, a mahogany bookshelf claims residence, its shelves covered in a number of tomes.  A matte gold leather armchair sits behind a burnished red modwir desk, its surface haphazardly stacked high in paperwork.  A cozy chestnut brown leather couch faces the desk, flanked on either side by tiered end tables hosting refreshments."
