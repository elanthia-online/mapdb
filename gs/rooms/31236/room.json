      "Light moss-hued silk is draped over a sturdy mistwood frame, creating the walls of this spacious tent.  The ceiling is left open, allowing sunlight to stream through to bathe rows of temporary flower beds in a blanket of warmth.  A carved stone bench sits in the center of the area, its surface covered with a display of beads and gems."
