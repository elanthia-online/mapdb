    "description": [
      "Curved, transparent sheets of crystal set at an angle into alabaster walls meet high overhead to enclose the top of the tower.  At the dome's apex, the crystal panes become a single lofty spire.  On one side of the crystalline chamber, a gilded arch opens onto a slender walkway that reaches into the sky without rails or supports.  Opposite the arch is a gold-chased telescope near a low table and scattered lounge chairs that invite stargazing."
