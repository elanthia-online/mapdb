      "Sickly sweet, the odor of rot is a nauseating pall upon the icy breeze wafting from the northwest.  Rough-hewn timber posts support lanterns meant to hold back the perennial twilight, but they are unlit and look as if they have not been tended in some time.  One of the lanterns has fallen free from its hook, and its broken shards glitter unsettlingly in the light of the aurora."
