      "Perched atop a small hillock, an expansive bright white felt ger girded in bright blue and red bands rests on an elevated wooden platform that forms a wide patio encircling the fabric-wrapped structure.  Beneath the platform, shale and shard rock spread in uneven patches where limestone saxifrage grows in dense clusters, its pale blooms and glossy leaves creating a living carpet across the stones.  Extending outward from the large domicile, a line of colorful pennants trails down the slope, each cloth snapping lightly in the breeze, while at the edges of the hillock is a cluster of smooth stones."
