      "Flat and remarkably smooth, the grounds near the wall are littered with broken limbs, brambles, and other debris that passing storms have thrown over the wall.  Covered in a blanket of moss, the remains of a small wooden lean-to rests to one side and defiantly stands against the test of time.  Bottomless buckets, some shattered and others missing their handles, lie in a jumbled heap amid wild patches of overgrown grasses and newly sprouted brambles."
