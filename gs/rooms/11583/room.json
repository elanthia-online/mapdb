      "A large bloodstain is partially hidden by a ship's locker, torn loose by the wreck and smashed against the dented starboard bulkhead.  The thin mattress, flung from the bunk by the impact, has ruptured, scattering wads of cotton ticking throughout the cabin.  A short length of rope tied with a series of knots is coiled on the deck."
