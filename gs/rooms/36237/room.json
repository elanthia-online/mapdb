      "Piles of random papers and books are stacked high, blocking the view of the walls.  Upon the floor, a large map of Elanthia sits taking up the majority of the space here.  Resting on the northwestern corner of the map is a large wyrmwood crate, which is in rough condition.  Empty bottles and cans are thrown all over the place, leaving little room to walk around."
