      "A large bonfire has been set up in this area, and is strategically located underneath a breach in the overhead canopy.  A series of wooden tables and benches has been arranged around the bonfire, and a flop-eared puppy works its way around from table to table on an endlessly hopeful circuit.  A stack of cut firewood stands off to one side, ready to keep the bonfire stoked should it start to flag."
