      "The path continues to a small, tranquil pond that rests behind one of the shops to the south.  Bull frogs croak loudly from somewhere unseen, and bright orange and white fish swim happily beneath the surface of the water.  A dense line of trees combine with a thick series of rose bushes to surround the outer edges of the pond, cutting it off from the rest of the village."
