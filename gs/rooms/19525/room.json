      "A row of small windows line the white-washed walls of the small entry room, their clear glass panes bringing profuse sunlight inside.  The tranquil views of the verdant courtyard outside only add to the serene atmosphere within.  Several identical narrow passageways lead toward the interior of the cottage.",
