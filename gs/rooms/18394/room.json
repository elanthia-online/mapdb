      "Sweet-smelling smoke permeates the air, creating a light haze throughout the building.  Wide windows peer out at the town's street, their frames glossed over with a thick lacquer.  Leaning up against the glossy, gnarled wooden walls are several rustic benches positioned across from a long counter laden with merchandise.  A framed painting of an aged man with white stubble and a twinkle in his blue eyes is the only hanging decoration in sight."
