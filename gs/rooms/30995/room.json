      "Dividing the elongated room into different browsing sections, a narrow dark koa table stretches across the center of the marble-tiled floors.  The eastern wall supports a gold-framed shelf, an iron-banded trunk, and a notched maoral ledge, while the western wall stores a carved rowan case and a heavy walnut jewelry box.  Numerous pots of wild greenery are scattered throughout the area, and an elusive, slightly metallic charred scent winds through the air."
