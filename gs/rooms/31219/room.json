      "The thick oak walls that make up this split-level hideaway are adorned in mystical elven patterns.  The bed, on the upper level, is enormously oversized and drowned in fresh silks.  Two steps down, windows of etched glass line the outer wall, while cushions at their base provide a spot for rest.  At the base of the steps are large bookcases, home to volumes of novels and books of history.  An old overstuffed chair sits in the corner."
