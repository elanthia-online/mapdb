      "The planks on this section of the huge barrel-raft of the town are unusually thick and well maintained.  This may be due to the large pier to the south.  A number of larger ships dock there, and crewmen busy themselves moving barrels and crates from ship to shore and shore to ship.  The majority of Marshtown lies to the northeast."
