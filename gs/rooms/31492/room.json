      "Bronze lanterns hang to either side of a large hand-drawn chart that is placed above a massive carved mahogany bed.  A narrow writing desk topped with a variety of quills and partially drawn maps is tucked in a corner.  Flecks of warm colors are woven into the wool rug that lines the dark plank floor beneath an exposed beam ceiling.  A pair of cushioned wooden chairs is positioned about an ebon marble fireplace, with a basket of sticks placed nearby."
