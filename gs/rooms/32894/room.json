      "Abutting the Old Ward Wall to the east, a wide cobblestoned thoroughfare departs from the warehouse district towards the various markets of Brisker's Cove.  Tufted hairgrass, largely in shades of yellowish-white with clusters of bright green in the center, rise around desert willows planted along a narrow runnel that separates the street from the wall.  The edges of a sprawling shipyard spill from the south, their distant edges stretching towards the Fisherman's Docks on the eastern shores."
