      "Cresting the gentle incline, blue-green grass mingles with the tendrils of warm mist that trickles in from the west.  Wildflowers of the bright yellow and purple variety bring splashes of color to the meadow, while twin conifers rise tall and proud near the center.  A thin stream slips through the area, its moving waters carrying leaves and grass blades northward."
