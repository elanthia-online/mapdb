      "Varnished ebonwood walls rise from a speckled black marble floor.  Just above an open-mawed greater vruul statue hangs a portrait of Darkstone Castle, and a vaulted ceiling completes the picture.  A iron-bound ebonwood chest and a gold-veined black marble counter stand side by side in the middle of the room."
