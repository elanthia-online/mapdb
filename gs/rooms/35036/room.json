      "A dull roar in the air clashes with the screeching of the wind, as if the earth is moaning in desperation.  The sound emanates from dozens of gashes in the earth, from which erupt billows of hot, sulphurous steam.  Beyond the odor of rotting eggs, the smell of molten rock is heavy on the air and inescapable."
