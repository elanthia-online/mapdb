      "Long shadows creep out from under shop awnings, and mud-covered ice is pushed into mounds on either side of the packing-crate pavement.  A halfling merchant holds up two pieces of jewelry to a potential customer, who offers an ivory dagger in exchange.  The wary merchant keeps a close eye on the customer's small child, who keeps trying to enter the shop without supervision.",
      "Darkness fills this quiet alley, and mud-covered ice is pushed into mounds on either side of the packing-crate pavement.  Wagons move slowly through the area, delivering goods to the shops and kiosks whose colorful awnings brighten this moonlit edge of town."
