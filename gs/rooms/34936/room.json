      "A diminutive cast iron stove stands in the corner of the shop, the aged oven framed by a pair of branch-like perches covered in colorful threads.  Twisted roots are crafted into makeshift shelves along the velvet-draped walls, each one decorated with a variety of powder-filled jars and knickknacks draping down the edges.  Tall hand-painted curios stand against the walls, the compartments filled with skeins of vibrant yarn alongside several unfinished projects."
