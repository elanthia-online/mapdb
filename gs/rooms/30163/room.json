      "Black-eyed daisies with bright yellow petals sprout from the long tufts of grass that grow around the posts of a whitewashed fence that encircles a grassy pasture.  Towering modwirs provide pockets of shade along the edges of the field, the reaching limbs brushing the roof of a nearby stable whose large stable doors gleam in the sunlight.  Twin lanterns clutched in the feet of rosin meadowlarks reflect prismatic light from their perch to either side of an angled staircase that leads to the stable's second story.",
