      "Hunter green and ebon bourde fabric decorates the walls of the sitting room, the colorful fabric threaded with thin gold wire that reflects the lights of the nearby scones.  Several settees of polished dark walnut are arranged through the space and covered with lush velveteen in complimentary hues.  A dark carpet stretches across the floor, its surface dappled in sodden footprints that trail to and from a pair of glass-paned doors."
