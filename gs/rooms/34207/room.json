      "Sprawling veins of pink granite flecked with mica wind through the rutted stone.  Above, tiny eggs threaten to overflow a long, mossy cavity set high in the broad tunnel wall, the ruddy spheres glistening and clinging fast to both their fellows and the stone lip of their cradle.  A chalky white crust of dried secretions extends down from the egg shelf, striping the wall."
