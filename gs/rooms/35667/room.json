    "description": [
      "The keel of a wreck juts out of the floating debris like the exposed spine of a long-dead sea creature, its fractured beams twisted and buckled by the sea's constant onslaught.  Mussels cling, big and black, to the warped wood, and a haze of iridescent foam clings to the wood with a tenacity that even the waves cannot overcome.  The rhythmic slap of the waves against the hull echoes hollowly, as if the ocean is playing a great, mournful drum."
