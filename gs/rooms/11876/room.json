      "The water sits unmoving in this stretch of tunnel, its green glow muted by a layer of scum that has accumulated on the surface.  Apparently the water hasn't moved in a long time.  On the southern wall, the granite has been replaced by brickwork, as if someone had sealed off another tunnel.  Though aged, the brick and its surrounding mortar are still solid and unyielding."
