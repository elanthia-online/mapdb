      "The subtle smell of old blood lingers in the air as dried pools of the sanguineous substance, along with various drips, mar the already damaged wood floors.  A series of hangers hang from rusted hooks protruding from soiled walls, with small oil lanterns between them.  Resting against a far wall is a pine table, its surface bare save for a few scraps of paper."
