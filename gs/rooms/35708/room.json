    "description": [
      "A broad terrace of crudely hewn planks clinging to the bole of a great kapok appears to be a communal feasting spot, judging from the splintered bones and scraps of dried meat littering the wood.  Unclean pottery is scattered across salt-stained rugs that look to have been the provenance of a long-ago shipwreck.  Dense foliage hangs low over the space, muffling sounds from below and casting the surroundings into deep shadow."
