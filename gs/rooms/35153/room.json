      "Ancient tapestries in the Ashrim style hang from the walls near the a white ash door leading into the guildmaster's office, both depicting battles between tall ships and sea monsters that look more the product of an evening's fancies than nature.  Sitting atop a desk of black walnut, a glimaerstone lamp with gnomish markings bathes the study in even light.  The wall opposite the doorway holds a timeworn ship's wheel that looks heavily stained with salt and smoothed by the touch of countless hands."
