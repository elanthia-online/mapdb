      "A small stone birdbath resides in the center of the clearing, its statuary carved in the fanciful image of a playful drake swooping down into the water contained within its bowl.  Fat yellow bumblebees whir about the nearby butterfly bushes and deep red verbena.",
      "Several lanterns hung from the boughs of a nearby tree cast dim light across the clearing.  A small stone birdbath resides in the center of the grass, its statuary carved in the fanciful image of a playful drake swooping down into the water contained within its bowl.  The chirping of crickets and quiet croaking of frogs is all that disturbs the peaceful night air.",
