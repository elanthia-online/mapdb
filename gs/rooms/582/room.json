      "Escorted by the faint sound of a stream, the path climbs through a cascade of large boulders.  The trees still maintain a full coverage of foliage overhead, growing resolutely up out of the rocky jumble.  Silvery green lichens create a lacy pattern on the fieldstones, which glows slightly in the faint moonlight.",

Silvery green lichens create a lacy pattern on the fieldstones, contrasted by the subtle striations within the stone."
