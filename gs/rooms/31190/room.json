      "Sturdy oak beams frame the lean-to and its roof, while heavy taupe oilcloth hangs in weighty lengths over the top and down the sides.  Expertly tanned hides and pelts line the interior, adding insulation to protect the heat rising from the small wood heater tucked into the corner.  A single, double-sided knife display sits directly in the center of the space, with each end adorned with an anatomical dissection chart, detailed with artist renderings of various animals."
