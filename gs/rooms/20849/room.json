      "The open staircase hugs the wall, providing a dizzying view up into the heights of the tower.  The stair stops at a small landing at which several doors are set into the stone wall, then continues up in a steep spiral.  The glossy obsidian steps are each set with a slightly raised rolaren symbol that provides a safe grip on the slick stairs."
