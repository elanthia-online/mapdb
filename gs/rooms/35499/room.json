      "Pole-affixed clusters of vylithen-crafted booths are scattered across the boardwalk, the stands showcasing baskets of fresh produce and baked goods alongside stacks of knitted wares.  Tall resaeun counters are placed close to a gingham cloth-lined pale wicker basket and a glass-domed circular linden pedestal, each raw-edged table shaded by an expansive naefira-painted umbrella angled towards the waters."
