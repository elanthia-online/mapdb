      "Long, rolling inclines elevate the path above the bog here, providing the little remaining life in the bog a chance to cling to soil.  The path is hedged in very tightly on either side by dense copses of sickly thorn bushes and gnarled, bent trees.  Grey leaves, splattered with mud, stretch in futility toward a sun obscured by fogs and mists.",
