      "Tidy and spartan, the barracks have four sets of wrought iron bunks built into the walls.  Equally as many equipment lockers are scattered about the space, while foul weather gear for each guard hangs from pegs near the door.  A duty roster is tacked to the northern wall, the tidy writing listing the rotation schedule that is shared with the Kraken's Fall jailhouse."
