      "The auditorium is cavernous, and every inch of the curved ceiling appears to be covered in vividly colored frescos.  The walls are a combination of polished mahogany and painted panels that equal the ceiling in decoration.  Tiers of seats descend toward a stage at the hall's far end, their ranks upholstered in crimson velvet that matches red carpet runners traversing the aisles between them.  A row of small lanterns illuminates the front of the stage."
