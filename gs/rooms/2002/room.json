      "The massive trees of Greymist begin to give way to willows, as solid ground yields to a muddy black silt that threatens to snatch boots off with every step.  Through the dangling branches of the willows, one can barely see a spit extending out into the moonlit sea to the west.  To the south, the inviting water of a large lagoon is visible.",
