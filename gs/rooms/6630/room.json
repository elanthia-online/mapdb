      "This cramped, dark space appears to have once been a storage area for whoever worked in the workshop beyond the curtain.  Cobwebs and dust cover everything in a thick blanket and the shattered remains of shelves line the walls, now devoid of any treasures they may have once held.  A heavy iron-bound strongbox stands alone in one corner."
