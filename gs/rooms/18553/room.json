      "A tendril of dark-vined jasmine has taken root at the base of one of the nearby fence posts and wound its way upward, twisting and knotting itself along the rails.  The vivid yellow flowers that populate the plant release a thickly sweet scent into the air that overpowers everything else nearby.  Even the wildflowers that grow in the expansive meadow beyond the fence offer no competition."
