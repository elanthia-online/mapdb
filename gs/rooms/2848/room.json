    "description": [
      "Verdant and clad in fresh snowfall, the dense pine forest gives way to a large clearing near the mouth of a high pass.  Marking the perimeters of the glade are singularly immense totems carved from pine, their features weathered by the onslaught of the northern gale.  Each of the totems bears a different face, but all stare mutely, patiently standing watch despite the grinding of time's cruel teeth.  The largest is immense, several times the height of a tall man, but most are merely huge and imposing.",
      "The forest gives way to a large natural clearing to the west. Standing in front of you are two totems, primitive looking, but skillfully carved. The faces on the totems stare mutely, patiently waiting and watching you."
