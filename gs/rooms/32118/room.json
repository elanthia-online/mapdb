      "An ancient, petrified tree extends high over the dilapidated end of a fungus-laden rotted fishing dock underfoot.  Massive and towering, the tree stands guard above an amassed collection of sedimentary sludge where the waters of the stream are forced through compacted brambles and mangroves.  Oily patches near the dock shift on their own accord, a flickering shadowy reflection momentarily appearing at each glance."
