      "Beyond widespread gates of bronze, apricot trees flourish around the perimeters of the lush garden, their pendulous fruits swaying languidly in the breeze.  Orchids sprout from fertile soil amidst densely overgrown shrubs.  Tantalizing glimpses through the greenery hint at intricately carved statues of jade depicting intertwining humanoid forms that mark a winding path toward a temple of milky green marble."
