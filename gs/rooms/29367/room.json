      "The cylindrical glassed-in structure is supported by vertical bars of gleaming vultite and crowned with an intricate cupola roof.  Dominating the majority of the space, an immense adamantine-framed crystalline lens is brightly illumined by a flock of glowing white gold lanterns.  Tucked into a narrow outer corridor, a rainbow glaes-paned door sits next to some winding stairs that descend back to the pub below."
