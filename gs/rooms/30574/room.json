      "Warm oak paneling covers the walls of this small building.  Windows, one each mounted in the north, west and east walls, allow sunlight to brighten the interior.  The ceiling and floor are both composed of white limestone, reflecting the sunlight and adding to the illumination.  A carved walnut desk occupies a prominent position behind which a large, padded chair resides.  Two torches flank the silver door on the south wall.",
