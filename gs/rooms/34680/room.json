      "Stained glass windows cast shards of colored light on the gold-tasseled scarlet runner as it approaches a long thanot counter, behind which sit clerks in formal attire.  Several are busy counting piles of gold and silver coins, some with strange shapes like hexagons and squares.  One has platinum tradebars stacked before him."
