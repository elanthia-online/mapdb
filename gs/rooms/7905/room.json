      "This shallow tunnel stops at a dead end.  If you examine the far wall, you will notice that the tunnel used to go through -- it looks like fresh lava came bubbling up to this point, then hardened.  Towards the ground is a small crack.  You look around, wondering exactly how stable this mountain is."
