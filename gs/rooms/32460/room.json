      "At the aisle's end, red-upholstered chairs fan out before the foot of a wide, crescent-shaped stage, providing ample but intimate seating.  Chandeliers of gold, diamond, and garnet hang from the high ceiling, their glittering adornments reflecting a constellation of colored lights on the walls.  Near to the steps leading up to the stage is a small door."
