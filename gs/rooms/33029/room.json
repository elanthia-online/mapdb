      "Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves partition parchment-hued walls above aged boxwood parquet, creating a discreet nook arranged with a pair of distressed leather wingback chairs and a low copper leaf table.  Beneath a floriated brass chandelier set with stained glass globes, an oversized pale leather sofa stretches out in front of a stone fireplace, its hearth strewn with soft woolen rugs and goose feather pillows.  A framed slate blackboard is positioned near a curtained opening."
