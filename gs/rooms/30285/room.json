      "Faint light from the street outside filters into the room through the a large oak-framed window, providing scant illumination for a pair of paintings hanging upon one wall.  Numerous large sacks, packages, and crates are stacked and organized behind a long wooden counter that dominates the back and side walls.  A pair of glass hurricane lanterns hang from the ceiling, casting soft light across the room.",
