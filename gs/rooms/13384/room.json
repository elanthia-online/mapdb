      "Sapphire-sheen draperies cover the windows, shielding the numerous felt-covered tables from any prying eyes.  A small, intricately patterned chandelier hangs from the ceiling, its translucent sapphire panes casting a lovely glow across the surroundings.  A deep crimson rug covers the floor, its velvety sheen traced with twining patterns of ivy and other delicate, flowered vines."
