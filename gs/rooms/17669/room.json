      "The street dead-ends into a cul-de-sac surrounded by wooden buildings in various states of disrepair.  A large gallows stands at the end of the cul-de-sac, and behind it sits a gateway guarded by two tall men in mismatching armor.  Men and women gather by a ragged stall and fill the air with raucous laughs and profane language, while a group of dirty children race excitedly about chasing a large dock rat.",
