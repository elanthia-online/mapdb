      "Smoothed timbers of fruitwood trees are lashed together into a frame and floor for this sturdy, elevated booth, upon which myriad weapons are hung for display.  Superbly masoned river stone half-walls are capped by windowed sections of lattice, arranged between upright, carved stone pillars at the booth's two furthest ends.  A bead-shrouded opening at either end provides one way in and one way out, each angled toward the bustling market of Kragnek Dzu."
