      "Although the forest is visible on the horizon to the south, there is no way of getting there across the treacherous swamp in between.  Slowly the swamp seems to be reclaiming the cobblestone road, leaving less than half the cobblestones even visible in this area.  To the west the black water has completely covered the roadway, and to the east the roadway dips and jogs, fighting to stay above the sinking terrain."
