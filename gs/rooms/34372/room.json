    "description": [
      "Sizeable water droplets rain down upon everything beneath the persistant seepage and leave a layer of moisture along the ground coupled with a thick, suffocating humidity in the air.  Deep incisions are noticeable along the granite walls, scratched in patterns generated by enormous clawed paws that have swept across the stone.  Strong vibrations shake the earth underfoot and are followed by an extended series of muffled rumblings, though they seem to be originating from outside the caves."
