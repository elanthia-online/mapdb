      "Devoid of all furnishings, save for a glass and brass display case pushed against the eastern wall, the small niche seems unscathed by the destruction displayed in other parts of the tower.  Dust bunnies have collected in the corners and a fine layer of soot has settled over the cobblestones causing the scene to resemble a meadow beneath new-fallen snow."
