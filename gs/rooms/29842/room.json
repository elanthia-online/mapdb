      "Sheer, black gossamer painted with small, silver moons and stars hang across loosely planked walls in a poor attempt to dress up the room.  Soft light from several mostly melted candles reflects upon the moons and stars on the fabric, creating the illusion of dancing fireflies in the dim room.  A leather-bound chest, its lid propped open by a pronged pole, sits off to one side of the area across from a pine closet with its door broken off the hinges."
