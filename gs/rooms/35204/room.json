      "Wrapped in the warm embrace of dark maplewood wainscoting, this room invites the intrepid adventurer to rest.  Comfortable puma-hide couches form an open square facing a silver-veined white marble hearth, above which is set a maple-framed silver looking-glass.  Along one wall, flanked by two green banners displaying silver dragons, a well-stocked bar offers refreshment to the thirsty.  A silver-edged green faenor medallion is set at the apex of the soulstone studded arch leading into the room."
