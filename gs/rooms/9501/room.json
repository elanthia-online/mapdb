      "A wide, gold-trimmed window looks out into the Sapphire Tunnel.  The faces of dwarven children are occasionally pressed against the glass as they admire the wares within.  Displayed on a polished granite shelf in the window is a breathtaking assortment of chocolates.  A long glaes counter also holds an assortment of mouthwatering delectables.  The savory scents of chocolate and other goodies permeates the air."
