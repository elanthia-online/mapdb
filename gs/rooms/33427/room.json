      "Isolated from the beach, the soft sands are set back from the rollicking surf and sheltered by the curve of the land.  Ocean water glides into the air through breaks in the surrounding walks, which keeps the clam beds hydrated and fresh.  A large boulder, its base draped in seaweed and its sides splattered in seafoam, acts as a breakpoint between the soft sand and the tide."
