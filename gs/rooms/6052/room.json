      "The wind, combined with heavy rains, has wreaked some havoc among the corn stalks in this area of the field.  Dozens of stalks have been blown over to block the areas between the rows.  Caution must be used to step over and between them when proceeding.  Some are already raising themselves back toward an upright position, while others have compensated by sending new growth upward from the main stalk's reclining position."
