      "A stylized fang in opalescent inlay shines from the face of the honey oak door.  The motif is repeated in the carvings on the posts of a huge four-poster bed draped in supple amber curtains.  Opposite a trio of bay windows that overlook the glade is a dark stone fireplace.  Several porcelain statues of wolves prowl along the mantel."
