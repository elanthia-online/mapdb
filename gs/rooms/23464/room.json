      "Dozens of lanterns hang from the ceiling, holding dozens of flickering candles.  The light fills the room with radiance as it bounces off the gemstones adorning the jewelry on display.  A wooden treasure chest with brass hinges rests beneath the branches of a miniature white monir tree.  A three-legged stool sits near the door, upon which a singed parchment has been tacked."
