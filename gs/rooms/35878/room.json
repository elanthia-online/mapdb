      "The cobblestones abruptly end where a massive glaes dais is anchored into the ground beneath its center, and supported around its circumference by uniform, grey granite pillars.  A towering grove of mistwood trees form a dense barrier around the dais, interspersed with thick brambles and patches of wild flora."
