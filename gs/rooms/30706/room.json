      "A carved, wooden kobold has been nailed to the center of this otherwise unadorned round table.  The kobold is brandishing a short sword menacingly, and a small crown can be made out on its tiny head.  The carving is so poorly done that the kobold is only barely identifiable.  Wooden chairs sized for all races surround the table."
