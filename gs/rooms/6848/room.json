      "Atop a lonely hill sits a massive granite figure.  The great stone colossus sits astride the tumbled rocks of the mount like a king enthroned.  His reign has been a tragic one, and both feet, as well as his left arm, have long since crumbled away.  He sternly surveys the lands to the south, no doubt contemplating how to regain the lost glory of his dominion.",
