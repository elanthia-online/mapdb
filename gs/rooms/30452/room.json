      "The vivid blue water flows to and fro between the distant island jetty and the equally distant pillars of Charl's Teeth.  An occasional fish disturbs the surface of the glittering water, a brief break from the endless expanse of ocean that stretches on seemingly forever.  Shadowy clouds pass overhead, alternatively obscuring and revealing the shafts of moonlight that illuminate the otherwise absolute blackness of night."
