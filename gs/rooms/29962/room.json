      "As the high-walled corridor curves toward the northwest, the statues give way to painted effigies along the walls.  Flaking and faded with time, the pigments mimic the colors of the aurora, unearthly greens and dazzling blues picking out scenes of death and battle.  A smear of brighter, newer red bisects the ancient paintings, marring their flow."
