      "Jagged fingers of metal point from the walls and roof at a thousand angles like a mob of kobolds asked to give directions.  The ground is awash with rodent urine and there are more squirrel pellets piled across the sodden ground than gems in an archmage's coffers.  If you lived here, you'd have a bad attitude too."
