      "Several townhouses stand along the cobblestone street.  Their neatly manicured yards are home to fine-looking statuary, and all are kept meticulously clear of snow, suggesting that they are the residences of well-to-do merchants and other luminaries of the town.  Smaller homes front a nearby alley, while an arched gate leads to a less prosperous neighborhood lazing beneath the town's outer wall.  A young halfling girl sweeps the walk in front of one of the homes, hurrying to complete her daily chores.",
      "Several simple houses line the road here, providing homes for merchants and businessmen of the Trace.  Towering high behind them, the town wall provides protection from the wilds beyond.  A young halfling boy sweeps the walk in front of one of the homes, hurrying to complete his daily chore."
