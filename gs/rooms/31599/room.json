      "A duo of cats prowl along the lacquered mahogany counter running the length of the shop, nonchalantly tipping small piles of jewelry and gemstones to the wood-planked floor behind them.  An ethereal jewel-laden spectre mutters to itself as it attempts to reorganize the treasures, gently chastising its feline companions in half-hearted fashion.  The faint clatter of chains and bangles echo through the shop as the spirit moves about, gesturing as a small quill and parchment records its haul."
