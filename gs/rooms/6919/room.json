      "The tunnel has long since fallen into disrepair and neglect.  The wooden shoring is rotting and cracked, only adding to the danger it is supposed to eliminate, and the nearly total lack of light makes movement difficult.  Only a single fitful candle stuck onto a fallen beam provides anything to see by."
