      "Ancient pikes still form a lethal barricade, most of the wooden handles rotting in the frosty floor beneath them.  Many of the tips bear long-darkened stains, lending evidence to the fact that the weapons probably served their purpose well.  One point bears an old set of ragged leather impaled upon it, the armor long empty of life."
