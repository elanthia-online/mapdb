      "Cracked wooden barrels lean against the wrecked railing of the gunnel, their spouts rusted over.  They release a sour scent of wine that has run to vinegar and worse, and the warped deck planking around them is stained a striking burgundy.  Overhead, tattered sails rumble in the breeze, accompanied by the creaky commentary of lines that have begun to fray amid the battering of the elements."
