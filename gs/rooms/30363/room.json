      "Distantly the barking of sea thraks can be heard coming from the east, echoing across the calm dark water.  The lights of a well-lit dock are visible, a towering cliff wall behind them.  Dark jungle vegetation makes a stunning contrast to the moonlit white beaches of a large lagoon that lies to the north."
