      "The muddy road follows a wooden post and rail fence as it turns sharply from the east to the northwest.  Untended fields stretch out to the southwest, filled with patches of maize, pumpkins, beans, and weeds that each struggle for dominance.  The stench of decay lies in the air, and carrion birds caw with reckless abandon from somewhere nearby."
