    "description": [
      "Mosquitos buzz as they skim the surface of the water in the cool night air, taking a reprieve from the sweltering heat present during the day.  Shadows dance across the black surface of the water, broken only by moonlight glistening here and there on the rippling liquid.",
      "The occasional bloom floats along on the constantly lapping current of the lagoon, swept into the cove by the waterfall's motions.  The depths of the water are so extensive that it is impossible to touch the lagoon bed, and the liquid becomes so dark of a blue further down that it cannot be seen either.  Only the random flash of silver scales as a fish darts breaks the shadows."
