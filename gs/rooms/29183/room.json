      "Any progress north is impossible due to a sheer drop-off caused by a cave-in along the trail.  Further to the north, the crater rim continues to wrap itself around the lake of magma.  To the east, the waters of Solhaven Bay sparkle in the sunlight, with ships dotting the coastline of the port town."
