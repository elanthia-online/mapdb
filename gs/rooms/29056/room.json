    "description": [
      "A jagged pathway from below winds through a series of towering rocks, ending abruptly at the open maw of an enormous cavern.  Tall trees draped with thorny vines grow to either side of the cave entrance.  Lush greenery, a cascading waterfall, and the red-orange glow of molten rock can be seen beside large promontories jutting from the mountain above the cave.  The earthy fragrance of the forest blends harmoniously with the gentle breeze of salty sea air."
