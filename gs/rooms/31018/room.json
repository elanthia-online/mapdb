      "Twilight blue paint adorns the walls and ceilings of this small room, while the floor underfoot is a slightly paler shade.  In the far corner, a full silvery white moon stares down on the merchandise, while the rest of the sky is starless.  The only other celestial body in the painted sky is a streaking comet, stroked with shades of violet, magenta, emerald, and sapphire.  Miniature orbs of light are inlaid along the comet's streaked tail, brightening the dark sky."
