      "Iron sconces along the wall grasp burning torches that radiate their light in this section of the complex.  Ingots of various metals have been stacked along the granite wall behind an ironwood table dominated by a large brass scale.  A simple iron anvil rests behind the table that looks more like a place to sit due to the lack of any scuff marks or tools nearby."
