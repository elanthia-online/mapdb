      "Once a narrow slot canyon created by tectonic thrust and eons of exposure to the elements, this narrow alley is now just wide enough to support foot traffic and small carts.  Colorful silk banners span the overhead gap and flutter in the night breeze as flickering torchlight brightens the passageway, illuminating their brilliant colors.",
