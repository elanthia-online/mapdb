      "The tunnel turns here, as Glaes and Dragonstail meet.  One building stands out, a large, black granite structure.  A staircase of grey and white marble leads up to the mithril gates, which are flanked by a pair of stone manticores.  The dwarves who amble in and out look to be prosperous sorts."
