      "Smooth pine boards varnished to a golden shine line the floor and walls of the small, yet airy market.  A trio of bronze lanterns hang from the ceiling, their glaesineth orbs etched in detail with a series of wildflowers.  Canisters, crockery, and jars fill deep shelves set up about the room, while painted bins filled with sacks and bags are stacked neatly underneath.  Detailed watercolors illustrating a wide variety of local herbs are hung between the goods on display."
