      "The rounded top of a beavers' lodge extends from the edge of the bank out into the muddy water of the river.  A few small bushes push up through the weave of tree branches, mud and marsh grass from which the structure was constructed.  The path all around the little dwelling is smooth and firmly packed, as if it too has been subjected to the ministrations of the industrious owner of the lodge."
