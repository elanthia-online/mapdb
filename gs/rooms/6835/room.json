      "You stand atop a low, rolling hill.  Green waves of grass and trees stretch back towards the higher hills that cradle this low clearing around the old inn.  From this vantage point, you can survey the inn and its grounds, the decaying roof, the smashed windows, the empty courtyard.  The wind whistles softly, forlornly, through the ruins and twists and eddies around you, causing the foliage to dance.",
