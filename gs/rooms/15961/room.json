    "description": [
      "The meadow stretches almost to the feet of an imposing bluff on the northwest perimeter, its base guarded by a thick border of pines.  Cottages are built within the trees, most facing out toward the snow field and the distant silhouette of Pinefar Lodge where pinpoints of light shine merrily from its many windows.  Snow flurries cross the drifts, luring up cascades of ice particles which move like drifting banks of fog."
