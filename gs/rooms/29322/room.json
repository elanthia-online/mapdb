      "Overlapping, salt-stained sailcloth panels line the high walls of the canopied area, the stony, sand-swept grounds littered with errant tendrils of curling seaweed.  A bleached driftwood case rests upon a knotted cotton carpet, behind a smaller area used for displaying wares that houses a dusky sandstone cabinet and a spindly smoky quartz rack.  Suspended overhead, an artfully tangled installation of ghostly white coral is hung at the center of the room."
