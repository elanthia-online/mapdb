      "This circular room was probably once living quarters.  Now however, it's in a shambles, with broken pieces of furnishings cluttering the floor.  The remains of heavy draperies -- now tattered -- hang from the towering windows, like shrouds hanging off of a graveyard mummy.  A cold wind blows through, making the strips flutter hopelessly in the half-light.  A hazardous-looking staircase winds up to the floor above."
