    "description": [
      "Moonlit water breaks lightly against the white limestone jetty, though it shows signs of having protected the harbor from much stronger forces in the past.  Visible beneath the surface of the water, the sea floor shimmers with golden specks resembling a collection of gold coins as their vivid light breaks through the shadowy depths.  An occasional silver fish darts through the murky water, its scales caught in a shaft of moonlight penetrating the liquid enough to briefly illuminate the tiny creature."
