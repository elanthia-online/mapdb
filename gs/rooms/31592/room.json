      "Surrounded by bright lanterns, a sprawling manor gazes upon the open canal and bridges with dark windows and shadowed gables.  Blue-green grasses decorate the lawn, growing duskier the further they are from the violet-sheened light, while bushes dabbled with blossoms form a corridor leading to the manor's entry.  A well-trodden cobblestone pathway cuts through the streets to the east of the structure, while a dull green moss-covered stone arch connects the manor to its nearest neighbor."
