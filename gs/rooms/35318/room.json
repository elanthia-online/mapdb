      "White marble walls and gilded accents lend a sense of refinement to the chamber, where several teller booths stand in a neat row.  A large black oak-framed painting dominates one wall, depicting a vast glacier with an outpost nestled at its edge, its icy expanse rendered in sharp, crisp strokes.  Opposite the painting, a grand brass chandelier hangs from the high ceiling, its curved arms supporting frosted glass globes that diffuse a soft, even glow throughout the space."
