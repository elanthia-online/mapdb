      "Roughly carved out of the stone, this small grotto chamber is humid and dark.  Pushed up against the stone walls and wet from the water dripping down those same walls, a series of driftwood crates are stacked in piles of varying heights.  Hanging overhead, a series of metal lanterns are coated with timeworn rust.  A broad stone arch leads back toward the grotto's arena."
