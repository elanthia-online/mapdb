      "Tall buildings uniformly line both sides of the tessellated pavement.  Each building has a shadowy entrance with a guard at the door.  Behind the length of the buildings is a sea garden with colorful rocks, sea shells, and carved driftwood.  Several privately enclosed altars have been nestled into the gardens for the personal use of the residents.  A centrally located merchant sits in front of a gold trimmed aviary with a view of the water behind him."
