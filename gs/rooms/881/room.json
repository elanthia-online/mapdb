    "description": [
      "A gentle gurgling sound dances between the narrow walls of the pass, its source a natural spring lying near the base of one of them.  Moss-coated and entangled with small, but lush vegetation, the narrow fissure in the rock issues forth a steady trickle of fresh water, which flows into a small pool.  The area around the trapped water is spotted with small animal tracks, as if this place were a favorite watering hole for the denizens of the pass."
