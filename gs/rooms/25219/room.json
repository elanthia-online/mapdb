      "A crumbling watchtower breaches up through the red-orange expanse of the desert like a broken finger.  Unremitting onslaughts from the sands and wind have dwindled the stone building down to a grey and pockmarked nub, and transformed its windows to dark and haunted eyes overlooking an insatiable and all-consuming landscape.  A doorway, little more than a gaping chasm, yawns from the base of the ruin."
