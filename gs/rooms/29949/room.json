      "Glimpses of a vast fane of stone glint through the a break in the monochrome of the snow-clad trees, its cyclopean architecture the color of dried blood in the twilight.  Above it, the aurora shimmers with tortured crimsons and jaundiced yellows.  There is a hush to the woodland, as if bird and beast are but distant memories.  A dirt path through the woods, hard-packed by the passage of countless travelers and aglisten with frost, winds northwestward on its way to the distant edifice."
