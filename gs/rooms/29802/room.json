      "[Willow Lodge, Clearing]"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Cloaked in frost-covered moss, a low cobblestone wall separates tall snow-laden pine trees from a courtyard cleared of snow.  The area is sheltered from the howling winds by the surrounding conifers.  A well trodden path leads from within the trees, circuitously around a large fire pit ringed with smooth stone benches, and up to a sturdy wooden lodge.  Behind the lodge, a footpath leads down to a rickety fishing shanty at the end of a sagging, wooden dock jutting into an ice-covered pond."
