      "Brilliantly lit by torches hung in sconces along the walls, the hallway has a vaulting ceiling painted with aged frescos of victorious combat.  It proceeds toward a great portcullis of ironwood reinforced with black and gold vultite.  From beyond, the roar of the arena calls.  Alcoves spaced along the walls hold suits of polished armor, though one arched opening in the western wall houses a broad flight of marble steps ascending to the stands."
