      "Three narrow windows, placed halfway up the wall, provide the illumination for the polished granite-floored and walled room via three streams of moonlight.  A small niche in the corner is both the setting for a small altar and also the only decoration other than a dark wood workbench and assorted alchemic instruments.  The liquid sounds of a slow moving river carry in from outside through the windows, accompanied by a slight breeze rich with the aroma of wet earth and sweet smelling blossoms.",
