      "Various equipment is spread out amongst four expansive workstations located in each corner of the room.  Discarded projects are scattered between scorch marks and other oddly discolored areas.  Curiously suspended in midair, a sizeable blue sphere hovers above, its smooth surface giving off a pale blue light.  Numerous grates are installed into the walls and ceiling, the largest set in the floor at the direct center of the workshop.  A thick iron lever is recessed into the stone next to a glowing archway."
