      "Large bamboo-framed partitions divide the large pavilion into sections, which are each illuminated by glass-encased lanterns.  Heavy ebon drapes form the conical ceiling and offer a subtle, textural contrast to the thick rugs that are layered upon the ground.  Arranged in the center of the small space is a round table covered with a white cloth."
