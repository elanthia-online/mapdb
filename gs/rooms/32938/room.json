      "Backed by a stockade fence, the small, packed-dirt yard is devoid of any kind of growth.  Barrels with copper, iron, or bronze hoops are stacked in three of the space's four corners, while the fourth holds an old trough of discarded materials.  The sound of hammering filters through the air, issuing from within the connecting warehouse."
