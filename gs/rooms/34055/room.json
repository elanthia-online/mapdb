      "The great dais at the center of the cavern is a sparkling hexagonal confection of icy blue glaes.  A constellation of golden flecks winks from within the depths of the stone.  Four bridges arc away from the platform in each of the cardinal directions, anchoring it to crescent-shaped galleries arcing along the walls of the great cavern.  Tall steps climb toward a crystalline glaes throne at the center of the expansive platform.  Its shadow stretches over a quintet of newer seats cut from the same crystal."
