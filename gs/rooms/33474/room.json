      "Polished marble floors surround an ornate freestanding bath embellished with elegant gold fixtures.  Curtained windows provide the space with natural light while a large crystal chandelier suspended from a silver chain hangs overhead.  A square silver-framed mirror hangs above a polished beechwood vanity topped with a polished stone sink while several storage bins are tucked away underneath.  In opposite corners of the bath sits a gold filigree bin and a small collection of incense on a small beechwood stand."
