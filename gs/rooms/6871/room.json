      "A long bar made of polished golden oak dominates one wall.  Partially shuttered lanterns provide a comfortingly dim light, and both tables and padded stools along the bar itself give nice places to rest and enjoy a drink.  Pretty waitresses in flirtatious attire weave in and out of the tables, smiling despite their obviously ghostly state."
