      "Barrels, crates, and heavy chains are neatly arranged amid tree stumps at the edge of a forest where a bunch of trees are being harvested for lumber.  Deep furrows in the grass disappear once they meet the hardpacked dirt of the road, which has a sturdy fence on one side that blocks off the edge of a cliff.  A small wooden sign tacked to one of the stumps is wood-burned with a short message."
