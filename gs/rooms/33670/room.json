      "Azure walls, painted with fluffy clouds, meet the dark green floors, which are littered with dust bunnies and bits of straw.  In the center of the room a replica of the famed silver well stands in disrepair, its sides missing several stones and its rope missing its bucket.  A small taxidermy doe lies on its side in the dust, its vacant eyes gazing at the eastern niche."
