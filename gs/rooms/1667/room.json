      "A tall, rocky escarpment rises above you to the north.  The striated rock looks almost as if it had been gouged out by claws.  Yew trees and thanot grow thickly along the path.  Some of the trees lean against each other, the victims of some bygone storm.  One has toppled down the side of the hill."
