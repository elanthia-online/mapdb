      "Long stretches of glowing white sand stretch along this tranquil oceanfront.  Dotted here and there with tall coconut palms, the incredible starry view is mostly unobstructed.  Gentle waves roll onto the shore, each throwing a small spray before ebbing back out into the dark sea.  A large cleared work area has been made in the sand."
