      "A slime-covered pond to the southwest has claimed most of the graves where mossy tombstones lie partially submerged in the inky water.  From the thick forest to the north and east, limbs overgrown with thick lichen reach out to obscure the sky.  The air is thick with moisture and the stench of decay."
