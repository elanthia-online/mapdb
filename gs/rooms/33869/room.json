      "Heartleaf-draped pergolas of aged mahogany dot the perimeter of the paved walkway, the curling tendrils skimming the linen-cushioned chairs shaded beneath the leafy bower.  The echoes of the boardwalk reverberate across a stack of ebony crates, intermingling with the occasional cacophony of seagulls soaring over the port.  A tall faenor-wrought lamp post stands nestled in a crescent of vert foliage, the leaves spilling across the curved planter and brushing against a rivet-bolted bronze plaque."
