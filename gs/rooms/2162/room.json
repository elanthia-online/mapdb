      "Lava pools grow more prevalent, confining the trail to narrow walkways across the smoking vista.  Steam hisses from the gaping, magma-filled wounds in the landscape like a chorus of angry snakes.  As bubbles pop on the surface of the pools, they add a deeper-toned syncopation to the cacophony."
