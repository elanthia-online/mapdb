    "description": [
      "This area is by the shore of an underground lake.  Dim light comes from some of the phosporescent lichen here.  As you look across the lake you notice a slight current seems to flow through it, possibly feeding to the Locksmehr River at some point.  Some discarded fishing tools and a few fish remains lie on the shore.  The shore continues to the east.  To the south you see a smaller tunnel heading off from this massive chamber."
