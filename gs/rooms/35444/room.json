      "Rising out of the center of the floor, a towering model volcano climbs as high as ten giantmen standing atop each others' shoulders.  A circular balcony girds the cone, a torch-lit wreath beneath the domed glass ceiling.  The occasional flicker of torchlight reflects off hundreds of white starstones high overhead."
