      "Sheer blue netting drapes elegantly from the top of the canopy bed and is tied back with a white, braided cord to display the royal blue butterfly-embroidered coverlet.  Soft pools of light emanate from the tinted globes of oil lamps and reflect off the polished surfaces of matching end tables that flank the bed, enhancing the cozy atmosphere of the bedchamber.  Dark blue carpeting patterned with butterflies in gold spreads from wall to wall.  Piles of tasseled pillows are placed near the fireplace."
