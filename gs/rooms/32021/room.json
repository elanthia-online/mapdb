      "A small aviary sits beneath the bower of skeletal trees, the brass cage crushed beneath the weight of a fallen branch, leaving the barred door buried in the dirt.  The faint shrieks of avians echo throughout the area, hidden behind the series of villas enshrouded behind the thick hoarbeam trunks."
