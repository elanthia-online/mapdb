      "Along the eastern wall of the colosseum are a series of windowed booths occupied by well-dressed cashiers.  The glass windows are secured by steel grates, but should the fortifications fail to protect the staff, there are also squads of armed guards standing warily in brigandine armor nearby.  Most of the workers' desks hold piles of coin in an assortment of denominations, promissory notes, and tradebars in varying sizes and metals."
