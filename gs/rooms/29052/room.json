      "Dented, rusting, and malformed, the central section of an enormous cruise ship is beached upon the rocky shoals.  Bamboo torches, bright spheres of light in the thick fog and indigo mist, flank a pair of waterlogged doors surrounded by glassless portholes.  Another series of torches provides dim illumination for a loose scree trail that leads back to the western slope."
