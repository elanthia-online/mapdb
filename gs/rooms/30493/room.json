      "Entering this warmly lit room, a mismatched collection of overstuffed leather armchairs frames the majority of the area, the pieces arranged in small cozy groups.  Amid one grouping, a low silvery haon table supports a tea service.  A tufted silk pillow here and a soft rolton-fleece blanket there add feminine touches to the otherwise masculine room.  Along the far wall, a birds-eye maple sideboard offers a variety of spirits and refreshments.  A burnished brass door leads back to the administrative offices."
