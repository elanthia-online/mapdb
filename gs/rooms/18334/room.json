      "Jutting forth from the muddy banks of the murky river, tall stands of heliconias sway in the current.  Clumps of grass congest the flow of the water, their tapering surfaces glistening as moonlight reflects from the iridescent beads of water clinging to them.  A fairly large collection of water grasses has created a floating meadow on the eastern side of the river, the feathery tops of the plants barely muting the symphony of the nocturnal insects living within.",
