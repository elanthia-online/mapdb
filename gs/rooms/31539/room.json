      "Beautiful alabaster stone is fitted together almost perfectly with barely a seam showing.  Passageways break off leading in other directions.  A glowing portal hovers above the floor, a bright sandy area can be seen on the other side.  Several iron sconces are set into the walls and fitted with golden-hued candles.  A wide variety of weapons hang on either side of the corridor with several shields interspersed between them."
