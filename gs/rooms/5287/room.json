      "The descent into the fog to the southeast is accompanied by a decrease in temperature that seems unnatural for this area.  The fog swirls in delight at the approach of travelers, as if feeding on the heat they bring to the area.  A breeze high above does not touch the fog, but occasionally whines like a wailing child."
