      "Dominating any other form of illumination within the destroyed interior of this house is a floating, large crystal jar full of swirling, scintillating gemstones.  Sparks arc from one gemstone to the next at a continuous, measured pace, a colorful display of light refracting from each surge of electricity across the surfaces of the jar and its contents.  A scorched shallow pit resides below the jar, various bits of lightning glass scattered across the remnants of a wall and upheaved dirt."
