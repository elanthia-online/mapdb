      "Bone-white sands deepen in this rounded alcove, where currents swirl in lazy eddies around a coral formation rising like a gnarled tree from the floor.  Pale branches stretch outward, their surfaces mottled in hues of gold and faded crimson.  Bioluminescent tube anemones cling to the upper limbs, casting a soft glow across the hollow.  A mirror framed in nacre is wedged into the coral wall, while a barnacle-covered a wide shell-shaped sign nearby bears elegant script illuminated by the shifting light."
