      "A roaring bonfire burns, started from a collection of stacked pine boles.  It fills the air with smoke and the bite of hot resin.  Light from the cavorting flames drives back the gloom of the sunless sky, casting the surrounding longhouses in radiance akin to daylight.  Several huge benches made from felled trees ring the flame, heedless of the overwhelming heat belching from the pyre."
