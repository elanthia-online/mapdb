      "Whitewashed panels of wood line the corridor in a circular pattern.  A railing crafted of cast iron chain links encircles an open space that goes down to the main floor.  A pair of brushed copper lanterns hang on either side of a dark green door and a dark blue door that are set into the curved walls."
