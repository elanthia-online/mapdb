      "The crystals sprouting from the far wall of this sprawling cavern give off a light of their own in a shifting rainbow of color.  Drops fall in a quick, steady pace from the top of the cavern and land in a very deep puddle below the wall.  The path leading towards the crystals has been well-worn by many gnollish feet."
