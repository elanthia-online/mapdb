      "Cobwebs adorn the corners of the room between floor and ceiling and wall and floor, and it generally looks to have been untouched in an age.  Every surface appears in need of a good cleaning, including a dust-covered ebonwood cabinet with glass doors that rests against the far wall.  An age-darkened parchment sign on the side of the cabinet clings in place, looking ready to fall at any moment."
