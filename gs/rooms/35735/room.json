      "Swollen with long exposure to the brine, the deck planks seem to crowd in on one another, leaving gaps where their edges have curled up.  Even they have been spared the worst of the sea's wrath when compared to the main deck below, which is trapped beneath the restless tides.  The main mast of the vessel has fallen, but its shrouds still whip in the ocean breeze, riddled here and there with jagged slashes."
