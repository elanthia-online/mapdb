      "A grey stone obelisk lies on its side, the etchings on its face corroded by the ungentle touch of saltwater.  Swirls of prismatic light crawl over the tenebrous surface of the stone.  A sheer cliff face, blood-red and shot through with forking bits of blue stone like veins, hangs over the ruined carving, brooding and silent."
