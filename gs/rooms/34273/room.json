      "Cabinets hang along the southern wall of the classroom, beneath which are counters covered with recycled pickling jars filled with crafting supplies that range from beads and baubles to chalk and pencils.  Steel-topped worktables surrounded by mahogany chairs are scattered about the room beneath the steady glow of suspended hurricane lanterns, while an open space near the eastern wall provides room for several individuals to teach before a blue-grey slate chalkboard."
