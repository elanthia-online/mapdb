      "Dozens of iron-bound birdcages creak loudly upon the rusted poles scattered throughout the garden, the warped doors barely clinging to the latches.  A haphazard labryinth of dark-colored grasses leads up to the beast-carved door, the entry flanked by a duo of moss-draped gargoyles looming from tall pillars.  Set at the far corner of the grounds is a solitary marble statue, the androgynous form standing before discarded piles of dirt-caked feathers and shredded ribbons of embroidered silk."
