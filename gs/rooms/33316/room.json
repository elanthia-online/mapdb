      "The interior of this spacious tent is heavily draped with luxurious red fabrics.  Red silk carpets inlaid with intricate gold patterns cover the floor.  Several full-length mirrors have been artistically placed between the low, chest-covered tables that line the walls.  Shining brass oil lamps hang from tent poles and reflect flickering light over each specular surface.  A large mahogany and gilt jewelry stand holds a place of pride in the direct center of the tent."
