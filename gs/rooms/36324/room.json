      "The bright hue of the plush, padded dark magenta velvet walls is tempered somewhat by a curtain of linked gold disks.  An opulent chandelier casts candlelight over the circular room, bathing a multi-tiered champagne fountain beset by a pair of plush magenta velvet chaises inverted head-to-toe from each other in the center of the room with a warm, pink glow.  A lacquered rosewood mirror leans up against the wall beside a highly varnished wood table, while an array of highly polished gold hooks mark evenly spaced intervals around the circumference of the room."
