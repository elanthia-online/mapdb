      "An expansive oil painting depicting the hotel gardens from a birds-eye view hangs near the entrance to a long hallway.  Furnished with a spindly table, its centerpiece a tapered black glaes vase filled with jewel-toned direblooms, the landing offers a brief respite between floors.  The curve of the staircase draws the eye naturally toward the chandelier-lit ceiling above."
