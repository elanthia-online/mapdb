    "description": [
      "Golden sunlight warms the air, which is heavy and balmy from the rise and fall of the surf that separates the glittering sands of the beach from the roped-off swimming area.  Umbrellas dot the coast, their vibrant silken expanses offering shade to the blankets set beneath them.  Beach grass-riddled dunes create a barrier between the sprawling streets of the shopping district and the beach, while a sandy pathway accommodates the foot traffic.",
      "Cool and misty, the air is dominated by the sound of the surf as it pounds against the sandy beach beneath the silvery light of the moons.  Passing clouds occasionally cast shadows upon the landscape and paint the various umbrellas lining the coast in caliginous hues.  Beach grass-riddled dunes create a barrier between the sprawling streets of the shopping district and the beach, while a sandy pathway accommodates the foot traffic."
