      "Starlight creeps through stained glass windows that dominate the eastern wall, the tenuous light reddened by the colored panes.  It illuminates a raised dais on which are set tables and seats that watch over the hall.  To the north, the high ceilings rise in parallel with a series of steps that climb toward an ostentatious chamber.  No less grand is a jeweled archway to the east.  Opposite the steps is a smaller, less impressive arch framing the entrance to the kitchens.",
