      "Water-roughened oak and fel piers jut out from a large docking structure.  Several rope-wrapped ironwood posts set at regular intervals are covered in barnacles and salt stains, and the constant susurrus of waves hitting the pilings fills the air.  A stack of unused buoys, each stamped with a green wisp, rests next to a large sign reading, \"North 'Haven Quay, White Pier - Slips 21-25.\""
