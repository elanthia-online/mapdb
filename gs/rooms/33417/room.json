    "description": [
      "Cutting its way through the feathery heads of nassella grass, the smooth planks of the boardwalk seem almost pearlescent in the starlight.  Pockmarked with tiny holes, the southern cliff face is covered in sea oxeye daisy vines and hosts the nests of dozens of tropical birds.  A large wooden bench rests on one side of the boardwalk, while opposite a narrow game trail snakes between the huddled forms of domiciles that are nestled within the sheltering grass and dunes."
