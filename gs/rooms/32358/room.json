      "Grey and black planks fray into splintered ends as they stretch toward the frigid waters, resembling grasping skeletal talons.  Old nails barely hold the pier together, but have bled dark red rust onto the surrounding wood.  Gleaming ice crystals cling to the wood, their loveliness making the docks' disrepair all the more ugly.",
      "The wood of the westernmost pier has silvered unevenly, leaving a strange stripe pattern in the warped planks as they alternate between grey and black.  The nails securing the planks are spotted with rust that makes each look as if it sits in a pool of old dried blood.  Traceries of rime glisten from the wood, lending a glint of natural beauty to the manmade decay."
