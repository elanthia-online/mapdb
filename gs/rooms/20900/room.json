      "The onset of the jungle wilderness is sudden, making the nearby existence of civilization seem a fantastical concept.  Green dominates the entirety of the rainforest setting, with a thick leaf canopy formed by the verdant growth of tall trees filtering any light into that color as well.  The drone of insects provides a subtle natural music, low and buzzing.  In the distance a haze of fog nearly obscures the view of the coast.",
