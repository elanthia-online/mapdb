    "description": [
      "At the base of an escarpment, a colossal carving of a harpy dominates the rock face, wings stretched wide in jagged relief.  Weathered grooves mark each feather and define sharp stone talons.  Crude swaths of ochre, soot, and rancid fat streak the figure's hollow eyes, lending them a gleam whenever firelight flares from sputtering flames roaring from stone braziers.  Wind blows through chiseled crevices in mournful chords that shiver across the crags."
