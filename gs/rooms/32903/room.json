      "Stretching towards the city of Brisker's Cove, a long dock with fingerlike extensions shows signs of recent refurbishing.  Braided hemp rope is wound through holes within multiple pilings along the western edge, while the east holds the entrance to Pier 5.  Planted at the edge of the dock, a several stories high flagpole thrusts its snapping pennants skyward."
