      "A gold chandelier provides the end of the hallway with abundant light from a cleverly recessed section of the ceiling.  It reveals a large circular room, and astonishingly, the walls have been painted in great detail with modern-day Wehnimer's Landing.  The illusion is effective, making it seem as if the room is placed strategically in the air above Wehnimer's Landing, offering a panoramic view of the entire city.  A large granite statue dominates the center of the room, gazing south."
