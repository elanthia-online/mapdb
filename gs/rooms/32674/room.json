      "Various bins, counters, and shelves overflowing with grocery staples line the white oak walls and pale blue tiled floors of the bright and airy market.  A sizable ceramic-topped cupboard is centered along the back, its shelves bursting with fresh baked goods.  Large glaesineth orbs hanging from the raftered ceiling fill the spacious room with warm light."
