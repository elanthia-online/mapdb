      "Ribbons ripple gently against marble pillars, their movement faint beneath the lanterns' glow.  Stained glass panels cast mosaics of color over the tile floor, blending into the deepening shadows.  Towers of suede-covered books stand beneath the arches, their rich colors subdued in the dim light.  A fabric-draped stall rests nearby, journals arranged in careful stacks, their covers gleaming where the lanterns' flicker catches the embossed details.  The faint scent of parchment lingers in the cool air."
