      "The mahogany planks comprising the shop walls are covered in copper-framed drawings of dense tree-covered woodland areas, the depictions varying through mediums of charcoal and paint.  Between the artwork are vertical diagrams of flatware and crockery, each piece carefully detailed in flowing calligraphy, the illustrations set alongside their matching counterparts across a glass-filled display.  A bare countertop of wood-framed stone sits at the back of the shop, unadorned save for an aged brass lamp."
