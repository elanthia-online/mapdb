      "The pathways loop around a long, narrow pool of slick, slime-covered water.  The fog, thick elsewhere, lays lightly on the surface of the pool.  The lower branches of a sickly willow tree, nearly devoid of leaves, dip into the foul-smelling water.  A thin gurgle of water can be heard to the northeast."
