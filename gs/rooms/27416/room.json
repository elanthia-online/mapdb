      "Cold and dark, this small, windowless room serves as an entryway leading to a larger workspace.  Tanned hides and scraps of black leather are scattered across the dirt-covered flooring, while a wooden rack and a rickety table provide a rudimentary display for this shop's wares.  A heavy acidity lingers in the air, presumably from an overuse of tanning dyes and curing liquids."
