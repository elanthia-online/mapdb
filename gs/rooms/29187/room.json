      "Crafted from white oak, the shiplapped walls of the shop contrast with darker wood trim that accents the room.  Shelves filled with packets and canisters of tobacco and coffee line the walls above a glass-inset oak counter.  Mugs and silverware are haphazardly stacked in a crate resting on the floor.  The scent of tobacco permeates the air, punctuated by the strong aroma of roasted coffee."
