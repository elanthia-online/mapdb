      "The eastern wall of the room is made of leaded panes of thick, ruby-colored glass.  A slight draft from the fireplaces set on either side of the room stirs the crystal drops from the chandeliers, filling the air with a gentle musical chiming.  A dais is set against the ruby-glass wall, which provides an elegant backdrop to the entertainers who perform here."
