      "Beneath the shadow of a wrecked hulk with a huge gash along the side of its hold, a small scrap of jagged stone rises defiantly from the waters of the sea.  The jagged rock faces are slick with seafoam where they are not crusted in hardy barnacles with bright silver shells.  Fissures in the stony islet run deep, sheltering colorful, squawking seabirds that flit nervously from nest to sky.  Their streaky droppings are starkly white against the black basalt."
