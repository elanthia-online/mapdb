      "Perched upon a tall stack of books, a pale wizened wizard peeks out from behind an elevated desk littered with unfurled scrolls, spilled ink pots, and broken quills.  Floating globes suffused with eldritch blue light throw sinister shadows across the stone floor and onto a glass display case.  In front of the desk, velvet-roped stanchions form a chaotic maze for those waiting in line."
