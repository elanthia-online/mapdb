      "Tiles on the walls, ceiling, and floor of this circular room form incredibly intricate geometric patterns which center on the large statue of a blood eagle in the middle of the room.  A wide arch flanked by a pair of brass braziers leads out onto a balcony.  Against the far wall, an oak-framed mirror reflects the fire from the braziers."
