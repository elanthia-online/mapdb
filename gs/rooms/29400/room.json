      "A thick, crimson rug stretches across the rough-hewn plank floor.  Bolted into the back wall is a polished brass rod, its contents held safely off the ground.  A trio of tall gold-framed mirrors occupy one corner, positioned at precise angles to allow for optimal preening.  A pair of eahnor-caged lanterns frame a polished oak door carved with dragonstalks, and a lacquered oak rack serves as the centerpiece for the room."
