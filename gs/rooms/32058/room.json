      "Dappled with glistening beads of dew, feathery painted ferns thrive beside the streambanks.  A luminous cloak of greenery droops from the trees on either side, casting a blue-green glow over the fringe-winged white egret orchids interspersed amongst the fronds.  Lichen-encrusted roots burst from the damp trail as it follows the gentle curve of the brook."
