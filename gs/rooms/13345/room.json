      "Plush grass follows the decline of a gentle slope, dotted here and there with small weathered boulders.  A lovely white bower, nearly covered by a climbing rose, drips deep red blossoms from above in billowy clouds.  The edges of the clearing are planted with profusely blooming blaeston bushes, fragrant lavender, and pale blue phlox.",
