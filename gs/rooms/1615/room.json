      "Two wind-swept rock towers rise from the ground to the east.  The trail skirts their bases in one direction, and in the other strikes out along a narrow ridge to the northwest.  From your perch upon this plateau you are able to look out across the foothills to the south, so green in comparison to this stony desolation."
