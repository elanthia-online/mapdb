      "A wide wooden counter spans the entire width of this room, and interspersed across its top are heavy iron bars a handsbreadth apart, securely fastened to both the counter and the stone ceiling overhead.  A glossy black placard inlaid with gold leaf text is prominently placed above a single gap in the center of the iron supports.  Three stern-looking guards stand at the ready, their hands near their weapons as they track every movement in the room."
