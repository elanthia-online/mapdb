      "Many-petaled falls of purple wisteria overtake the gnarled, leafless trees looming over the small, lambent pool feeding the creek.  Trickling from hollows in the trunks, rivulets cascade over moss and roots to the water's surface.  The floral-enswathed scene is set aglow by globular, celestial blue crystals caught in coiled branches, deepening the shadows of the forest beyond the veil."
