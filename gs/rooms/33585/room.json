      "Rising up over the top of a hill, this vantage point creates a slight clearing, affording a peek over the treetops.  To the northeast, a shadowy stone tower sits off in the distance, its crenellated design evident.  Wagon ruts are dug deep into the trail, commemorating the many travelers who have, at one time or another, stopped here to rest and catch the view."
