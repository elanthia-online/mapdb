      "Large clumps of marram grass sprout from the dunes on either side of a cultivated path as they slope toward the water.  Sea foam eddies and swirls among the rocks littering the beach, lapping at the edges of an overturned dinghy.  A rope-railed fishing pier extends from the sand out over the moonlit water, ending in a stack of crab traps leaning against a fishing shack."
