      "This large cavern has been arranged as a multi-purpose room, providing shelter in times of need and a gathering or practice space for citizens and militia alike.  Flanked by an archway and a door, the entrance passageway stands opposite a large hearth, constructed of local materials and shadowed by a large tapestry featuring the Mist Harbor crest above it.  The modular nature of the room features some padded benches for meetings that can be pushed aside in times of need."
