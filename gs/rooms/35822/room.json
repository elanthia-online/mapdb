      "The interior of this section of the hovel is spare, with all surfaces painted a bright violet.  There were once windows, but they have been boarded over with violet-painted driftwood that is further colored by the silhouette of a vivid indigo marionette.  A wide-mouthed stone ossuary, also painted violet, sits in the room's center.  A threadbare velvet curtain sections off a small nook at the area's back."
