      "A white oak arch with swinging doors separates the kitchen and pub, sealing off some of the noise from the bustling staff at work.  A large fel cupboard occupies one corner, its doors ajar, revealing shelves stacked with sumptuous dishes and prepared desserts.  A white marble counter is laden with cutting boards and a variety of knives and utensils, while several pots and pans continuously bubble and bake across the numerous stoves built along the walls."
