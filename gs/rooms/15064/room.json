      "Plain wooden walls rise from a mistwood plank floor.  Just above a fishcale blue mermaid figurine hangs a fused sun and moon wall-hanging, and a mistwood beam ceiling completes the picture.  A set of carved felwood shelves and a plain wooden table stand side by side in the middle of the room."
