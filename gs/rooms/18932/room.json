      "This center of knowledge also seems to serve as the center of traffic for the Guild.  Smooth, cool limestone flooring leads off to the north, northwest, northeast and west, while a ramp leads steeply upward to the south.  This windowless room holds thousands of manuscripts on magic, history, geography, and a myriad of other subjects.  Easy chairs scattered about provide places to rest and read, each accompanied by a standing brass lamp."
