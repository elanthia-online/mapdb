      "Three immense masks of red-veined starveil loom over a raised dais of basalt at the hall's end, jeweled eyes staring intently down at an altar of scrimshawed whalebone.  Bars of gold and pieces of exotic jewelry are heaped at the altar's base, but the flat of it is occupied by a single ancient volume with pages edged in gold leaf.  Torches burn fitfully throughout the shrine, casting dancing shadows that take strange forms along the walls."
