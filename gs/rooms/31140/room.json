      "This room is decorated in silver and black.  It is neat and tidy with nothing out of place and no dust to be seen anywhere.  There is a bed along one wall with an ebony wardrobe next to it.  A desk and a glass-fronted bookcase stand under a window across the room and a small, well-stocked bar completes the decor."
