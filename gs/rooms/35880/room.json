      "Symbols of the Arkati are carved into the walls of this tidy shop.  Dwarves hurry between spools of metallic wire and a tool-covered workbench, and short lengths of bent metal wire are organized in rows across its surface.  Completed talismans are displayed on small hooks, dangling from a long wooden rod."
