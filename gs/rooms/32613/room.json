      "[The Blue Orchid]"

    "description": [
      "Glass-paned lanterns hang from wooden beams along the ceiling casting a glow throughout the area.  The walls are decorated with several framed paintings of blue orchids, and a low counter is cluttered with an abundance of ink bottles and an assortment of needles.  Silk onyx curtains border a wide window, the display showcasing multi-hued stock tattoo drawings.  In the back, a muscular tattoo artist leans over a writing desk, an inked-hand diligently sketching a design on a piece of vellum."
