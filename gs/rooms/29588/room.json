      "Numerous round tables with place settings for a dozen crowd the chamber, the chairs around them tucked neatly under their tablecloths.  A rustic-looking sideboard with extra linens and flatware stands out of the way of the entrances to the dining room.  Atop each table sits a small potted plant.  The western bridge stands to one side, while behind it another bridge stretches to the south."
