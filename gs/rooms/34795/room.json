      "The lighting here is dim, but not enough to obscure the opalescent wallpaper.  Couches and upholstered chairs in every shade of the rainbow are scattered around the room in groups, surrounding tables set with food.  A long mahogany bar occupies one wall, which is hung with a mirror that only magnifies the maelstrom of color in the room.  One has to wonder if the decor is an attempt at opulence, or if it is intended to induce patrons to drink more, just to blunt their senses."
