      "The corner of this foyer allotted for the assistant is incredibly cramped, filled with bookshelves, map cases and loosely rolled scrolls, all arranged in no discernable order.  A shoddy desk, mounded with loose papers, encroaches on what little floor space is available.  Vividly woven in crimson, pure white and touches of cerulean blue, a luxurious figured silk rug adorns the polished floor boards."
