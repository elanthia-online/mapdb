      "Ancient hexagonal braziers of bronze stand to either side of the immense double doors to the antechamber, their roaring flames casting back the cavern's gloom.  The hewn stone ceiling is inlaid with bands of golvern that are gold against the black of the rock.  Pennants stitched with rampant mules, leaping flames, shards of ice, and other devices fly from polished bronze mounts beneath galleries that overlook the entryway, accompanied by garlands of iceblossom and holly with bright-colored blooms."
