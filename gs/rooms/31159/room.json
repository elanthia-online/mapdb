      "Steam rises out of ancient lava columns, creating a heavy mist that blankets the ground and fills the air with warm heat.  Pointed tips from wild grasses and ivory sedge peek through the cotton-like blanket of moisture that eddies and swirls with the slightest of nearby movement.  Firewood, bright yellow arnica, and oxeye daisies grow in proliferation along the eastern edge of the glade."
