    "description": [
      "Partially hidden by tall, bright green grasses, a pebble-lined brook meanders through the area and disappears under a wall of thorny brambles.  Edelweiss courts juniper saplings near the eastern edge of the meadow, while the opposite verge is shrouded in the shadows of tower conifers.  A delicate fairy ring of scotch bonnet mushrooms encircles a patch of necrotic earth that is illuminated by silvered moonlight."
