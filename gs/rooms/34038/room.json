      "Away from the light of the sun or moons, hints of luminescence thrive within the blackness of the cavern.  Lichen cascades down the smooth-worn stone walls in a dimly glowing tapestry, and the same green-white glow suffuses the few insects that squirm and writhe in the darkness.  Puddles of snowmelt make for a treacherous path through the cumbrous lightlessness."
