      "Light filters through anemone-veiled crevices, casting shifting patterns upon smooth ink-stained stone benches curved along the chamber's walls.  Cork-sealed sea glass jars, each filled with carefully layered pigments, rest alongside inking tools displayed upon a stand of braided kelp cords.  A glass-spined coralline fissure, chiseled into a side wall, offers egress to the main shop."
