      "The interior of this cabin is exceptional in its tidiness and organization, with naught a speck of dirt or dust anywhere to be seen.  Shelves arranged just so boast displays of fine goldsmithing along the walls, and decorative cut-glass jars of jewels sit amongst them.  On a centrally located marble-topped counter island is an oblong cobalt-patterned white pottery bowl, a knotwork-etched gold salver, and a lattice-carved beech tray.  A gold-framed vellum sign rises on a tall stand behind the island."
