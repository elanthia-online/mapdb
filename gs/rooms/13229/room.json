      "An expansive rotunda opens to form a bright, airy room, illuminated by long, narrow windows.  Tall pillars of gold-flecked white marble stretch upward toward the domed ceiling that hovers above the benches facing a carved alabaster altar and a rose quartz baptismal font.  A delightful fresco serves as a colorful backdrop in the nave.  A modwir door leads to a prayer garden and, towards the back of the rotunda, a gold-trimmed haon door leads to the oratory.  A simple maoral door leads to the priest's vestry."
