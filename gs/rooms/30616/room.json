      "Utilitarian at best, the small kitchen has neatly stacked speckled blue plates, cups, and bowls stored on its shelves.  Casks of fresh water have screens on them that prevent bugs from getting into the drinking supply, while thin sheets of cheese cloth protect the produce stored in baskets throughout the space.  Standing alone in one corner, a cast iron stove has an exhaust pipe that disappears into the stone ceiling."
