      "A carved, wooden...thing...has been nailed to the center of this otherwise unadorned square table.  The thing seems to have arms, but one could be a tail, or maybe an ear.  The carving is so poorly done that the subject is not identifiable.  Wooden chairs sized for all races surround the table."
