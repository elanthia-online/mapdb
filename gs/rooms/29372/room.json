      "Golden oak walls enclose this space, brightening the decor, which is primarily composed of varying shades of dark green found in everything from the rugs underfoot to the curtains framing the windows.  The walkway is edged on both sides with floor-to-ceiling shelving that is, in turn, lined with lidded glass jars and dishes of all sizes and shapes.  Above the arch leading deeper into the shop is a gold-lettered banner that reads, \"Welcome to Moomph's Picklearium!\""
