      "Heavily curtained glaesineth doors lead out to a rimed veranda, and swathes of silver-shot ebon velvet are draped across the walls and ceiling.  Myriad moths of arathiel and aragless hang from moonlight-hued ribbons of lotus silk, framing a series of copper cloak pegs.  Dangling from a veniom wire, a moth-embossed parchment floats above a star-carved amethyst case."
