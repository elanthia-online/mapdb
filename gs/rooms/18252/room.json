      "Splintering through shuttered windows, silver slivers of moonlight blend with wavering candlelight to illuminate a long teak counter standing before a montage of chairs and sofas.  Heady incense permeates the air, easily overwhelming the less obtrusive scent of ink.  Even in the low light and plethora of shadows, the contrast between the menagerie of tile spreading out underfoot and the white-washed walls is readily apparent."
