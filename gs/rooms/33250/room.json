    "description": [
      "A rough hole ten feet square and fifteen feet deep has been excavated from the granite rock.  Cold, clammy moisture clings to the walls, and the stench of blood, decaying flesh and excrement hangs heavily in the air.  The ceiling is a heavy steel grate with only a couple of inches between the bars.  Rats peer down from between the bars, eyeing the occupants of the hole hungrily and hoping for the occupants' imminent demise.  What they don't eat, the cockroaches will finish off."
