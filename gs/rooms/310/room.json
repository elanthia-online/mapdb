      "Dockworkers, sailors, fishermen and tradesmen stream by, coming and going even at this hour of night between the docks and the inns and taverns of the Landing.  A group of rough-looking sailors weave drunkenly through the street, chortling over some bawdy joke.",
      "Dockworkers, sailors, fishermen and tradesmen stream by, coming and going in the course of tending the ships that ferry goods and people between the Landing and the far-flung reaches of Elanthia.  A group of rough-looking sailors lead a captive Ice Krolvin sea captain and his crew through the street, glaring disdainfully at anyone in their path."
