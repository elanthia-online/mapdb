      "Polished white birch flooring spreads northward from a glass-paned white birch door, its smooth face preserved beneath a clear varnish.  Tall and colorful, a linen mannequin stands opposite a wide porcelain urn that is filled with sand and painted with geometric patterns.  To the left and right of the entry, raised bamboo racks housing sandals, slippers, and shoes rest beneath hooks designed to house outer garments and similar small items.",
