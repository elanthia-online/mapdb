      "Commanding the best view from the ship, the bow is filled with the sonorous voices of the crew joined in sea shanty while they polish the railing, check the rigging for wear, and swab the wide-plank decking.  A breeze blows in, rustling the sails overhead, the rippling fabric lending another voice to the crew's song."
