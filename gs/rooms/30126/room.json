      "Countless hammocks, fashioned from lengths of sailcloth, are strung from the ceiling in this cramped space.  Makeshift tables have been pieced together from old barrels and warped planks, each set with mismatched tin cups and water pitchers.  A basket of fruit hangs from a post near the door, along with a community toothbrush."
