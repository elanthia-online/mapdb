      "The dank rock walls are close, but it's not as claustrophobic here as in other parts of these caverns.  The garbage, however, seems to be uniformly deep.  A curious 'whisper' of sound can be heard coming from the southeast direction.  To the southwest, a visible trail has been forged through the muck on the tunnel floor."
