      "A particularly ornate luminary dangles from the underside of an oak's bough, its glass-paneled facets cast in a variety of jewel tones and framed in black iron.  Around it, strings of smaller paper lanterns are strung, themselves painted with the rich colors shed by the radiant centerpiece."
