      "The cavern widens into a large room, illuminated by moonlight that streams in through cracks in the ceiling far above.  Colorful mosses, nourished by the sparse sunlight that filters in during the day, grow on ancient stalagmites formed by centuries of dripping water.  To the north, an opening in the wall leads into a darker tunnel.",
