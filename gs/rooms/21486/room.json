      "The interior of this little shack is brightly lit and smells faintly of wet dog.  A small caramel-colored dog, surrounded by her little brood of sleeping pups, watches warily from a thick pallet of blankets off in one corner.  Along the back wall are a series of shelves and a row of rough-cut oak pegs."
