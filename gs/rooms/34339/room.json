      "The view from the massive bridge connecting the waterfall's east bank to the west is unlike any other.  In one direction, the shadowy gaze of a soaring, imperious mountain denies light to the ridges, plateaus, and foothills below.  In the other, it hides a crater filled with the rain of countless storms and a ring of sky-grazing black columns on an island floating in a lake that reflects the always cloudy sky."
