      "Imposing longhouses of unfinished timber tower over the roadside, thatched with dry yellow polar grasses.  The homes are far too large for most humanoids, easily thrice the height of a tall giantman.  There seems little reason or order to their spacing, and the crushed stone road that travels between them meanders and bends accordingly."
