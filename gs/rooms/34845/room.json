      "A branch-pierced dome of murky glass shadows the fur and dust-covered floor of the spacious foyer, the ceiling's design obscured by caked leaves, the contorted wires framing the split staircase leading up into the mansion.  Broken ivory busts are set on rotting mahogany pedestals, the artwork displayed along the walls that open to the hallway, the elongated passageway bisecting the stairs above.  Set into the marble are scraps of twisted metal, the pieces extending out towards the various pathways."
