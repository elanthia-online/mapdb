      "A grid of brass plates, each bearing a single dwarven rune, fills the granite walls and continue down dark corridors to the north and east.  Standing in the southwestern corner is the statue of a dwarven sculptor midway through a project.  Pots sprouting bioluminescent toadstools light the chamber from below with a cool, light blue glow."
