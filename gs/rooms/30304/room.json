      "The large open air pavilion is crisscrossed by copper and silver roping, ahmdir blue and scarlet red tassels blended together to outline the form of a selshis in midair.  Atop a scrollworked rattan dais, the fossilized skeleton of a morduska stands guard over the area.  To each side, small tents have been erected to house the leaders of the respective families."
