      "Transitioning from cobbled stones to rough-slatted wooden boardwalks, the road becomes a wide bridgelike structure that traverses the boggy ground in this section of the town.   Perched at the junction of stone and wood, a glittering golden stone-strewn footpath darts between thick bushes and staghorn sumacs.  Hovels and huts rise above the muddy road on stilts, their entrances accessible via twisting ramps."
