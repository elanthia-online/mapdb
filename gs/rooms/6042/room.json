      "A juncture of three roads occurs amidst four different crop fields.  Culverts and ridges keep the fields from being accessible from this point.",
      "A juncture of three roads occurs amidst four different crop fields.  Wheat grows directly to the north.  The even heights of the plants give the area the appearance of a long, flat sea of light and dark grey grain.  To the west a wide spiral of barley grows toward the heavens, while to the southwest long rows of corn, not yet tasseled, wave in the distance.  A turnip patch displays ribbons of turnip plants to the southeast.  Culverts and ridges keep the fields from being accessible from this point.",
