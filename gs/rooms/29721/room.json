      "Dormant lacquered paper lanterns cling to a downy birch tree that grows just beyond the shadows of the granite ridges, its leafy limbs stretching towards the bright blue sky.  Twisted knots lend the boughs that extend from the trunk the look of gnarled knuckles, while exposed roots resemble thick coils of rope that have been exposed to the elements for too long.  Colorful yarn, ribbons, and hemp mingle amid the verdant leaves, their ends strung with tiny baubles and beads that glimmer in the sunlight.",
      "Cheery lacquered paper lanterns illuminate a downy birch tree that grows alone beyond the craggy granite ridges, its leafy limbs stretching towards the star-spangled sky.  Twisted knots in the thick boughs are dark spots above the nearly luminous white bark, while exposed roots stand out starkly in the snow-dappled grasses.  Colorful yarn, ribbons, and hemp mingle amid the verdant leaves, their ends strung with tiny baubles and beads that glimmer in the moonlight."
