      "Feathery ferns and moss-covered roots fill this part of the forest.  Other than a path and the empty torch holders set at the trunk's base, there is no sign that anyone else has ever set foot here.  The path stretches off into the woods, curving to follow the tree's base.",
      "Bright torches push back the night from their holders at the base of the oak's trunk.  The flickering light illuminates nothing more than the impressive sight of the behemoth tree towering into the darkness and a hard-packed path leading around the tree."
