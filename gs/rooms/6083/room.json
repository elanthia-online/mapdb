      "The stone wall that defines the farmlands' northern border stops at a twisted, tight thicket to the west.  Long, sharp thorns protrude dangerously from the woody plants that cover the slightly marshy ground.  The cheeping of small birds, the croaking of frogs, and the chirping of crickets pour happily out of the dark depths of the thicket.  There appears to be no way into the mass of pointed needles, but there also appears to be no reason for anyone to want to go in there, either."
