      "Occupants of the hall move in and out, tasting the many delicacies offered on a trio of massive, short-legged tables that extend the full width of this cavernous hexagonal room.  Four archways provide entrance to the meeting chambers, from whence the perpetual sounds of debate and discussion can be heard.  Drinks are served at a bar to the east and a small shop resides through a low passage under the main stairway.  To the west, an alcove has been cut into the rough, grey stone wall."
