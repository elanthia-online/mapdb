      "Darkness cloaks this chamber, lit only by the almost nonexistent glow of the tiny brazier in the corner.  No sound intrudes from the outside, filling the room with a silence so thick as to be nearly tangible.  Several small black pillows sit in the floor, dented in the center by the knees of those who have come to remember."
