      "Echoing the vibrant coloration patterning the cliffside it dislodged from, an enormous chunk of granite blocks the winding trail, mottled with elegant sunburst lichen.  A freshly trampled path detours around the boulder, blanketed by bristly grass laid flat over earth pocked with cloven hoofprints.  Incongruous to the frost-dusted landscape, camels graze nearby on the silver posie flourishing around an assortment of wagons covered with selshis skin tarps.",
