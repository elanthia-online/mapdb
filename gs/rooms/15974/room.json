      "A massive pine stands in a clearing ringed by a thick carpet of needles which defies encroachment by snow.  Smaller cousins ring the old one, like the members of a court attending their sovereign.  The lowest branches of the behemoth tower over the roofs of a few cottages snuggled around its feet.  The buildings look like toys in comparison to the stature of the ancient pine."
