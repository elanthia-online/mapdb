      "Sunlight glistens upon the water that drips off the giant propelling mechanism.  A small housing encircles the paddlewheel -- the area filled with the timber that the riverboat uses for fuel.  Adorned on each paddle are golden sheets of metal in the shape of feathers.  Iron rings are bolted to the water-damaged decking, with one particular ring that is slightly misshapen."
