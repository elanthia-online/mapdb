      "Prickly, spiked amber grasses give way to soft tufts of green shoots, low-growing shrubs, and fanciful ferns along the path as the trees above stretch out their branches and interlace.  The ground is dappled with a sort of half-light, little making its way through the tree limbs of the auroral shifts of color in the sky and more originating with the motes of foxfire-hued illumination dancing between."
