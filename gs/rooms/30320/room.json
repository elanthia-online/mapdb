      "Carved benches depicting wild beasts ring a dwindling fire at the center of a clearing near the bend of the river, the creatures subtly hidden beneath thin layers of frost.  A small awning to the southwest provides shelter for a communal kitchen and wooden larder that is filled with a variety of provisions and supplies.  Stacked firewood sits in a wrought iron cradle-like structure nearby, tented beneath a sheet of weathered oilcloth held down by steel hooks."
