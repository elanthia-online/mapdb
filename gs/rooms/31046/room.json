      "Delectable scents fill the air as cozy heat tumbles through the space.  Bright lights illuminate the various dishes that are stored on tables, meat platters, and a seafood counter, while various clay soup pots warm on the many stoves at the back of the eatery.  Rhimar-lined cases house a cheese plate and a fruit bowl on one side of the entry, while drakar-lined cases keep several bread baskets and a large vegetable terrine warm."
