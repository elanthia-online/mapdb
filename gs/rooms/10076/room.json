      "Scantily dressed mannequins line the far wall of this small shop.  A glass counter lies somewhere under a huge pile of bolts of fabric in a vast array of colors and materials.  In one corner of the room, open boxes lay on their side, most of the contents pulled out haphazardly and strewn over the plush sea-blue carpet.  Several sachets overstuffed with rosemary are strategically placed about the room, their fragrant aroma filling the area."
