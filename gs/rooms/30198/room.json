      "Comprised of saltstained boards of oak and fel, this large docking structure has five long piers extending from it and is dotted with oddly colored barnacles.  Several docking slips provide ample portage, each with a thick cork bumper padding the rough edges.  Ironwood support posts are set at regular intervals, and a carved oak sign inlaid with bits of ruby nassa reads, \"North 'Haven Quay, Crimson Pier - Slips 11-15.\""
