      "The bloated corpse of some kind of ox bobs in the creek waters below you.  A pair of muddy birds scavenge supper from this bounty, sharing the meal with countless insects.  Countless small, cloven footprints in the mud by the creek's edge evidence that this is the urghs' favored watering hole."
