      "Jagged metal sheets form a broken pathway across the area, forming the vague shape of a sword buried beneath the rubble of the desolate buildings on the horizon.  A quartet of gear-jointed figurines erratically move along the four corners of the neighborhood, each one garbed in the frayed remains of wool robes.  Sharply pointed ears protrude from one figurine, another covered entirely in scales across its exposed body, while the remaining duo stand facing each other, scimitar and dagger in hand."
