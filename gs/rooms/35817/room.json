      "Ceiling-skimming floral displays threaten to consume the brocaded walls of the room, the rug-covered floor beneath it sprinkled in a kaleidoscope of petals and leaves leading up to a series of colorful marble vases set on fluted podiums.  Wire-strung origami birds soar across the sky blue silk-paneled chandelier, their lacquered wings dusted in large flakes of glitter."
