      "Many woven reed pillows and several benches are haphazardly set across this open section of boardwalk.  The multiple pieces of linen that form the canopy above are pinned against their supporting pillars, revealing a bright sky.  At one end of this area, a driftwood bar has been set up.  Next to it, some sandy wooden stairs lead under the boardwalk but are blocked by a muscled half-elf.  At the other end, several linen hammocks are suspended between the pillars."
