      "Rosy surfaces gleam in the glow of a soft light.  Sunken in the floor is a luxuriously large marble tub, steam rising from the water's surface.  Sculpted in gold, a naiad rests in the corner, water from her jug ready to warm your bath.  A single wash basin will serve your needs should you have no time to tarry.  Large and small, soft clean towels are neatly stacked in a corner shelf."
