      "A dazzling array of crystal beads decorate the inside of this tent, arranged horizontally and spaced evenly from the bottom edge to the apex of the arched ceiling.  Each row of crystals shifts to a different hue of the rainbow, refracting the small amount of starlight making its way through the tent's entryway.  Pelts and hides form the walls of the tent, supported by slender lengths of faewood."
