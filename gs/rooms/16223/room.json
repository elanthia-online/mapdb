      "The court is ringed by buildings painted in a rich palette of color.  Shutters on some are painted contrasting hues which are as vivid, yet blend harmoniously with the whole.  Large terra-cotta urns hold a riot of blossoms beside many of the doors, providing yet more pattern to the visual feast."
