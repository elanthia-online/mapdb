    "description": [
      "Charred rocks arranged in a circle form a makeshift firepit in the cool sand beneath the busy pier.  Clawprints are clearly visible in the moist brown sand, documenting the ravaging of a pile of discarded food by various crabs, reptiles, and rodents.  Sounds filter down from above, the squeak and screech of ships rubbing against the deep water end of the pier rising and falling in rhythm with the waves."
