      "The cobblestone street winds up into the hills, continuing on through a wooden gate set into a tidy stone wall.  Two lanterns sit on either side of the gate while magnolia trees grow behind the wall, obscuring what lies beyond it.  Many of the homes here are clustered closely together near the wall, their windows bright with light."
