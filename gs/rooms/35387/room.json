      "Faint embers glow in the firepit below, their warmth carrying the rich scent of slow-roasted meat through the eastern passage.  Shadows stretch along the tiled floor as torchlight flickers beneath the arches, casting shifting patterns across the stone.  A bread vendor lingers beneath a farm stand awning, arranging fresh loaves in quiet order.  To the west, the colonnade opens into a courtyard, its fountain reflecting the warm hues of nearby flames as water ripples in steady motion."
