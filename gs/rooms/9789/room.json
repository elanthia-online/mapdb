      "The network of twisted roots opens into a sizeable cavern, the walls held up by six substantially oversized roots.  A blanket of mist suspended just above the ground swirls and convulses at the slightest provocation.  Close to the center of the cavern, one of the oversized roots was cut down and fashioned into a round dais."
