      "Strange obelisks grow from the spongiform stone as it arcs into an undulating bridge, their edges straight near the base but turning sinuous and warped near the rounded head of each.  Their surfaces crawl with meaningless symbols too random in configuration to be written language.  The characters shift to follow the curves of the stonework.  Below, supports of the same material are positioned along the bridge's length, clad in the same nonsensical etchings."
