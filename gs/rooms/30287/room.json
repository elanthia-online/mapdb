      "Tucked away from the bustle of the airship terminus, this small room is only slightly less crowded than the main lobby.  A steady flow of people come and go through a broad archway to pick up or drop off parcels with the mail clerk behind a heavily dented oak counter.  The stuffy air is filled with a light dust that smells of paper, burlap, and sweat."
