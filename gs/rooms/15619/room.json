      "Small and square, the stone walls of this chamber are oriented so that each corner is at a cardinal direction.  Four pillars occupy the ground midway between the center of the room and each corner, each balancing on the merest point, standing on a base formed of an inverted, four-sided pyramid.  A dim, green-tinged white glow emanates from the semi-translucent base of each pillar, as if the pyramids were formed of some kind of luminescent crystal."
