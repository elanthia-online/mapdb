    "description": [
      "A sheer cliff effectively terminates the trail to the south, with the top branches of an oak below protruding above the drop off.  Twisted bits of rusted metal lie discarded at the edge, a support frame for a lift system, if the decaying strands of rope and chunks of pulleys are any indication.  Far off, a dark ribbon of water cuts across the landscape, where the fortress of Ta'Vaalor can be seen.  The trail leads northerly, away from the cliff's edge and toward a rocky rise far in the distance."
