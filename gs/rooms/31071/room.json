      "Standing to the side of a small wooden cabin is a large corral of mules, their braying echoing across the mountainside.  Drifts of snow brush up against a crude log building tucked against the rocky hillside.  A chill wind blows about the plateau, swirling snowflakes throughout the air with icicles hanging from most surfaces."
