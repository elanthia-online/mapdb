      "Crystal globes hang from above, their filmy coverings shedding a pale light over the shop.  Bits of fishing net hang from rough-hewn rafters, their weaves holding a variety of items for sale.  Tucked to one side of the entrance is a worn copper-banded barrel overflowing with a wide array of wares.  A driftwood sign hangs above several chests lined up against the far wall."
