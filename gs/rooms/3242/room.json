      "Two ranges of hills embrace a valley swathed in deep drifts of snow.  Travel further along the path without getting lost beneath the snow might be possible, with some luck.  The wind is not as noticeable in this area, as the abounding hills provide some protection from its cruelty.  A descending ridge heading westward is mostly clear of snowfall.",
