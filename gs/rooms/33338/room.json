      "The stretch of diamond-white beach shines like a second sun.  Liquid light glistens off of several tidepools clinging to the cliffside, refracting onto the rocks in curtains of rainbowed color.  The scents of the sea and the isle's overgrown greenery commingle into a salty-sweet melange in the air."
