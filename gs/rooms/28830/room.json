    "description": [
      "Towering above the high point of the rocky plateau, an immense jade effigy stands atop a plinth of slick black stone heavily overgrown with fleshy fungi.  The smoothed stone before the great plinth is spattered with effluiva and littered with countless burning candles.  Dancing light from the candles makes it seem as if the statue's carved shift is stirring in the air currents of the cavern.  Stone steps proceed to the east and west, with steeper ones meandering down toward the low point of the ragged plateau."
