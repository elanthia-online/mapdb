      "Wrinkled vines of blackened foliage snake through the fence encircling a group of empty homes, consuming the spaces as they cling to the crumbling walls.  The vein-like appendages creep up through the holes in the thatch roofing, grasping upwards into the empty air, the vines casting undulating shadows into the dwellings below."
