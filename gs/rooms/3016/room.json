      "This round tunnel through the ice twists and turns towards an upward slope.  The shimmering ice crystals are nearly blinding in their beauty, their light dancing across the remains of a fallen statue lying near one wall.  The statue may have been beautiful in its day, but now lies scattered in pieces on the floor."
