      "A sun-bleached mat of woven rushes, curling slightly at one corner, lies in front of a whitewashed mistwood counter stacked high with various fabrics.  To one side, some baskets spattered with bright colors are arranged next to a cabinet, its doors removed and tossed nearby in a corner.  A banana plant in a terracotta pot is framed by a small window with thick panes of tinted blue glass, the leaves of the plant reaching towards the light."
