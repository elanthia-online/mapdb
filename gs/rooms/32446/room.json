      "The flagstones split into two distinct paths, one bending north toward the mouth of a small training yard sheltered by the castle walls.  Overgrown with grasses and weeds, the pathway is uncertain.  A clearer trail toward the castle's entrance leads past a dark tower stationed along the curtain wall."
