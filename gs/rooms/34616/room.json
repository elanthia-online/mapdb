      "Beneath the ominous shadows of basalt statues depicting hooded figures with powerful builds, broad steps climb up to a sprawling terrace in the southeast.  Opposite the figures, a slate-roofed armory occupies the space near the district's outer wall, its yard separated from the cobblestone street by a black steel gate.  Bloodwood trees stand tall along the pathway leading up to the entrance, and every breeze solicits a rain of leaves and carmine blossoms from their high branches."
