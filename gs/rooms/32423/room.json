      "The bridge is a wide span of pale stone that winds gently upward toward the castle.  To either side is a drop of hundreds of feet into a hungry black ravine that plunges between the highlands and their neighboring hills.  Patterns of inlay form intertwining branches of sweetbrier that spiral along the bridge's inner wall."
