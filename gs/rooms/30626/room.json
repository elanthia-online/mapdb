      "Beautiful murals of trees, plants, and various shrubbery are painted on the walls of the curved room giving the illusion of a thick forest.  Large potted ferns, bushes, and plants are stacked about, adding to the scene.  In one corner, a small iron stove is nestled within the greenery, a basket of sticks tucked nearby.  Central in the chamber is a polished white oak table flanked by two long benches."
