      "Vibrant pale ivory carpeting blankets the polished wooden floor of the private chamber.  Centered against one silk-covered wall opposite a silk curtained archway, a pair of small cherry tables set with dark beeswax candles flank a huge cherry estate bed piled high with rich azure pillows.  A dark pomegranate wardrobe rests next to a folding silk screen that partially conceals an elegant leaf-patterned faenor mirror hanging above an ivory marble basin."
