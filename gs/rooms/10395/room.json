      "Pale amber spidersilk curtains frame a row of diamond-shaped windows.  In front of each window stands a uniformed mannequin, jauntily sporting the crimson and gold of the Vaalor military.  The mannequins stand at attention, each clutching a different musical instrument between its fingers, the overall effect resembling a drill band lined up for a parade.  The merchant Ambra stands behind a long thanot counter edged in mithglin, on top of which is a small sign.",
      "Pale amber spidersilk curtains frame several glaesine paned windows.  Each diamond-shaped pane is fashioned of a different colored piece of glaes, and the resulting cascade of hues glimmers across the various instruments displayed on the shop's carved haon shelves.  A long thanot counter edged in mithglin rests along one wall."
