      "Crates packed with colorful textiles litter the carpeted floor.  Gaps in the yierka hide walls allow for occasional muted light to play across ahmdir blue bolts of ridgeweaver silk and simple homespun linens.  An old wooden loom is set against the back wall, flanked on one side by a rickety wooden mannequin and the other by a hay-stuffed linen mannequin."
