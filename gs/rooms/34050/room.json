      "The brilliantly inlaid bridge stretches toward a crystalline dais at the center of the cavern.  To either side, past guarding rails of elegantly carved hoarbeam, is a plummet into the engulfing blackness of the pit below.  Though the chasm's depths are lost to light, the musical rush of water surges up from below in a symphony of splashes and burbles that echo off of the distant subterranean rock."
