      "Situated at the very edge of the frozen river, the small clearing is a combination of gravel and tufts of dead grass mixed into the snow.  A snow-lined gravel trail leads down to the water's edge where dried river reeds bend amid round stones edged by unmoving water.  Set back from the walking space, a domed sinew and hide tent and a birch bark-sided hut have been built among the sassafras and hickory.",
