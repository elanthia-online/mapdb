      "This small room is cast mostly in shadows with the exception being a brightly lit table covered in woodworking supplies that fills the middle of the room with a tall stool half-tucked under the edge.  The rest of the room is packed full of haphazardly stacked crates, cluttered shelves, and overflowing barrels containing every imaginable material needed to craft staffs.  Mounted on the wall just behind the worktable is an expertly crafted bramble runestaff that seems out of place in the chaotic workroom."
