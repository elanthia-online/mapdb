      "Gnarled roots and brambles cluster to the south, home to a vast array of insects and other tiny fauna that flit about the various types of flora here.  Built atop the overgrown path, a platform supports one larger shop while others make do with what support they are afforded.  Narrow pathways wind between the shops and a gap in the tree line leads north into a dense, wooded thicket."
