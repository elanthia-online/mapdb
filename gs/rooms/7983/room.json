    "description": [
      "A weathered stone building is nestled low among tall modwir and weeping willow trees.  A gleaming vultite plaque is affixed to the dark, wrought iron fence which surrounds and defines the grounds, through which formally clipped hedges and an elegant fountain in the midst of a rose garden are visible.  Beyond the wrought iron gate, a red-carpeted walkway covered by a long, narrow awning leads up to massive double doors.",
      "Clouds scuttle across the harvest moon, their shapes reminiscent of ghastly images seen only in fevered dreams.  In the dim light, you see a battered plaque dangling from a rusty spike on the wrought iron fence.  Swirling about your feet, a blanket of mist lines what appears to be a freshly dug grave.  A crooked tree grabs desperately at the sky and you can see the flickering silhouette of a broken-down house through tortured branches.  A cobblestone walkway leads back to the square."
