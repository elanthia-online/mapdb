      "Where the driftwood stairsteps do not intrude on the blue-painted walls, trophies from the sea hang on marvelous iron hooks.  The curiosities extend onto pedestals on the floor and crowd the area in a manner resembling a shipwreck; items tumble at different heights in random abandon.  The northern bridge extends to the next tower, while a similar perpendicular bridge leads west."
