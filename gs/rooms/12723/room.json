      "Broken statuary has been imbedded in the walls and floor, wrenched from the small alcoves that housed them and flung about by some great force.  Intermingled between torsos, arms, and legs are remnants of the muraled ceiling and roof that once towered overhead.  A slender iron rack with a bright green patina has been twisted into a ghost of its former self."
