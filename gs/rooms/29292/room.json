      "Clinging to the wall by one hinge, an off-white door with a glassless round window, hangs open and allows entry through a dark hole in the wall.  Half-melted candles are piled in waxen lumps that stretch from the tarnished railing in a half-circle to where one of the door's lower corners gouges the decking."
