      "Vibrant crepuscular sunrays pierce through a large lor-framed bay window illuminating a cluttered glowbark desk alongside a stout mithril alloy footlocker.  Pulsating mana whirls throughout the workshop, inducing the prickling sensation of static on one's skin.  Resting atop a granite fireplace is a sephwir dart board surrounded by a pair of overstuffed bookcases and several shelves scattered with a myriad of colorful alchemical components.",
