      "Cubby holes line this entire room, each one holding within them a different set of jousting gear.  Colorful ribbons dangle from the exposed trusses above.  Some of them look brand new, while others are tattered and faded from time.  Large, woven jute sacks hang from wooden pillars placed at the front and back of this room."
