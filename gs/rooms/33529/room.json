      "Separating the working space from the customer space, a long oak table supported by blackened iron legs is covered with a bright yellow tablecloth and covered with various beverages.  Beyond the table are several tripods holding aloft kettles and cauldrons as they gently simmer over carefully banked fires built just beyond the edges of the stall's canvas awnings and walls.  The blended scent of cinnamon, coffee, and caramel fills the air."
