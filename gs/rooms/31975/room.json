      "Light seeps through the thin cracks between the rough pine walls of the hovel, some filled with bits of bog moss and others with fragrant rushes.  Uneven floors creak and groan as if the tiny structure were moaning under the weight of an enormous burden, though the sparse furnishings consist of little more than a few baskets and a wooden dress rack.  A small fire, banked but still quite luminous, offers a modicum of light to those nearby."
