      "The air is still and silent in this dimly-lit space.  Several ornately carved stone coffins, probably containing dead ancestors of the castle's lords, lie under thick blankets of dust here.  A thick, swirling mist blankets this room almost completely, only briefly wavering to reveal a dark stone monolith towering silently in the center of the room."
