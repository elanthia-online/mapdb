      "This part of the hovel is spare, with all surfaces painted a snowy white.  There were once windows, but they have been boarded over with white-painted driftwood that is further colored by the silhouette of a vivid vermillion marionette.  In the room's center, two stone sarcophagi sit side-by-side, each large enough to comfortably fit a small child.  Each sarcophagus is a different color and is draped with bright linens.  A wide brass plaque is affixed to the wall on one side of the room.  A battered driftwood door leads out."
