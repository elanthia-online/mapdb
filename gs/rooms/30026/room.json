      "Gilt scales glisten from the far wall of the hollow, picking out the sinuously muscled curves of a golden dragon depicted above a primitive altar of wrought iron and gilt.  Flames from the braziers at the hollow's perimeter reflect off of the surface of the metal, making the beast look as if it is writhing in the ruddy light.  A pair of solid golden double doors proceed beneath the dragon's spread wings.",

Flames from the braziers at the hollow's perimeter reflect off of the surface of the metal, making the beast look as if it is writhing in the ruddy light.  The fire's heat is blistering and cruel in stark contrast to the whistling, knife-edged gale outside the tree."
