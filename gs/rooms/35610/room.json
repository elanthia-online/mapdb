      "Though most of the main deck below has been consigned to the sea, an expanse of the upper deck stands unbroken despite the endless assault of storms and salt.  Rust-streaked rails have begun to succumb to the onslaught, corrosion having eaten holes into their bases that will undermine them entirely, in time.  The planks of the deck, once sanded fine and protected by smooth varnish, are warped and buckled in places, slick with algae and strands of kelp."
