      "As the passageway circumnavigates a huge outcropping of blood-red glaes it rises and falls in a hazardous pitch, like storm-tossed ocean waves.  Reflections from inside the mineral cast a low reddish glow over the tunnel's progress.  The smell of sulfur is mixed with another odor so strong and noxious, it makes the sulfur seem palatable."
