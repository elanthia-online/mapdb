      "Several hurricane lanterns hang from the paneled wooden ceiling, the flames within casting light and shadows across the cabin.  Rich pine borders the edges of the walls, adding a decorative touch and feel to the cabin that is lacking elsewhere in the ship.  A large pine table bolted to the deck sits at the center with a heavy chair behind it, while a large bunk fills the deck space beneath the grimy stern windows."
