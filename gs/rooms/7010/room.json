      "This round tower marks the intersection of the northern and eastern walls of the outer keep.  Although it was once patrolled by many strong guards, the tower is now home to only a few blades of grass which struggle to grow in the cracks between the stones.  The parapets run along the walls to the west and south here, and some steps lead down into the tower."
