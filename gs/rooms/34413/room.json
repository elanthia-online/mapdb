      "Lining the walls of this spacious room, floor to ceiling shelves are filled with every variety of book, journal, and manuscript imaginable.  Several cushioned chairs rest in front of a large, arced window draped in sheer silk, that looks out over the lush jungle.  Resting to either side of a curtained archway, a pair of candelabra stands ready to add light to the spacious library."
