      "Braided wool forms a circular rug at the center of the hide ger, its muted strands arranged in tight spirals.  Copper lanterns hang from the roof poles above, their surfaces marked by gentle hammering.  Along the curved wall, a woven grass basket rests beside a low crate that supports a neat pile of prayer rugs.  Further around the curve, a carved wooden box sits on a hide-draped stand, its surface cut with simple, deliberate patterns."
