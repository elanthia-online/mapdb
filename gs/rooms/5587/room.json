      "A verdigrised bronze brazier rests atop a roughly-shaped granite altarstone in the center of this small beehive-vaulted chamber.  Fluttering in the drafts that easily find their way through flagstone walls, a brass-bound felwood torch burns brightly in a polished mithril stand to one side.  An oilskin worked with jet and gold beads hangs from a hook beneath the torch."
