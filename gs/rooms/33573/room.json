      "Several wooden planks line the back of the tent, serving as workstations for creating colorful pigments.  A particularly wide shelf has been neatly stocked with a multitude of glass jars holding raw materials: flowers, berries, vegetables, and an assortment of minerals.  Set off to the side, a few colorful cloths are neatly folded and displayed on a short wooden rack."
