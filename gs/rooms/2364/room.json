      "Cold fog prowls along the cobblestones, so thick that travelers of shorter stature might be entirely engulfed by its dense banks.  It eddies away from the gated entrance of a villa set back from the street.  The entrance is chained shut and there are piles of construction materials stacked outside.",
      "A low, dense, cold fog blankets everything.  In some places a halfling could walk with only his or her head sticking above the eerie fog."
