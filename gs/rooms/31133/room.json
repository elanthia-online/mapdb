      "Crystal mobiles hang before open windows sending rainbows skittering across sky blue walls.  Countless hastily-penned musical scores, half-finished limericks and just-begun stories cover the floor and furnishings.  What little can be seen of the actual decor reveals a twig canopy bed from which hang lengths of trailing white silk that stir in the breeze, a small unadorned vanity containing but a single hair brush, and a writing desk which seems to be the source of the parchment explosion."
