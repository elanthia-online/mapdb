    ],
    "description": [
      "Small fishing vessels are moored to the dock by brittle lengths of rope that creak with the rise and fall of the waves.  Devoured by salt and and compromised by neglect, they have begun to take on water, and several silver fish dart around in the lower third of the nearest.  Some woven baskets cram the uneven planks of the dock near where it meets the shore, emitting a horrific, sour stench."
