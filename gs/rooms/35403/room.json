      "Soft grey canvas walls enclose the modest space, their edges weighted to steady the structure upon the marble tile floor.  To one side, a wooden booth stands with a slanted writing surface and a small slot for casting votes.  Faint scuffs mar the tiles beneath, evidence of many footsteps passing through the temporary shelter, and a single lantern hangs from the peak, casting a soft glow through the fabric and leaving the corners dim."
