      "This short tunnel is cramped and dark save for light illuminating the shapes of arched openings that appear at the northern and southern ends.  A hint of fungus mingles with the mineral scents of the cool, yet mildly humid, air.  Footsteps echo through the tunnel as the darkened silhouettes of dwarves pass from arch to arch."
