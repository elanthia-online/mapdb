      "A series of freestanding arches looms over a wide path of tightly interlocked stones.  The path runs straight and true from the polished silver gates to the north to a stairway that drops off to the south.  Outside the arches crushed red brick covers the ground inside the white limestone walls.  Cacti of different shapes and sizes reside in large earthenware pots, and here and there small stone rabbits sit rigidly still.  A brightly blazing torch extends from the side of each arch.",
