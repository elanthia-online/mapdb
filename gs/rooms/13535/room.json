      "Refurbished driftwood walls rise from a water-stained light pine floor.  Just above an old lobster pot hangs a circular fishing net, and a dark and light oak ceiling completes the picture.  A brass treasure chest and a simple wire frame mannequin stand side by side in the middle of the room."
