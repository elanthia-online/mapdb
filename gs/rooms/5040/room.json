      "The plank walkway turns a corner to the east and heads south into Marshtown.  To the west, the boardwalk approaches a seafood eatery.  The eatery sits some distance above the water level, anchored on the north to a hill that rises out of the marsh.  The south of the building is secured to tall, thick pilings that have been driven deep into the marsh."
