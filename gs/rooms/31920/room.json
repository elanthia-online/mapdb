      "Stained glass globes illuminate the curtain-covered shop, the tiny votives dancing within the spheres as they cast shadows across a fine-grained haon display nestled between twin cages of pewter wire.  Leather-bound volumes lay open across a circular table in the center of the room, the bestiaries' illustrations replicated in sketchings pinned to the vertical planks comprising the walls.  Faint howls and chirps seem to emanate from a group of talismans hung on the far wall, fading into the din of the shop."
