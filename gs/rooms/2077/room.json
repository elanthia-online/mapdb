    "description": [
      "An odd outcropping of rock stands tall here at the western edge of the village, shaped something like a huge hand.  It seems to be holding back the oppressive tide of the dense forest to the west, or perhaps it is a warning to those in the village to proceed no further.  A certain irony looms here, near this now dead village, in the form of a cold grey mausoleum, which seems to offer vague, frightening promises as you pass."
