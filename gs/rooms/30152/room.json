      "Propped on massive cabers sunk deep into the bed of the Mistydeep, this large teak deck stretches over the river and provides an impressive view of the valley below.  Several adjustable wooden chairs with padded crimson cushions surround a stone-lined firepit and a rhimar-lined chest.  A fishing pole sits in the corner, leaning casually against a colorful pot of tulips, sunflowers, and daisies.",
      "Propped on massive cabers sunk deep into the bed of the Mistydeep, this large teak deck stretches over the river and provides an impressive view of the moonlit valley below.  Adjustable wooden chairs with padded crimson cushions surround a stone-lined firepit and a rhimar-lined chest.  Several torches spaced along the railing flicker in the darkness, casting dancing shadows around the area."
