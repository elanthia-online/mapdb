      "The peaked ceiling of the pavilion is held aloft by a series of interlocking bracers and beams, from which dangle strings of hollowed glaes orbs illuminated from within by tiny candles.  Though each is small, the tiny candle flames have warmed the air, and the spicy-sweet scents of cardamom and vanilla waft throughout the area.  A brass-hinged trunk sits open off to one side of the walkway, while a crooked tree branch boasting bronze hooks is mounted along one linen wall, displaying a variety of goods."
