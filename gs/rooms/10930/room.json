      "The walls of Tibek Alley are pocked with a riot of shapes, carved with Onaresque symbols and now-indistinct script.  Homes lining the narrow way are bunched together, standing locked in an attitude of attention like hapless soldiers unable to stand at ease.  The crowds have thinned here to a mere dribble, waning as the lane proceeds into shadow."
