      "Frozen dew clings to the southern verdure, evocative of shattered crystal sprinkled over the swelling vista.  Rife with loose granite stones, the uneven path snakes between gilt-washed wagons adorned with obsidian cabochons, scaly wastesdragon skins pulled taut over their arched tops.  Little plum bitterroot thrives in the surrounding grasses, its salmon-brushed blossoms cradled by compact rosettes of thick evergreen leaves."
