      "An ancient stone arch rises over the dimly lit street, devoid of any associated architecture.  Climbing roses cover its bluish-grey surface, twining over and around the masonry in sinuous green and white patterns.  Newer buildings crowd up to the older construction, juxtaposing freshly cut, sharp angles against the softened, time-worn stone of old.",
