      "Arching over the pier, a dark, navy blue awning ripples in the light seaborne breeze that dances across the surrounding ocean waters.  A series of steps, guarded by local militia, descends to a private dock along the western edge opposite the arm of Pier 3, while painted arrows upon the golden planks point to the north and south for Piers 1-2 and 4-5 respectively.  Piteous and plentiful, the cry of gulls fills the air."
