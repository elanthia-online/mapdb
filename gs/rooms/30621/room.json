      "Wooden panels generously covered in whitewash line the walls of the curved hallway.  Protecting the corridor is a railing of thick cast iron chain links that thread through carved oak supports.  A smooth driftwood door carved with a leaping dolphin is set into the wall near a spiral ascending staircase.  Imbedded with bits of sea glass, a stone archway leads into a shadowed chamber."
