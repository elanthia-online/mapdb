      "Cresting the top of the hill, the path continues turning west past an abandoned thatched roof hut.  Makeshift flowerboxes have been placed at the entrance to the hut, each brimming with a combination of withered flowering plants and tall weeds.  A broken-handled hoe leans against the hut seemingly holding the structure from collapsing to the ground.  A wicker chair sits next to the hut, using an overturned watering can as a replacement for a broken leg.",

Makeshift flowerboxes have been placed at the entrance to the hut, each brimming with a combination of withered flowering plants and tall weeds.  Outside the hut a couple of lanterns hang, lighting the area quite brightly.  A broken-handled hoe leans against the hut, seemingly holding the structure from collapsing to the ground."
