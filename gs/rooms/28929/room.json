    "description": [
      "Thick oak planks stretch to the west, the smooth boards creating a walking space that traverse viscous mud that dominates that area of the colony.  Rough-cut railings, fashioned of smaller trees stripped of their bark, form a protective barrier along the edge of the cliff, terminating against the stockade fence to the north and a variety of logging machinery to the south.  A set of stairs descends to a small plateau in the cliff face, a large oak sign offering caution for descent."
