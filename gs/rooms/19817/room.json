      "A single glassy black pool stretches across the floor, its mirror-like surface unbroken by any ripples.  Dim light does little to illuminate the hall, the candle's wavering flames casting the surroundings in a moody glow.  Dark velvet banners flutter above, stitched with the image of the deep crimson Lornon moon in each of its phases.  A silence hangs over the area, broken only by the occasional soft footstep upon the unadorned marble floor."
