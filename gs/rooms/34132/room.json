      "Standing on this side of the chasm, about half a dozen felled trees are visible behind those that dangle over the ledge.  Perfect footprints are filled with muddy water along the pathway.  Off in the distance, only the thatched roof of a cottage is visible as white smoke wafts lazily into the air from its smokestack."
