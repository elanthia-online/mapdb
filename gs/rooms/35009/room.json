      "The promontory broadens toward its southernmost extreme, curling like a crooked finger as it stretches out over the frigid main.  White-capped waves slap at the shores below in rumbling counterpart to the high-pitched cries of seabirds.  To the southeast stands a lighthouse with a dark stone facade, a solitary watcher over the forbidding shores."
