    "description": [
      "Black trees snatch at the cold sky along the wall of the small estate.  Dead or dying, the plants of the yard are mostly buried by snowfall, though the space before a small shrine in the shadow of the trees is mostly clear.  The manse has fallen into disrepair and not a hint of light beckons from cracked windows hidden behind heavy boards meant to keep out intruders.  Along its facade, a trio of slashes are gouged out of the masonry as if an animal's claws have sliced through the stone."
