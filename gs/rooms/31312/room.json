      "A large oak tree overhangs the well-trodden path in this area, with its boughs stretching out over a large pond as well.  A near-constant chirping can be heard from the bowels of the mighty tree, occasionally accompanied by the flutter of wings against leaves.  At the base of the tree, a few wary squirrels hunt for food while remaining alert and ready to dash away at any sign of trouble."
