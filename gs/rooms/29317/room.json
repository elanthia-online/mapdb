      "The heavy smell of leather is nearly overwhelming in the stagnant air of this small space.  A small desk and worktable sit near the rear of the store, both haphazardly covered with swatches and discarded pieces of leather.  A motley arrangement of guttering candles in simple wrought iron holders dots the walls at irregular intervals, allowing just enough light to peruse the wares for sale without revealing too much of what lies in the dusty corners."
