      "Myriad painted vines along the walls are covered by actual rose vines that wend their way through chinks in the ceiling to writhe across the interior, dripping lush, overpoweringly scented roses and covered in vicious thorns.  A makeshift arch pushes the voracious verdancy away from a battered and scratched wardrobe and a widowwood-set cabinet, but a rose-painted birch shelf is thronged by a persistent cluster that rains rose petals into a crimson-stained box below.  A few enterprising offshoots are making their way across the floor in a vegetative attempt at dominance."
