    "description": [
      "A squat slate-shingled building with a silver coin-emblazoned sign over the entrance sits at precise angles to the cobblestone road, its face decidedly lacking windows which causes it to give off an air of sterility.  Even the manicured lawn is unremarkable and dull.  Unassuming spires hoist lackluster bulbs aloft as they line a simple path that connects the street to the structure.  Opposite, descending steps lead to a view of the canal while cooing blackbirds hover nearby."
