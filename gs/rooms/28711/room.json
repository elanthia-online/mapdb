    "description": [
      "Dimly lit by tallows placed in wrought iron sconces, the small passage has rough wooden walls and a packed dirt floor.  Rickety wooden stairs ascend to the floor above along the western edge, while white-washed oak planks form a descending staircase that disappears below.  A faded curtain outlined in light is the only other means of exiting the space."
