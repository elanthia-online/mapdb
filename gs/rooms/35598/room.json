      "Tangled piles of rigging stained with mildew hide in a small close along the starboard side of the main deck.  Though home to a few scuttling crabs, the heaped lines otherwise make for a hospitable place for the crew to hold court, judging from a pair of jewel-pipped dice and a few corroded coins lost within the coils.  Shaded by the foremast, the deck is spared enough of the sunlight to reveal a faint ghostly glow seeping from the green-grey planks."
