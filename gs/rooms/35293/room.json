      "Despite the lack of airflow, the underground chamber is humid but much cooler than the rooms above.  Marble walls and floors are polished to a high, reflective sheen, allowing the scant handful of shielded lanterns to keep the space in a twilight-like glow.  Hundreds of niches decorate the walls, each filled with large and small urns surrounded by simple offerings of dried flowers, candles, or incense.  A long white bench rests at the center of the chamber, and a set of wall-hugging stone steps provide egress."
