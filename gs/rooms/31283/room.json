      "The sharp tang of freshly honed metal and oil fills the air of this utilitarian wagon.  A simple cotton rug sits along the floor, its color long worn away by heavy traffic.  Overhead, a pair of lit sconces that have been lashed to the bows illuminate the room while a woven wicker basket dangles between them.  Against the wall, a wooden display has been arrayed with a variety of wares that have been neatly organized into rows."
