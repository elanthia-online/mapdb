      "Enormous windows take up each of the four cardinal points in this plain limestone room.  A small pot-bellied stove stands opposite a small round table and a pair of weathered chairs.  Dangling from the oaken rafters is a pair of tiny courier pigeon carriages, their denizens cooing softly in their sleep.",
