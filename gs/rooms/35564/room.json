      "Twisting shelves of stark white limestone ripple outward from a central spire, their edges softened by vibrantly colored sea moss.  Myriad small burrows pepper the base of the walls, some ringed in jewel-toned shells and feathery algae tufts.  Veins of bruised purple mineral run like roots through the limestone floor, their meandering paths forming delicately branching fractals."
