      "The looming shadow of the city's western wall stretches over the run, casting it in shadow.  Small shops of rough pine and stone cling to either side of the roadside, but none seem especially well-to-do, their niche wares attracting only a scattering of patrons.  Passersby move along the road with hasty steps and furtive glances, as if eager to be out of the cold darkness."
