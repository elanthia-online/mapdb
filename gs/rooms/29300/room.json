      "Curling paint clings to the walls, largely due to barnacles imbedded in the wood, while clumps of seaweed create a slick walking space upon a moldy carpet with metallic cording.  To the east and west the passage is blocked by debris and a heavy, unpleasant odor.  A fissure in a northwestern corner is haloed in an eerie green light that spills from a frosted globe wedged into the floor."
