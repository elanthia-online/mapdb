      "Vagrant breezes blowing across the lake to the west carry a cool touch of moisture that settles in a damp blanket across the meadow grass.  The edge of the meadow makes an abrupt drop to the shadowed water below, no gentle shoreline leading down to the water, only a granite ledge that drives back the lapping waves, narrowing the channel through which the water runs.",
