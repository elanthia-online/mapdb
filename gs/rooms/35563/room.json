      "Tall kelp-latticed walls frame the periphery of the expansive shop, the leather-crafted fronds tapering towards the arathiel-cut schools of fish glinting in the ambient light.  Coral-like structures are constructed from a set of pale driftwood hooks, the elongated display set above lacquer-stiff waves crafted from folded bluish green parchment and thin wires."
