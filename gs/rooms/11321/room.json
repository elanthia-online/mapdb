      "Iron cages line the far wall, all strangely distorted in shape and reinforced with silvery vultite wire.  Lumpy sacks of animal feed have been piled in a corner of the room, but the corpses filling the various cages were clearly well-enough fed -- for the rats, kobolds, and other animal corpses are grotesquely large as well as hideously distorted in their features.  Spots of yellow mold grow on some of the corpses, adding a fungal smell to the reek of rotting flesh."
