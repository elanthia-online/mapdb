      "Winding its way through the high grass, the faint animal track is surrounded by tall, scarlet sirenflowers that bend and dip in the light seaward breeze.  Citrus trees speckle the landscape, where several roltons lazily munch the sweet greenery.   Off to the east a small encampment is visible, while to the west the land gives way to abandoned farmlands."
