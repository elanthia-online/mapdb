      "Dark amethyst marble floors are veined with black and silver that twist and turn to resemble roses entwining with harps.  In one corner, a silver bench sits next to a marble fountain, and along the other wall, twin shelves of ebon marble reside above a lavender-veined black marble counter.  An elaborate Loenthran tapestry covers the wall behind the fountain."
