      "[Volcanic Slope, Risky Footing]"
    ],
    "description": [
      "The slope is barely passable, so steep is its incline.  Deep cracks in the granite offer a foothold to a few hardy plants able to withstand the high winds of an occasional squall blowing in from the ocean.  To the east, a panoramic moonlit view of an impressive series of seven waterfalls cascading down the craggy mountainside makes the hazardous climb seem worth the effort.  Below, an equally dramatic view of a geyser field, with its rich, undulating concentric rings of color, can be seen.",
