      "Moonlight highlights the stylized designs across the trefoil-arched windows, the stained glass casting muted colors across their surfaces.  A wrought alum filigree tray is flanked on either side by a tall flora-filled display and crystalline carafes, the items displayed upon a rectangular ebonwood table in the center of the circular room.  Caught high above the room is a tangled chandelier of faenor leaves and carved onyx roses, the fixture interspersed with softly glowing pillar candles."
