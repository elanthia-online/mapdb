    "description": [
      "The cul-de-sac known as Qasr al-Shawg is a quiet one, ringed by tall houses standing closely side-by-side.  A few palm trees arch up from large terra-cotta urns sitting before the residences, their graceful fronds drooping in the heat.  In the center of the cul-de-sac sits a small fountain.  It sends up a small, desultory spray of water, which is tossed about by breezes wafting by."
