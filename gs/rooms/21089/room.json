      "Winding its gentle way through the untamed foliage is a slender footpath covered in crushed, pearly white seashells.  An expanse of large white sailcloth gleams brightly in the sunlight and gently sways in the moisture-laden breeze off in the distance, while just west of here the gentle peaks of the rebuilt monastery can be seen.  Here and there along the path, rainwater collects in the gnarled, exposed roots of the majestic trees that form the leafy canopy above.",
