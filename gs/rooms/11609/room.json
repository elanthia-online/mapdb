      "Bits of flotsam and jetsam lie scattered along the flood tide mark...shattered staves of barrels, broken spars, lengths of sodden rope.  Waves crash against the jagged rocks, sending a huge froth into the air.  The noise of the sea, echoed back by the tall cliffs, is deafening.  A narrow pathway leads up to a rocky shelf in the cliff face."
