      "Cobalt tiled pathways surrounded in bright yellow moss converge upon this small courtyard, which is filled with the soft sound of mechanical buzzing and purring.  At the heart of the space, a half-wall of metallic parrots lifts from the glass-like surface of a small pool of water recessed into the ground.  Rising from the aquatic depths, a beautiful copper statue greets a copper and carnelian sun that is brightly illuminated by some unseen source."
