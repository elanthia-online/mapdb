      "Towering stacks of crates near the rear door of a porch-fronted wooden cabin are more or less neatly arranged, as are a small collection of empty fruit barrels that sit off to one side.  The scent of apples, both fresh and fermenting, is heavy in the air, lending a not entirely unpleasant scent to the area.  Off to the southeast, the land begins to slope gently downward and is marked by a well-trod footpath."
