      "Stacks of wood planks, ranging from ash to zebrawood, are confined within decorative cages of filigreed bronze wire scattered along the floor.  Heavy oak shelves equally stacked high with supplies line the pine walls, some slightly off-kilter and threatening to fall,  above which hangs a mahogany-framed sign.  Weeping willow branches drape strategically from the ceiling, their leaves shifting almost imperceptibly from the slightest touch.  Arranged within the branches and leaves are tiny lanterns shaped like fireflies."
