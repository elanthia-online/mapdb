      "The pleochroic fire obsidian walls of the observatory arc skywards to support a magnificent glass-domed ceiling that suspends an intricate whirling kelyn orrery.  Commanding the precise center of the spherical expanse, a towering veil iron telescope vigilantly surveys the eternal heavens above.  Etched along the barrel of the telescope are dozens of detailed star charts and elaborate constellation maps, while a complex clockwork astrolabe hangs from its extended black diamond eyepiece.",
