      "A long, low building rests in the center of this open plaza, its roofless walls stretched toward the sun.  Built of light gray granite that is liberally laced with tiny specks of mica, the entire building gleams and sparkles through the leafy interlacing of ivy that covers its length.  Two green columns fashioned in the form of coiled serpents flank the entrance into the structure.  A wide brick walkway leads back to the road."
