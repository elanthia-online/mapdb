      "Blood pools thick and dark on the dais, dripping from and oozing between the blocks of ruddy feldspar in a constant sluggish flow.  The source appears to be a monstrous figure draped across an equally behemothic bier of red-veined white marble.  A quintet of rounded stone pillars supports an ornate roof over the fallen gigas, and each pillar is deeply graven with a downturned scimitar outlined in smeared ash.  Wind barely whispers over the ground, as if even the brazen elements fear the place."
