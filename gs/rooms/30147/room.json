      "The remains of an earlier meal sits atop a wooden table, the tin cups dry, not a drop of rum left.  To each side of the table, a wooden bench is carved with names, dates, and a few crudely drawn maidens.  A rat scurries out from beneath a flour sack dumped in one corner, a one-eyed cat with a clipped tail chasing after it."
