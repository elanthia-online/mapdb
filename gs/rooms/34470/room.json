      "A yellow-tinted mist drifts across the slick stone floor of the narrow crevice, twining in and out of the numerous humanoid skulls stuck to the rock walls with rusted daggers.  Crudely carved beneath the skulls are several pictograms of monstrosities rising from the sea.  A citrine glow emanates from the grotto to the north."
