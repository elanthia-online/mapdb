      "Bright sunlight fills the room.  A large dome of clear crystal encompasses the room, keeping the elements at bay while providing an excellent view of the surrounding forest.  The sea of green below is periodically broken by field or stream, and in the distance one can make out Solhaven Bay and the bustling port around it.",
      "Silver moonlight flows into the room.  A large dome of clear crystal encompasses the room, keeping the chill night air at bay while providing a view of the inky night sky.  The forest below is lit by the moons above and the occasional spark of a firefly.  A small lamp rests near the ladder, and pillows are scattered about for relaxing stargazing."
