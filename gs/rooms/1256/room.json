      "The buzzing of ceaseless activity shows this fallen trunk is far from dead, rather it is teeming with life.  The flurry of activity centers around a beehive clinging to the tree's inner wall.  The warm, sweet smell of clover honey and gathered pollen, and the gentle, purposeful humming of the bees, lull you into a sense of security."
