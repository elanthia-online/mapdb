      "Although the cupola is rather small, the daytime view is spectacular from the eight linden-framed windows centered on each of its cypress panel walls.  A woven cloth hammock is stretched along one side from iron hooks imbedded in two of the corners.  Opposite the trapdoor set into the wooden floor, a stool rests near a carved tanik end table, which proudly displays a spherical glass fishbowl."
