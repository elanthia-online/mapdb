      "Porter Street angles sharply towards the northeast as if veering toward the Silvermule Gaming Hall.  Crowds push past on their way to gamble, krolvin and half-krolvin, giantkin and halflings alike united by the allure of easily attained riches.  Only a few seem to pay any mind to a small snow-covered shop on the corner.  The southern wall of Icemule Trace is just visible down a short lane heading south.",
      "Porter Street angles sharply towards the northeast here, in the direction of the Silvermule Gaming Hall.  A group of dwarves pushes past you on their way to the Silvermule, obviously intent upon furthering their riches.  Down the short lane heading south, you can just barely see the stone wall forming the border of the Trace."
