      "Small and compact, the scullery is surrounded by tidy shelves and marble counters with birdseye maple cupboards beneath.  Forested globes are housed beneath the lowest of the shelves, illuminating a cutting board, soapstone basin, and a series of stove-topped ovens.  A bright white door in the northern wall leads outside."
