      "Braying barks fill the air, rising from a bob of indolent seals who have claimed the black sand beach as their own.  Nearby, but still at a safe distance from the eyes of the judgmental pinnipeds, an open-air workroom has been constructed from pine and pitch on a short dock jutting over the water.  Several damaged boats are moored or dry-docked close to the structure."
