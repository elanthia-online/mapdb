      "Cut out openings along the walls allow for the ocean breeze to spill into the room, bringing with it the scents of saltwater and tropical blooms.  Several carved benches and observation lenses have been placed next to the openings, affording a stunning view of the island and sea below.  Set into the floor, sandstone bricks have been placed meticulously, creating a swirling seashell pattern."
