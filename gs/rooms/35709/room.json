    "description": [
      "Platforms of rough-hewn meranti planks, held together by lengths of vine and animal sinew, encircle the huge, gnarled bole of the strangler fig tree.  Bridges sprout toward other trees, primitive in construction and questionably safe due to missing planks and fraying supports.  Fallen fruit spatters the planks with sticky patches that swarm with ants, the industrious creatures attracted by the too-sweet scent of the decaying figs."
