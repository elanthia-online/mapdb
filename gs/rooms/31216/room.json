      "The glowing warmth of the honey-colored, oak-paneled walls and ceiling envelop all who enter.  The floor is softly covered in a deep piled moss green carpet.  Illuminated by flickering wall lamps is a large quilter's ring with an unfinished quilt stretched taut within the frame.  Alongside a cozy, overstuffed chair sits a hand-woven basket overflowing with needlework supplies and yarn."
