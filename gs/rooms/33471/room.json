      "The smell of burnt timber and cloth, which is relieved only by the large hole that has been blasted into the roof, permeates the remnants of this shattered workshop.  Large spiderweb cracks radiate outward from the central point of this large, round room.  Throughout, shattered bits of plinite have embedded themselves into the wall, their inner light casting a dull, ethereal glow. In the center, a makeshift platform has been erected and topped with a polished silver telescope."
