      "The antechamber is a circular room open on one side to the courtyard, allowing the sunlight and scents of flowers to stream in.  Grand arched doorways are positioned along the curve of the wall, one to the west and another to the northwest.  A teak bench sits opposite the open side.  Overhead, a large chandelier hangs from the center of the high ceiling, fitted with hundreds of candles.",
