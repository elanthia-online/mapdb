      "Glossy mistwood walls rise from the oak floor.  Just above an open-mawed greater vruul statue hangs a fused sun and moon wall-hanging, and a mistwood beam ceiling completes the picture.  A vine-carved mahogany table and a gold-leafed mistwood cabinet stand side by side in the middle of the room."
