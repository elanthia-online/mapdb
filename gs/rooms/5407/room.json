      "You can see gulls circling in the distance off toward the north and you can smell the salty odor of the nearby Darkstone Bay, but you cannot see the bay from this vantage point.",
      "The night air is filled with the salty tang of the sea.  The faintest sound of breaking waves and ebbing tides can be heard from the north where Darkstone Bay rests, lulling the animals to sleep."
