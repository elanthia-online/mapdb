      "Rich, dark cherry paneling encompasses this spacious room, dominated by an oversized four poster bed and a large armoire.  Nightstands on each side of the bed hold matching brass oil lamps.  A black marble fireplace is flanked by floor-to-ceiling bookcases, while a pair of comfortable-looking wing chairs face it.  A suit of armor stands guard over a small walnut writing desk nestled into one corner, and ivory damask drapes frame a large picture window through which starlight softly filters."
