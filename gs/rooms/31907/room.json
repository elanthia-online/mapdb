      "The ground floor of the tower is paneled in roughly hewn dark hardwoods and smooth, exposed riverstone.  Thousands of tiny facets of glimmering saewehna gems stud the ceiling overhead, arranged in patterns of constellations.  A thick engraved modwir shelf full of books runs along a section of the wall.  Arranged atop a massive tanik dresser are a mithril necklace stand and an engraved mistwood jewelry box.  A small curio cabinet displays a gold-banded keepsake chest."
