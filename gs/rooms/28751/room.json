      "Enclosed by painted white plaster walls, the shop features a glass-fronted bookcase in the center of its dark oak floor.  An oil-filled copper sconce hangs under the white stucco ceiling.  Right near the front is a narrow glass-topped table and a heavy lead glass display case.",
      "Painted white plaster walls rise from a white limestone floor.  Just above an elegantly dressed maiden statue hangs an ornately rendered clan crest, and a viridian Vornavian silk ceiling completes the picture.  Some wrought-iron hooks and a hammered copper hanging rack stand side by side in the middle of the room."
