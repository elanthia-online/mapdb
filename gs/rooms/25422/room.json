      "The room is small, but filled with a number of book-laden shelves.  Several simple wooden chairs, which fill the room with the scent of fresh construction, offer sitting spaces for those wishing to partake in the library's offering.  A writing desk is set to one side with a stack of clean papers, inkwells, and quills, a station for soldiers wishing to write home to loved ones."
