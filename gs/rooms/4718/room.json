      "The road skirts the top of a long ridgeline that runs northeast/southwest.  Below, a vast deciduous forest occupies a valley to the southwest.  Many of the trees are adorned in fall colors of crimson and gold, while large patches are still bright green.  In comparison, the forest to the west is totally evergreens.  Needles in dark greens and blues dominate, and the color never changes unless severe conditions force the needles to become yellow or brown.",
      "The road skirts the top of a long ridgeline that runs northeast/southwest.  Below, a vast deciduous forest occupies a valley to the southwest.  Many of the trees are dappled in various shades of grey, while large patches are still one solid medium grey.  In comparison, the forest to the west is totally evergreens.  Needles in dark greys dominate, and the shade never changes unless severe conditions force the needles to die."
