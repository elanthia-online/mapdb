      "Carved into the limestone balustrades of the bridge's side walls, miniature elven warriors stand sentinel in the stone, worn by years of weather.  Each of the carved warriors holds a shield bearing the crest of House Vaalor.  The crenellated walls of Ta'Vaalor, stretching around the island as far as the eye can see, are punctured only by the gaping maw of the Victory Gate."
