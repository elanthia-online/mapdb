    "description": [
      "The malodorous mire to the north is barely distinguishable from the boggy soil on either side of the pathways.  The mire is fed by a thin, reed-choked creek that curls to the northeast.  An acrid miasma, harsh on the eyes and the nose, emerges from the mire.  Many of the slowly-dying trees in the forest are nearly entirely wound around with brown, dead vines.  To the northeast, barely visible through the fog, the barest hint of a wooden structure can be seen beside the creek."
