      "Tiered shelves of silvery wood sprout organically from the varnished maoral walls, the crystalline bottles of oil arranged atop them gleaming only slightly brighter than the smooth maoral.  The air is heavy with a melange of spice and sweetness, although silk-draped windows let in the fresh sea breeze to leaven the scents."
