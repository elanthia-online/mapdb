      "Thick blades of overgrown grass sway sporadically in the errant coastal breezes, their seed-laden heads filling the air with a wheaty scent that is a reprieve from the rot of most areas of the keep.  Faint trails, where once travelers roamed, still mark the area beneath the watchful gaze of the wall, though they are interrupted by the various stones that have tumbled free of their nesting places."
