      "Slipping through a red-speckled carpet of bearberry shrubs, a serpentine track follows the wide curve of the northeastern hillock.  Peaked tents draped in jewel-toned bourde are staggered along the verdant slope amid sunlit sprays of blooming snow gentian.  Shielded baskets filled with fire shed a comfortable heat throughout the area, the flames within hissing and snapping in defiance to the ever-present alpine winds.",
