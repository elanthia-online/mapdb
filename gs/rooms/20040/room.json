      "Lava pours from the walls in giant waves, falling into a river that pools around the stone bridge then moves deeper underground.  The heat is intense, assaulting your skin and burning your lungs.  Small totemic statues of each of the gods and goddesses of Lornon hang from the ceiling, blackened and singed by rising soot."
