      "Rows of crystal glasses hang from a rack above a carved teak bar that runs the length of the room, while twin arcing windows stand behind it and are draped in curtains of thick silk that mute the natural light.  A variety of inviting tables are scattered around a small wooden stage; shadows dance across the surface from flickering copper wall sconces hung about.  A large marble statue stands to one side of the archway and looms over the room, its face chiseled with an expression of approval."
