      "Evenly spaced along the eerily quiet road, lampposts with cracked glass panes fail to provide any warm illumination.  The only vibrancy in this dark place comes from the burnt orange oxidization enveloping the iron bars in the sparse windows of a sturdy grime-smeared jail.  A bearded axe is buried deep in a stained execution block atop the platform of a wooden gallows.  From the weathered wood crossbeam, a trio of nooses hangs over the open trap door."
