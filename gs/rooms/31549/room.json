      "Moonlight streams through a brilliant rose window casting radiant colors upon the obsidian stone floor of the chamber.  The expansive library rises three stories high, each tier lined with dark shelves filled with every size, shape, and color of book, scroll and folio.  A single, spiraling iron staircase connects each level."
