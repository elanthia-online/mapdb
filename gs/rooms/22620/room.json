      "Held up by smooth ironwood poles, the dark velvet of the tent drapes to the ground in soft ripples.  A pair of frosted crystal globes is suspended from the ceiling by bronze chains.  Crimson, verdant, and gold silk wind about each support before being knotted together and allowed to hang to the floor.  A trio of mannequins is centered in the room between the posts."
