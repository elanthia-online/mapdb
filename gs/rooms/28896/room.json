      "Sunlight and a cool sea breeze laden with the scent of dog roses and salty air dance across the rough oak railing that lines the southern edge of the cobblestone, the barrier blocking the casual passersby from an accidental slip while doing little to nothing to prevent curious adventures from seeking the rocky shoals beyond.  A large two-story warehouse dominates the northern view of the open-air market beyond, the sound of hammering and yelling spilling into the road.",
