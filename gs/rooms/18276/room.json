      "Continuing its journey through the congested trees and vegetation of the jungle, the natural stream of the moonlit river cuts through the rich soil with ease.  Giant water lilies float passively within the current, and the muted amethyst blooms of water hyacinths rest within the shadowed protection of the ribbed water lettuce leaves.  The chorus of crickets calling to each other escapes from large stands of bamboo that cluster along the banks on either side in thick clumps of grassy reeds.",

Giant water lilies float passively within the current, and the muted amethyst blooms of water hyacinths flourish in the cradled protection of ribbed water lettuce leaves.  Large stands of bamboo cluster along the banks on either side in thick clumps of grassy reeds."
