      "Violet-tinged stone walls are dotted with dark green moss, and phosphorescent fungi in wrought iron holders cast the room in a dim glow.  Set up along one wall, an oversized circular board sits upright, with a series of pulleys and gears visible behind it.  A mossy stone box filled with daggers, dirks, and other sharp-bladed instruments sits off to one side, a carved ghostwood sign sticking out of it.  Tucked into a dark corner is a merry-go-round figurine surrounded by tiny, glowing crimson toadstools.Violet-tinged stone walls are dotted with dark green moss, and phosphorescent fungi in wrought iron holders cast the room in a dim glow.
