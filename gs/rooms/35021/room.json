      "The road swerves around snowy hills as it slowly descends toward flatland.  Rich volcanic soil has given rise to vegetation as abundant as it is hardy.  Grasses in waves of red and green cascade down the hillsides.  Seemingly heedless of the snow, bright-colored flowers peek their heads out of the groundcover in vivid patches of violet, periwinkle, and fuchsia.  The mountains in the distance are jagged, white-capped, and severe by comparison."
