    "description": [
      "Tangles of light throb and die within the cores of two huge crystalline pillars flanking a ramp.  Descending from the rugged gallery of natural rock above, the slope joins with a sprawling plaza of peculiar stone.  The material is riddled with large pores and does not evidence any seams or joining mortar.  It forms wild bridges and tiered terraces with lopsided geometries and strange curvature, all congregating around a mountainous crystal in the center of the phantasmagorical grotto."
