      "Immense grey pavilions dominate the area, many collapsed and exposed to flame and sword.  Racks of mechanical crossbows sit untouched between the structures, their once polished surfaces now left in a rusty disarray.  The shredded flaps of one building expose swiftly moving shadows, the faint sound of moaning fading in and out of existence."
