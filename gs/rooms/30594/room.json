      "Whitewashed wooden planks make up the walls of the stable, each fitted together tightly and secured with nails to protect the interior from the elements.  Racks and pegs covered in equipment and tack cover part of one wall with a small side door that leads out to the covered rick-yard.  Stalls rise up from the scuffed floors and line both sides and the back of the stable."
