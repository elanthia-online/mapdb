      "A shallow pond sits in the center of the dense jungle habitat, its surface sparkling brightly from the sunlight that strikes off it.  Several bushes fill the floor of the stone enclosure, though a few patches of dirt can be glimpsed between the grasses.  A capuchin monkey plays among ground while a fuzzy grey gibbon sits upon a stone ledge nearby.",
