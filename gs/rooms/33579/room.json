      "Dust particles dance in the slivers of sunlight that filter through the aged windows, casting a subdued glow upon the room's contents.  A sprawling wooden table, worn with the marks of countless readers, dominates the center, its surface adorned with stacks of weathered tomes and delicate monocles.  Adjacent to it sits a glass display case, its contents illuminated by a single nightshade purple candle."
