      "Lengths of dark plum brocade are suspended from thin, dark wooden beams, creating elegant walls for the large pavilion.  A hexagonal crystal lantern hangs from a thin metal chain in each corner of the area.  Woven flax mats threaded with pale grey hues cushion the floor.  Filling the shop are racks and stands displaying a wide variety of items."
