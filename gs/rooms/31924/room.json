      "The bright white light of a low-hanging chandelier is muted some by its etched and frosted globes, the whole assemblage hanging low over a squared oak dining table.  While the glass-fronted cupboards that line the room display a collection of fine silver and porcelain, the table itself is unset, and is covered with a pile of papers and ledgers.  A swinging door leads elsewhere, a pair of glass double doors lead outside into a courtyard, and a narrow archway leads into the entryway of the cottage."
