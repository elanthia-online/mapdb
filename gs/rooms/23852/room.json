      "Large cushions are stacked against the walls of the foyer, each stack of a varying size.  Scattered throughout the foyer are a couple dimly burning metal sconces, offering light to a single orange hook, a single green hook, and a black mannequin.  A makeshift wooden arch offers entry to a second wagon connected by a series of overlapping planks."
