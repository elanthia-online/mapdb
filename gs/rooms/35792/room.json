      "The cabin has curved walls and a low ceiling that creaks with the rhythm of the sea.  A set of tall, paned windows look out over the ship's aft, allowing sunlight to spill in by day and moonlight to gleam on the polished brass fittings by night.  In the center sits a broad oak desk, strewn with navigational charts, a compass, and a brass candleholder with stubs of wax.  To one side, a bunk is fastened to the wall, fitted with a thick mattress draped in wool blankets and a richly embroidered coverlet."
