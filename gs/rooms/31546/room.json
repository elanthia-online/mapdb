      "Round and cylindrical in shape, the chamber is unadorned except for a glowing malachite-hued column rising high in the center.  The white walls and floor glitter as the pale green light reflects off silver flecks of the stone.  Shadows flicker about as a shimmering ray of energy shifts and moves upon itself."
