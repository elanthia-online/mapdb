    "description": [
      "What remains of a crude wooden hut lies slumped against a jagged boulder, splintered beams and shredded reed thatch scattered haphazardly across the ground.  A fetid puddle of rancid liquid oozes from within the wreckage, where splintered planks and scattered straw mats are slick with decaying fruit that smells strongly of sour fermentation.  The crudely made structure appears to have fallen from the branches of a great tree shading the area."
