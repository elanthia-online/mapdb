      "The boardwalk widens at this point to a circular-shaped gathering area, almost a town square.  Many folks loiter about on the docks or on benches, watching the ships and sailors at their work.  To the northwest sits a chandler's shop, the center of most of the commotion in the area.  Supplies are brought in and out of the building almost constantly.",
