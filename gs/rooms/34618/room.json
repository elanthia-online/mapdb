      "Smoke belches, black and thick, from the limestone chimney of a smithy hunching beneath the outer wall of the town.  Framed by a pair of old weeping willows with round lanterns hung from their branches, the shop stands at the end of a neat lane that winds beneath the stooped trees.  Several carts of dark metal ingots rest outside the smithy's arched entrance."
