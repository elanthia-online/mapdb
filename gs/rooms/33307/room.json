      "Walls of ivory watered silk framed in gold-washed pearwood define this small, elegant salon.  A few settees are clustered in the center of the room, providing rest for feet weary from dancing.  A bird's-eye maple vanity covered with an assortment of small vials and canisters runs along one wall, lined with a row of oval-backed chairs facing mirrors lit by bright wall sconces."
