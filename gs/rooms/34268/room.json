      "Chrysalises crowd the surface of the terrace in ghastly clumps.  Their coriaceous surfaces are sheened with slimy moisture, and swollen larvae swarm among them mindlessly.  Illumination from nearby growths of crystal filters through the vaporous gloom, turning the quivering pods into obscene shadows."
