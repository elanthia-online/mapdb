      "Several varieties of animal skin rugs compete for floor space with piles of hides, mats and pillows.  The overall effect gives the room a rugged, yet cozy, feel.  With floor space so limited, some of the finer rugs have been mounted on the walls for ease of display and to add room for more samples."
