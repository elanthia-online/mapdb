      "Rows of cushioned seats fill viewing boxes that are arranged all around a large arena.  Beautifully embroidered canopies are pulled back allowing the moonlight to bath the area in a pale glow.  A shimmering wall of magical energy protects each booth while still giving a clear view of the trial space."
