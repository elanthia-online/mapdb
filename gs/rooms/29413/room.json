      "A silk canopy hangs high overhead, supported by stained oak poles along the pavilion's perimeter.  Running the length of one wall stands a polished applewood table, its finely crafted wares on display.  A plush blue Vornavian silk carpet lays underfoot, providing comfortable footing, and extends along the ground into the other parts of the pavilion."
