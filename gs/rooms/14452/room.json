      "A huge length of driftwood serves as the counter, its surface unpolished and quite rough.  Stools padded with leather offer comfortable seating, though the material is slashed in some places and the legs look like they've been mended more than once.  Shells and various other nautical trinkets hang along the walls, cast in a moody light from several kraken-oil lamps suspended over the counter.  The smell of cooking food wafts from the doors of the southernmost wall."
