      "Light filters intimately through windows of smoky stained glass bearing scenes of the hunt, vivid reds commingling with the glistening golds and silvers of bright weaponry adorning the panes.  A capacious suede couch faces the translucent artwork, framed to either side by a burled maple endtable.  The sweet pungence of pipe smoke has permeated the walls and furnishings, and is a not unpleasant undertone to the aroma of roasting meat wafting from the kitchens."
