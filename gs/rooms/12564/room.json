      "The new growth trees are thick with tropical underbrush, however an opening in the heavy scrub where the path connects with the logging road is already being established through them.  Obviously, either wildlife or two-legged travelers are coming this way on a fairly regular basis.  To the west, the forbidding wall of Greymist stands dense and mysterious."
