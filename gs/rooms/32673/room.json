      "The bedroom is furnished with a comfortable-sized bed crafted of bleached wood.  A soft patchwork quilt covers the bed, woven of soft lambswool.  White linen curtains billow gracefully at the open windows in the pleasant breeze, carrying in the clean smell of a stand of pines outside the sunlit room.  A bronze-accented trunk sits at the bed's foot, placed so that it doesn't obstruct the idyllic woodland scene woven into a wool rug covering the plank floor."
