      "A tall black iron lamppost sits at the intersection of Bramble Street and Dirge Row.  A weathered sign once hung from chains beneath the post's outstretched arm, but rust has eaten through them.  The sign lies in a dying bed of ornamental brambles, devoured by rot.  Tall, greying buildings with broken windows like gouged eyes stare down on the crossing blindly, not a hint of light within."
