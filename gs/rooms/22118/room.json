      "Shelves of colorful bottles line the rounded wall centered within a large circular oak bar.  A variety of crystal drinking glasses hangs upside down from a rack above.  High-backed dark leather chairs scatter about the room, turned away from a curtained archway to focus on a large riverstone fireplace.  A basket of sticks sits to one side, with a well used dart board hanging above.  Next to sliding linden doors, a huge green fern hangs over the edge of the ceramic pot to caress the ivory wool carpeting."
