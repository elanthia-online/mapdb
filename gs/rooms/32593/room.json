      "Sash windows propped open with sticks and wedges line the southern, while a hardpacked threshing floor smoothly transitions from the muddy edges of the barn's entrance to the east.  Oak support posts keep the slanted ceiling aloft and are surrounded by barrels of rainwater and oats.  The soft sound of rustling and snorting is a reminder that animals are housed nearby."
