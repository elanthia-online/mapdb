    "description": [
      "Grey and cracked, the thick planks of the pier are roughly cut.  The structure creaks and groans as the water laps at the pilings, and the gentle breezes brush against it as they traverse the area.  Clumps of water lilies float on the water's surface on either side of the raised wooden platform, their sweet fragrance filling the air with a heady scent.  The pier stretches out deep into the water to the east, finally culminating at a lighthouse."
