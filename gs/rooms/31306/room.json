      "The heady scent of champagne and strawberries assault your senses as shades of purple and pink blend together in a mass array of silks that line the room.  Feathered boas dangle from hooks, their ends holding up rose-gold chandeliers with dark red candles.  Lined against the eastern wall is a display of six mannequins, each dressed in a different gown."
