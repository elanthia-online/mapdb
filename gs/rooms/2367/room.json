      "Shadows stretch long and tenebrous along the crooked span of cobblestones.  Short dark houses lurk down winding drives, their snowy yards guarded by intricately patterns fences of wrought iron.  There is a chill in the air that is not entirely born from the frigid breeze that howls down the lane, moaning low in the spaces between homes.",
      "A constant chilly breeze together with the short dark houses surrounded by intricately patterned wrought-iron fences give you an uneasy feeling about this part of town.  It does not quite feel evil, but there is something disquieting in the air."
