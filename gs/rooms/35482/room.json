      "Colorful glass lanterns are strung across lengths of hemp-entwined heartleaf, the lighting forged into oversized confections highlighting the glass-paned jadewood counter in shades of polychromatic color.  Silk-fringed carpets of canvas flour sacks cover the walnut-planked floor, the ecru-colored fabric embroidered with scattered wildflowers and long-winged butterflies."
