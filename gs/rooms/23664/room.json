      "Rows of tackling dummies line the walls of the room.  Several wooden benches are placed in small clusters, providing a place to rest between exercises.  A rounded iron arch is set into the nearby wall, leading to a small office space which can be glimpsed through the opening.  Two small hallways lead away from this room, and a descending flight of stairs occupies the space between them."
