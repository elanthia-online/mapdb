      "Several varieties of tropical canopy trees tower overhead, vines trailing down their thick trunks and buttressed roots.  A panther-shaped topiary stands to one side of a large wooden building, guarding the entrance.  Some flowering jungle shrubs continue between the structures, creating a natural fence about the guild's outbuildings."
