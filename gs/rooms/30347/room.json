      "Stained to resemble stone, four carved oak giants stand with their backs hunched in support of the low exposed rafter ceiling and their hands holding aloft bronze bowl-shaped braziers.  The heart of the room has an enormous desk-like table, though no chairs are present, where star charts, coastal drawings, and various maps are strewn about.  Round portals dot the walls, between which are housed a bed, armoire, chest, mannequin, and weapon rack."
