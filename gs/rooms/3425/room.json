      "The narrow landing is wrought from the same metal as the staircase, though its surface is grated to provide a glimpse of the street below.  Though thin, the railings seem sturdy enough to support the weight of most humanoids.  Whispers, giggles, and the occasional feather drift onto the landing from an open window at the back of the pub.",
      "You pause at the narrow landing to catch your breath.  To your relief, the thin iron railings are much sturdier than they appeared to be at first glance.  Whispers, giggles, and the occasional feather drift onto the landing from an open window."
