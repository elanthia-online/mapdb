      "Beneath a steeply vaulted ceiling, a vivid krolvin ship mural hangs on one of the polished granite walls.  An oval table of black enamel and an exquisitely carved fel trunk sit in opposite corners while a large sculpture of a knight slaying a small drake rests on an ornate ceramic tile floor."
