      "Oak beams support the riverstone walls and ceiling of the small workroom.  The walls are clear of any greenery, although several small creepers peek through a hole in a glass-inlaid ironwood door.  Several dark stone benches are scattered about a thick rolton wool carpet that is strewn with bits of discarded plants.  Various tools and materials are scattered over the surface of a carved wooden table."
