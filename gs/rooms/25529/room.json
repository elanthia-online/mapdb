      "The starboard gangway of the ship is a precarious path overlooking the bustling activity of the main deck, shielded from a drop overboard only by a red brass railing.  Whirring propellers, spreading from the hull of the ship like the wings of a bird, sing a high-pitched and metallic song, the pleasant drone of which denies the deadly nature of the blurring blades."
