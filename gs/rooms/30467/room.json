      "Almost lulling in its rhythm, the sound of water lapping gently against the sides of anchored boats is constant.  Moonlight glistens upon the colorful variety of sails and painted decks as the fishermen rest and prepare for another day of work.  The flickering light of lanterns dots the area like twinkling fireflies, their brightness fading and resurfacing periodically in the misty fog that settles over the ocean's surface at night."
