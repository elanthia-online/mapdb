      "A small iron door nestles into an expansive white marble wall.  To the left of the door the wall is decorated with a large insignia, and to the right a silver plaque is firmly affixed.  Torches line the top of the wall to await nightfall.  The ground is firm yet icy, the dirt covered by a layer of snow compressed by the passage of many footsteps.  A few small pines struggle for existence in the frigid conditions.",
