      "Partition walls curve inward to form a short hallway leading deeper into the ger, their felt-wrapped frames marked with narrow bands of orange geometric patterning.  Beside this passage, a compact sitting space opens on a small area rug woven in muted orange and cream.  Plump round cushions rest around a low birch table, its smooth top supporting a short clay vase filled with mixed grassland blossoms."
