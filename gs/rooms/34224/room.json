      "Buffeted by wind born from a clash between heat washing up from below and the cold of the air so far beneath the surface, the overlook juts out over the strange geometries of the plaza below.  From the finger of craggy black stone, the crystal at the center of the aberrant construction is clearly visible, colossal in size though it is still half-buried in unyielding bedrock.  Pulses of energy flash within the pale depths, oddly hypnotic in their branching patterns."
