      "Towering overhead, a cylindrical mast stretches into the sky, a collared iron brace resting every ten feet up its length.  The full, white sails are stained from top to bottom and bleached white again.  On opposite sides of the deck, waist-high wooden railings prevent crew members from spilling overboard."
