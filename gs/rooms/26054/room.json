      "Small mountains of what can only be termed debris litter the surface of this barge, each collection more random than the last.  Multicolored bits of fabric are interspersed with bits and baubles of every imaginable shape and size.  At the center of the chaos, you can see a ramshackle shop, its somewhat symmetrical shape making it stand out against the chaos around it."
