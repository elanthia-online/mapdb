      "Despite the warm golden glow of sunlight that streams in through the ashlar-framed bow window the sitting room is chilly and the air is rank with the smell of stagnant water.  Once plush chairs, now shredded and devoid of their stuffing, stand skeletal around the room in a semicircle.  Using the wall as a support, a three-legged oak sideboard draped with a moldy covering teeters under a load of rotting food."
