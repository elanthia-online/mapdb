      "Several initiates from the abbey pass by a large hill of snow and ice on their way deeper into town.  A small path climbs toward a natural hollow at the top of the hill.  Lamp posts flank the cobblestone road, proceeding eastward, where excited shrieks and giggles ring out over the driven snows.",
      "Several people pass you by on their way about their business.  A large hill of snow and ice stands to the north, a small path running up it.  The most used way seems to be to the east, where you can hear excited shrieking and giggling."
