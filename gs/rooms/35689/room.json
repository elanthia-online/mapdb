      "A black and twisting wound in the surface of the dais has undermined its structural integrity, causing much of the northeastern quadrant to collapse.  Though still mostly of a piece, its angle is so skewed as to be untraversable.  Its farthest edges jut through the invisible wall binding the surrounding ocean.  Where the two meet, the disc shines with sickly green stormglow and the barrier shimmers with abyssal greens of answering brilliance in visible evidence of the magics holding back the waves."
