      "Sunlight glistens off the sandy dunes to the northwest where bright green and blue beach grasses sway and bend under the tug of a light breeze that carries the scent of salt and dog rose.  A single lantern marks the entry to a path that cuts through the maze of halfling-sized organic blades, while a pair of its brethren lines the cobblestone road where it bends north and east.  A pub fashioned of golden linden boards and large glaesine windows issues quiet music from its open doors.",
      "Moonlight glistens off the sandy dunes to the northwest where shadowy beach grasses sway and bend under the tug of a light breeze that carries the scent of salt and dog rose.  A single lantern marks the entry to a sandy path that cuts through the maze of dark organic blades, while a pair of its brethren lines the cobblestone road where it bends north and east.  Brightly lit, a pub fashioned of golden linden boards and large glaesine windows issues lively music from its open doors.",
