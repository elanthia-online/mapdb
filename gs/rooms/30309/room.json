      "Draping layers of tonal blue linen panels compose the airy canopy of the pavilion.  Copper lanterns are suspended from the tall crossbeams of the ceiling and over a large wooden table that hosts refreshments for guests.  A large fountain stands at the center, the burbling water serving to both cool and refresh the air."
