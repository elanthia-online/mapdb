      "Seemingly floating just above the water, this circular dais contains assorted altars positioned around a yellow barrier, each with an offering placed on top.  A profusion of massive stone platforms covered in ruins spread out above the inner lagoon, while the yellow barrier shimmers with light, providing a way back to the atoll.",
