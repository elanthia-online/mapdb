      "Achieving a trim, conservative air, the buildings in this area are all fronted with tiles in earthtones and pastels.  On the north side of the lane, a set of steps leads down to a modest tiled shop and its narrow entrance.  To the south, just beyond a high wall of white stone, a high-spired temple rises into the sky like a golden beacon.",
