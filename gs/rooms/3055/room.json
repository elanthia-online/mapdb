      "Workbenches and temporary shelters of pinewood dot the hardy red tundra grasses on the small thoroughfare, which passes beneath the high stone walls of Icemule Trace.  The fortifications span east and west for quite a distance in either direction.  At this close a proximity, the bustle of Icemule Trace's southern gate is a dull roar in the crisp, cold air.",
      "Poking through a layer of frost are patches of hardy tundra grass.  Rising stone walls span east and west for quite a distance in each direction.  The bustle of Icemule Trace's South Gate is quite audible at this close proximity."
