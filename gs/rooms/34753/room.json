      "Sandstone pillars stretching from floor to ceiling take the shapes of leaping cats, their agile forms carved in motion.  They support a multifaceted crystal dome that spills sunlight into the chamber.  The brilliant illumination cascades down the powerfully muscled back of a slumbering lion facing the entryway.  The beast looks as if it might rock with an intake of breath at any instant, but it is merely a statue, similar in make to the felines of ebony and bloodwood set into niches along the walls."
