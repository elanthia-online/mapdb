      "Rope-coiled rungs driven into the port and starboard sides near their convergence form a ladder of sorts, allowing quick travel between decks.  A bucket with a mop in it sits in a corner, ready for use on the scuffed pine floor.  Hanging next to a port side door is a large starfish, and nailed next to starboard side door is a lobster claw."
