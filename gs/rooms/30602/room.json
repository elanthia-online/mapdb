      "Ocean blue walls surround this small alcove off the central nexus to the northeast.  The focal point of the space is a swirling seafoam white portal framed by an oval of wrought silver.  Seashells of many varieties have been etched into the metal, each one overlapping another to form a pattern reminiscent of the scales of a fish.  A warm breeze swirls around the area, scented of the flora of Solhaven and the salty fragrance of the sea."
