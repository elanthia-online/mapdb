      "Elongated iron-caged braziers flank the periphery of the stone-edged waters, the drakar-piped wooden tub set below the glass-framed dome showcasing the auroral swirls in the eternal evening sky.  Scattered warg furs cover the planked floor leading towards the log-framed bed, the downy-stuffed mattress piled with thick woolen blankets.  A forest-carved ironwood table sits low at the foot of the bed, the ground beneath it graced by a diminutive version of the oversized bed."
