      "The hilltop, frequently blasted by cold winds and chill rain, is barren of all but the toughest shrubs.  A warren of canyons twists between the forlorn hills in every direction.  On the next hillock to the southeast, you spy a huge humanoid figure.  It slumps motionless, perhaps a fearsome giant contemplating the wastelands.",
