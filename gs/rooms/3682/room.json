      "A feeble ray of moonlight filters through the storm, lending the ice it touches an eerily beautiful radiance.  You pause to savor the sight, but all too quickly, the driving wind forces your eyes to close tightly against it.",
      "A small ray of sunlight filters through the storm, nearly blinding you as the light reflects off the ice and snow.  You shut your eyes tightly, and after what seems like forever the light fades, leaving you blinking to regain your vision."
