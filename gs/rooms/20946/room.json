    "description": [
      "A variety of roots and vines entangled around one another provide a solid grip for any missteps up and down the steeply rising ground, while also making way for the multitude of growth that springs up around the delicate cascade of water splashing its way down to a shallow pool much further below.  Further up the highland, trees converge on one another, alluding to a more dense coverage than the shallow veil of ferns that surrounds a series of wide and round rocks."
