      "A faint tropical scent fills the air around a glass display case.  Atop the case is a centerpiece comprised of hollow coconut shells stuffed with potpourri.  In one corner, a rope net hammock, filled with colorful silk pillows and strung from large hooks in the ceiling, hangs over a salt-stained trunk, its lid cracked and handles missing.  Some shoes and sandals, badly in need of repair, are piled next to a low dark steel workbench with a leather-covered stool positioned in front."
