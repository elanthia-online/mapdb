      "Towering poles line the muddy track, their tops housing colorful pennants and banners that snap and ripple in the arctic breeze.  Wrought iron baskets are set between each colorful display, each filled with thistle, thatch, and wood.  To the east and southeast, the round faces of tree stumps seem oddly bright in the sunlight.",

      "Wrought iron baskets set upon sturdy poles hold aloft burning thistle, thatch, and wood, the fiery mixture providing ample lighting along the muddy track.  Brisk arctic winds whip through the open glade to the east and southeast, setting the colorful pennants that line the track to snapping and causing the illuminating fires to gutter and hiss.  Silvery moonlight paints the faces of the fresh stumps that dot the landscape to create a sea of mini-moons in the snow and grass."
