      "Excavated from the ground is a massive pit with no visible side supports to prevent a cave-in.  The surface is nearly fifteen feet above the bottom, and the only exit is back up the ladder.  Considering the absense of display tables, inventory containers, or seating accommodations, the floating objects do little to unclutter the confined cavity."
