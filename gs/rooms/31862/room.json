      "Clusters of trees thin out as they approach the lake, leaving drifts of snow surrounding numerous icy buildings.  A cobblestone pathway wends east to west, and steep banks of snow block access to the glittering frozen lake.  Dozens of ice-melded penguins swarm across a giant mound of snow, many sporting unnatural, serrated beaks holding tiny bits of flesh."
