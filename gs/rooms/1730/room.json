    "description": [
      "A canyon's delta rises to either side.  The canyon narrows gradually to the southeast, rising slowly and disappearing into the towering mountain peaks.  The passage does not appear difficult.  To the north, a wide, flat valley spreads out for several miles before the mountains hem it in once again.  The valley has the appearance of a bowl that has been filled in with centuries of ice, for its surface is level and smooth with only the occasional rock protruding through the snow."
