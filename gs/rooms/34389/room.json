      "Some faintly glowing lanterns reflect off the polished curved mahogany walls, creating a warm glow that illuminates the dark room.  A wooden sign with \"Ice Hound Pub\" burnt into the wood hangs above a blackened stone fireplace.  Cushioned booths with small tables line the curved walls of the pub.  A large polished cherrywood bar sits in the middle of the room.  Glass shelves behind the bar hold familiar and exotic alcoholic offerings.  Several doors lead in and out of the pub."
