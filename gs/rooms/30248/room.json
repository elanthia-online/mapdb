    "description": [
      "A glaes-accented oak docking structure rises from the water with five piers jutting out in orderly fashion to provide numerous points of portage.  Every docking slip sports thick, canvas-wrapped cork bumpers and a dozen buoys painted with golden helms.  An oak sign strung between thick strands of hemp railing reads, \"West Docks, Dreamstone Pier - Slips 6-10.\"  A severed kiramon mandible is haphazardly nailed to the bottom of the sign."
