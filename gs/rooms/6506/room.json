    "description": [
      "On this windswept ridge, patches of sky can be seen through the canopy of trees.  Wispy tamaracks stretch their long branches across the trail, their pale green needles giving off a pleasant perfume.  Winterberry and sheep laurel take advantage of the more ambient light here, and creeping wood sorrel cloaks the ground.  To the south, the road descends toward the sound of water.  Northwest, it meanders into denser woods."
