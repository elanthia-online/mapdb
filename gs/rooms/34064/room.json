      "The hallway comes to the end in a curved niche featuring a sprawling mural, the naturally rich colors of the pigments augmented by gemstone dust and gilt.  Within the image, a majestic woman with troubled features and golden eyes holds a pair of tablets aloft, one dark and one light.  Nacreous bands of metal cavort across the walls and frame the murals, seeming to glow faintly with their own inner light."
