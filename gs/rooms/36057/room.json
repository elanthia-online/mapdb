    "description": [
      "Riverstones in shades of grey, cream, and muted rose blanket the shoreline of Khesta 'Dahl, their rounded shapes glimmering as the water laps over them.  Tufts of lake sedge and cattails that cluster near the shallows, their narrow blades rising in loose fans where the ground dips toward the waves.  To the east, the dark forest presses close to the waterline, while a small hillock that rises to the south is traversable by a set of alternating larch and birch steps.  Mist from the lake drifts inland in thin, cooling sheets."
