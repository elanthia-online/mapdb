    "description": [
      "Silvery starlight filters through the leafy boughs above, casting long, dappled bands of light across a platform nestled high in the kermes oak.  Wooden planks, bound tightly by rope in intricate, decorative knots, form the sturdy floor, their grain weathered but smooth.  Cushions in muted tones are scattered across the space, offering small comforts amid the rustling leaves.  Beyond the edge of the platform, the small harbor town sprawls below, its rooftops glinting faintly in the moonlit view."
