      "This heavily wooded valley sits like a natural bowl nestled between several high rugged hills.  Thick grasses grow on those patches of ground where the sun is able to penetrate the dense canopy of leaves overhead.  The air is still, quiet and surprisingly warm, even in the deep shade.  To the northeast can be heard the sound of falling water.",

Thick grasses grow on those patches of ground where the sun is able to penetrate the dense canopy of leaves overhead during the daylight hours.  The air is still, quiet and surprisingly warm, even though the sun has set.  To the northeast can be heard the sound of falling water."
