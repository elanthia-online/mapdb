      "Flame-licked window slits have been set evenly along the tower walls, leaving black tendrils across the room and towards the open roof.  Broken glass and steel lay scattered across the floor, the large pieces casting odd shadows upon the walls.  Faint scratching sounds echo off the heavy stones, the louder noises muffled by the piles of straw scattered below the windows."
