      "Tangled together, wild blueberry bushes fill the spaces between each of the towering pine trees at the edge of a deciduous forest that marches down the eastern slope.  Marsh grasses and cattails sway in the breeze that slips through the air, their ends rustling or clacking together discordantly.  Several boulders ring the edge of a large pond whose waters ripple gently as a stream in the south feeds into it."
