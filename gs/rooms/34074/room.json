      "Several chairs upholstered in shades of blue and stitched with prancing penguins sit toward the western end of the pavilion in an intimate circle.  Behind them, a blizzard granite brazier cradles a small but merry fire that warms the surroundings and makes the chairs' shadows dance.  A wolf fur rug is laid out in the center of the circle."
