      "The ground is layered with fallen leaves and debris until the rugged surface curves abruptly to walls that frame the sky overhead.  The walls are rough with crevices and riddled with tiny holes like the inside of any hollow tree, though this one seems to be missing its top and is far larger than most ever reach.  A crevice on the north wall is deeper than the others with light visible beyond."
