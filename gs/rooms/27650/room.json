      "The solid walls of this room are barely visible through a fog that circulates about, yet brief glimpses reveal various sigils covering the walls, varied in color, shape, and vibrancy.  The haze is in constant in motion, forming tendrils which weave in and out of your presence.  An ironwood table and a glowbark display case are neatly centered in the middle of the room, causing any fog near them to dissipate.",
