      "Carved into the stone wall, an illuminated tunnel leaves the bustling shadow of the market behind as it heads in a slow decline through the towering cliff.  Pinpoints of light within the tunnel mark lanterns, while a subtle breeze cooled by the dark stone carries with it the stunningly sweet scent of scarlet milkweed."
