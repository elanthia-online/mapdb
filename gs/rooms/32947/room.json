      "A sizeable wooden wheel is displayed against the wall of the office, the helm's surface carved in elaborate nautical imagery and coated in dark lacquer.  Several gold-framed maps line the planked walls, each one depicting various trade routes through the surrounding waters of the Great Western Sea and beyond.  A worn leather-backed chair sits behind a kraken-carved desk of driftwood, the surface cluttered with various bottles glinting as the moonlight peeks through the tall windows."
