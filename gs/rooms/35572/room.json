      "Bone-white sand thins as the cavern narrows, giving way to smooth stone and mica-threaded coral.  Bioluminescent tube anemones drift overhead, their soft light pulsing against the curved walls.  Three narrow branches split off the eastern side, each framed by coral lips.  A shallow nook is carved into the western wall, where a treasure trove of shells and glinting stones rests.  Nearby, a polished nacre mirror hangs askew above a barnacle-clustered shell-shaped sign etched with curling script."
