      "The simple design and ramshackle look of wooden boarding houses along the road suggest that the occupants belong to the burrow's working class.  A number of the buildings have oiled parchment tacked over their windows to block out intrusive light.  Two young halfling girls sit on the front steps of one of the houses.",
      "From the simple design and sheer number of closely set wooden houses, it appears that this is a residential area for the neighborhood's working class.  A number of houses have oiled parchment tacked over their windows, as though to block any external light from disturbing the inhabitants.  A dim lantern hanging from one of the houses illuminates its front steps and casts a pale pool of light into the street.",
