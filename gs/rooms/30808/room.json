      "Steel-banded oak barrels are stacked one on top of the other and made fast against the bulkhead.  Bags labeled coffee, tea, and flour are secured in place with web-like ropes, one of the bags torn open at one corner and spilling its fragrant black leaves to the salt-encrusted planks underfoot.  A large driftwood chest is thrown open, the sunlight glinting off a handful of gold coins inside."
