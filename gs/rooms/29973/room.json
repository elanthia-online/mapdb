      "Beneath a low ceiling of hewn stone, the corridor proceeds southward past the empty eyes of crumbling stone statues of men and women in primitive armor.  One statue is missing half of its head.  The sundered portion lies in the shadowed crevice between the effigy's booted feet, its single eye open as if in fascination or horror."
