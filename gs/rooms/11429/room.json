      "Overstuffed armchairs, upholstered in comfortable rolton cotton dyed in muted oranges and browns, are arranged in small groups around the room.  A large fireplace warms the air around you with its lively blaze.  A picture window allows an unobstructed view of the river below and the delta in the distance.  An arched doorway leads out to the veranda.  The silky, slow, susurrations of river water passing over rocks lend an atmosphere of peace to the room."
