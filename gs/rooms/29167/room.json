      "This side of the ledge along the basalt cliff face allows a view above the waterfalls feeding the river Muagh.  The river splits the town of Kharam Dzu below.  Wedged between two basalt columns is an abandoned nest.  Progress upwards is impossible and there is no safe way down.  Little else is here."
