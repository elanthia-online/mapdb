      "Several tented and rusted cauldrons are placed about the small room to collect the steadily dripping water that seeps through the sodden roof.  Tiny rivulets cascade down the northern wall, their passage causing the paint to blister and peel.  A small round table sits in the only dry section of both floor and ceiling, its contents illuminated by a flickering candle."
