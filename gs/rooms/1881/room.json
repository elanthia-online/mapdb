      "Darkness seems to be the theme for this room as it has no lighting save for what washes in from the entrance.  Before you is a short wooden counter with an odd-looking tree of keys resting on it.  You notice a small note just under the tree.  Behind the counter, a slit-eyed halfling watches you with a practice-wary gaze.",
