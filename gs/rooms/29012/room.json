    "description": [
      "The shallow entryway unfolds into a plush sitting area that seems more elegant state room than pub.  Floors and walls of varnished mahogany gleam darkly beneath the flickering candles set within a pair of lofty chandeliers, and the air is filled with the scent of high-priced cigars and vintage spirits.  A sepia-toned globe guards a set of upward steps at the far end of the bar, and across the way, a curved brass handrail follows a stairway upward into the darkness."
