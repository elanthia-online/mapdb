      "Canting to one side, a nondescript wooden shop is huddled amongst the backs of buildings at the western edge of a wide, cobblestoned thoroughfare while opposite green-grey ocotillo rise like dead sticks from the runnels near Old Ward Wall, their thin forms pale green and riddled with thorns.  The lights of Comyner's Market spill across the street, illuminating the dark section of road."
