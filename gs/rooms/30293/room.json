      "Swelling sands climb to a serpentine ridgeline that curves behind the sprawl of tents, stalls, and pavilions embracing the glistening oasis.  Looped around scattered palms, a twisted yucca rope pens off camels in a temporary pasture of white bursage shrubs and budding creosote bushes.  Loose grit sweeps across the arcing desert path, tumbling under the gentle persuasion of the wind."
