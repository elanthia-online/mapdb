      "Like a small ceramic closet, the balnea is elegantly decorated with a tiled mosaic floor and walls.  Soothing fragrances waft from the golden brazier that sits atop a tripod in one corner.  The heat and scents relaxes you, inviting you to lie on the benches and let the warmth work out the aches and pains of the day."
