      "Crammed into the tight space are several stacks of crates with ledgers spread out atop them.  A lantern hangs off the back of the door held by a simple steel hook.  Tucked between two crates is a wastebin holding some balled-up papers and a charred ledger with a giant letter \"C\" still visible on the spine."
