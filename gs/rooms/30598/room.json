      "Pale pink walls surround this small alcove off the central nexus to the southwest.  The focal point of the space is a swirling iridescent portal framed by an oval of wrought silver.  Sprawling cherry blossom branches have been etched into the metal, their flowering lengths mingling near the top, reminiscent of a garden bower.  A mild breeze swirls around the area, scented of the flora of Ta'Illistim."
