      "The thin red carpet that covers the floor is worn in a line from the north to some teller windows, head high to a dwarf, in the southern wall.  Apart from a sign that has been hung on the wall over the windows, the only other decoration in the room is a small framed painting hung on the west wall.  Otherwise, this plain room offers no other portals or exits."
