      "Propped in one corner is a large black anchor with a section of thick chain wound on the floor around it.  Across from the anchor is a wide bed with a blue coverlet over it.  The blue curtains framing the open window have anchors embroidered along the edge.  On the west wall is a large painting of a ship in a tropical lagoon."
