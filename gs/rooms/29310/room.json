      "A sturdy cedar door anchors the bare, unpainted floor of smooth rock, which supports a large workbench bookended by heavy chests of tools and precious metals.  Various taxidermied birds of prey hang overhead from steel wire, while murals of woodland creatures, furry and scaly alike, wrap around the walls."
