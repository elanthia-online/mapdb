      "Eastern stretches of the path run beside an expanse of lady ferns, their fronds feathered and dense, crowding together in layered waves of green, plum, and bronze.  Across the track, autumn-hued leaves mingle with fallen evergreen needles, mottling the ground in a patchwork of color.  Towering trunks rise overhead, their lower branches stripped bare, reaching upward like arms lifted in supplication, while beyond them, faint glimpses of twilight hues filter through the canopy's dark weave."
