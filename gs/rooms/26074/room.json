      "Four dogwood trees are carved into each of the chamber's walls, their four-petaled blossoms hollowed out to create petite shelves that house hundreds of tiny candles.  Tiled murals stand beneath the flower-laden boughs of the blooming beauties that occupy the eastern and western walls, while to the north, a set of stairs leads upward and to the south, another set leads down."
