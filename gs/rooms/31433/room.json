      "The lack of natural light and an abundance of moisture has fostered an unexpected home for maidenhair ferns and elderberry bushes.  Dirt and debris, transported from a steady trickle of water from the upper floor, has settled along the moss-covered ground and provides ample nutrients for the botanic migrants to thrive.  Wrapped in petrified roots, a partially buried chest rests in the corner, taunting all who enter."
