      "A short hallway stretches from an arch at either end.  Its roof is peaked, created by a juncture of buttress roots.  The floor is finished with flagstones, the grouting between tinted a bright shade of green from moss growing there.  Along each side, the growing wood of the tree parts in places, providing views of the foliage outside, and birds have built nests here and there in handy crevices of the window openings."
