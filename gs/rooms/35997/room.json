      "Suffused light emanates from a black marble fireplace set against the far wall, supplementing the light streaming through small shuttered windows.  A natural, unobstructed walkway across the white marble floor is created from the curtain to the fireplace by the placement of a deep-seated leather couch and an opposing sturdy table with an assortment of papers scattered upon it.  A glass-fronted display case is set against the wall next to a wall-mounted blackboard and an iron-worked framed picture hangs above depicting beautiful Aelotoi figures, with wings unfurled."
