      "Covered with slick, green moss, many of the grey floor planks in this section of the walkway are warped, the footing treacherous.  Empty earthenware flower pots are pushed up against the black iron balustrade, one post tied with once colorful ribbons that are now faded and fraying.  The view below is of a maze of gardens behind the hotel."
