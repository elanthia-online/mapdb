      "Latticed branches of ebony are crafted to form a natural canopy across the cobblestone-paved road, providing shade for a scattering of wrought faenor benches set along the perimeter.  Interspersed between the seats are diminutive planters of vert-colored clay, the vessels resting upon circular tables covered in embroidered linen.  A tall row of faenor lamp posts stand guard across the opposite side of the walkway, their spherical nielira-etched lanterns loosely entangled in heartleaf."
