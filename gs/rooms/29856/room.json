      "This rickety little shack seems to serve as a dagger museum of sorts.  Small blades of all shapes and provenances sit on display in time-worn glass cases hanging from the shack's walls, while other weapons are available for sale atop a crescent leather-topped table.  Above a rough log pedestal, a notice is stuck to the shack's walls by a rusted knife."
