      "Primitive hieroglyphs form uneven lines on the walls, clustered heavily around the niches to either side of the walkway.  An old corpse has partially toppled from its resting place, leaving its sunken eye sockets to stare blankly down the corridor as it approaches a bend to the west.  Tantalizing flickers of light from that direction reflect in watery ripples off of the puddles on the uneven floor."
