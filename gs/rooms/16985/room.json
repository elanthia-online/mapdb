      "The shade from the Guild Hall, northern wall and hedge to the south makes this ring an ideal place to be physically active.  Only during the high noon hours does the ring become entirely saturated in sunlight.  The canvas floor is a bit battle-worn, with old bloodstains splotched here and there."
