      "Tall reeds and river grasses lean over and crowd the path as it winds its away through the diminishing space between the wooden structure and the underside of the bridge.  A large opening, a darkness framed by reeds, beckons right at the point where passage any further would result in collision with the drawbridge's underbelly.  At the beginning of the path, next to the wood structure, the earth has been beaten into a hard surface."
