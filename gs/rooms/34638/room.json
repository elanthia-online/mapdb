    "description": [
      "The walls encircling the base of the Bastion are high and strong, formed from great blocks of basalt that are fitted together so closely that the seams between stones are difficult to detect.  They are dwarfed by the great spire itself, a looming black talon that scrapes at the sky.  Neither businesses nor homes trespass onto the side of the curving street occupied by the fortifications, but flowers and grasses flourish in the greenways beneath the walls."
