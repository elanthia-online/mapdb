      "Hand drawn, ink-splotched star charts line the walls, and a large, thick area rug covers the floor, deafening footsteps.  Prominently placed against one wall is a finely crafted, solid oak writing desk, complete with blank parchment and all manner of writing accessories.  A variety of mismatched antiquated stools, chairs, and benches have been arranged to provide seating for visitors."
