      "Shrouded in night's shadows, a bamboo cottage and its surrounding palm trees allude to a haven of safe comfort.  A narrow path of crushed shells, its pale hue standing out in the midst of the darker soil it passes through, leads from a wooden gate to the cottage.  Dimly lit by a single lantern, a porch-like area houses several tall posts and a wicker chair.  The lantern's flame casts splinters of illumination into the dark, at odds with the scent of orchids hangs heavily in the humid air.",
      "As if growing up out of the tropical environs, a simple bamboo cottage is crafted from natural woods and surrounded by tall, arching palm trees.  A narrow path of crushed shells, its route passing through rich, dark soil planted with bumbleebee orchids, bird's nest ferns, birds-of-paradise, tall white lillies, and colorful dahlias, leads from a wooden gate to the cottage.  Below the leaning palms, a porch-like area boasts fishing nets that hang from several tall posts and a wicker chair that faces the street."
