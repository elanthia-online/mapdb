      "Polished oak paneling skirts the lodge, contrasting with green trim and upholstery on the generous leather armchairs.  A large trestle table occupies one of the room's ends, flanked by a number of carved oak chairs.  In the shadow of an overstuffed green sofa is a narrow slatted stairway, which leads upward to an open loft.  A stone hearth dominates all, occupying the long wall across from a painted green door.  Above the hearth, an immense elk trophy surveys its domain with a solemn gaze."
