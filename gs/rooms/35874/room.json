      "Large, artfully carved blocks of mistwood are pushed against the walls, serving as makeshift tables amid a sea of casks used as seating throughout the hall.  The raucous clinking of mugs and boisterous storytelling does little to drown out the constant drone of the mill's waterwheel.  An old long-bearded dwarf stands amid a circular mistwood bar in the middle of it all, shifting his attention between a ruddy clay stove and a wooden rack full of glass bottles."
