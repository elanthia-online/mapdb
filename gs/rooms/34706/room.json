      "A splendid mosaic of jewelled tesserae dominates the western wall of the colosseum, depicting a massively muscled figure battling with a silver-scaled wyrm with scintillating wings.  The titanic clash makes the comparatively mundane activities beneath it seem mildly incongruous.  A red-inked ledger sits atop a curved blackwood desk at the base of the sprawling artwork."
