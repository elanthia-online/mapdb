      "The darkness parts, allowing the achromatic sky to peek out, casting some brightness over the lowlands.  In the distance, the sound of grinding rock against stone signals the earth continues to be at war with itself.  To the north and northwest of here lies the battered and abandoned remains of a once magnificent castle."
