      "Rattan baskets filled with colorful blooms hang from the bronze frame of the large glasshouse.  Large panes of glaesineth create the ceiling, door, and walls of the structure, allowing warm sunlight to shine through the abundant greenery.  Raised beds, overflowing with a wide variety of flowering plants, line pebble walkways that wind throughout the building around a central counter strewn with various gardening tools.  Potted rose bushes are scattered about, adding to the kaleidoscope of color."
