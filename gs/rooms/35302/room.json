      "Crowned in a small dome, the lobby is a nexus for multiple banks and collection offices.  A central archway heads eastward towards the central entry, while the northern and southern walls are a hive of arches.  Pendant lanterns issue a steady white glow, keeping the space free of shadows and brightly illuminated.  Cushioned in velveteen, a series of seats encircle a potted and groomed juniper."
