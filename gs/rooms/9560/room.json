      "Brilliant white marble comprises the structure of this chamber, with runes inscribed along the seams.  A single, glowing crystal has been imbedded in the domed ceiling just above a burnished mithril table at the heart of the workshop.  Housed within a series of shallow ledges that have been carved into the wall are a wide variety of potions, alembics, and phials."
