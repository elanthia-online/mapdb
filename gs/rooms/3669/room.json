      "A pair of tall, beribboned stone columns flanks the entrance to the Four Winds National Bank.  The three-story building dwarfs the surrounding shops and remains the largest in the city proper.  Tiled in a rustic red shingle, the roof of the bank appears to be a cool silvery purple hue as the moonlight reflects off its surface.  A pair of armor-clad elven warriors guard the entrance, their gaze never wavering as they protect the city's treasure.",
