      "Dark sapphire motes add color to the thick ivory wool carpet that cushions the floor.  To one side of the entrance is a small white oak table that holds a variety of refreshments.  A woven basket of sticks rests next to an ornate copper brazier placed centrally in the room.  A large sofa padded with dark blue cushions and a pair of chairs are placed in a circular pattern about the room.  Standing next to an etched vaalin-framed mirror is a dressing room door."
