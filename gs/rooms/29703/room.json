      "Thickly woven wool blankets form the walls of the geteld, the bright blue cloth interlaced with overlapping red and yellow chevrons.  Grass green globes dangle from the fabric-covered ridge pole, providing a subtle, but ample light, for a lively and well-illuminated atmosphere.  A long display table stretches between ash support rails along the front and in clear view of the entry, while a large grind wheel occupies much of the space behind."
