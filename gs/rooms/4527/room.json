      "The grey-hued limestone floor of the cave has been worn to an almost slippery smoothness and a dull reflection.  On the concave stone walls there is not much to be admired in the way of decorative efforts.  Instead, an odd pile of leather and metal pieces is somewhat reminiscent of a broken statuary."
