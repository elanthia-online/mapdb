      "Water seeps from sandstone block walls creating murky pools on a packed dirt floor, while a variety of basins and tubs collect water dripping from the high ceiling.  Draped from a thick beam overhead, a canvas tarpaulin shields a grey driftwood cabinet, keeping the linens within dry.  A clothesline is strung from an aged oak mantel, a pair of socks dangling just beyond the reach of the flames from a modest fire."
