      "Connecting seamlessly to the space below via a smooth staircase, the room is framed by white plaster walls.  Turquoise shutters frame the windows, letting in natural light and adding a vibrant touch to the space.  Near the double doors of teal shutters, which open onto a rooftop veranda, a pair of backless curule chairs has been set.  A bespeckled half-elf agent stands nearby, quietly reading.  Overhead, an intricately carved ceiling beam runs the length of the room, adorned with motifs of tamarisk leaves and blossoms painted in soft green and pink."
