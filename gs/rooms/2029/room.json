      "Within the lee of a large dune stands a stone statue held in the sand's embrace.  The stone is pocked and encrusted with old barnacles and blemishes, and it is carved in the primitive shape of a torso and head.  It faces out to sea, its wide staring eyes endlessly searching the far horizon.  The sand encases the artifact around its shoulders, concealing how much, or little, of the figure lies beneath the surface of the beach."
