      "The road bends slightly here without much fanfaire as it winds along its course between the two great cities.  The cobblestones, each looking like the last, provide for an easy passage for travellers to continue on their way.",
      "A small number of birds fly about overhead as you top a small hill where the cobblestone road bends slightly.  The birds seem to be engaging in some sort of dizzying dance in the air as they swoop amongst themselves in ever tightening circles."
