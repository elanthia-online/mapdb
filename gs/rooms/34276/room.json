      "Shadows from the flickering lantern's cut-outs in the adjacent lounge flit aimlessly through this modest room of knowledge, creating illusions of flying insects among the plethora of parchments, journals, and books lining the enclosing shelves.  Situated between two reading tables is an elaborately carved cabinet with depictions of prominent historians chiseled onto its surface.  Large bundles of aged papyrus secured with twine rest in the corner, but the ink appears to have faded from most of the pages."
