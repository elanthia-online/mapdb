      "Despite being made of interlinked bones, this crypt seems fairly sturdy.  Flickering blue flame illuminates the space from lit candles sitting inside several of the skulls set into the crooked walls, the eerie light making it seem like the skull's eyes are glowing.  The floor, unlike the rest of the structure, is made of packed dirt."
