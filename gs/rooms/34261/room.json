    "description": [
      "Beneath the arc of the stone bridge, the cavern floor gives way to a gash in the earth so deep that light cannot reach its utmost verges.  Steaming water from a bordering hot spring pours over the edge in a colorful waterfall that smells of rotten eggs.  Breaching through one wall of the canyon is an expanse of white crystal the same hue as the tremendous jewel at the cavern's center, though it is impossible to discern whether or not it is of a single piece with the great gem."
