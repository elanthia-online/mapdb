      "The trees here are older than elsewhere in the grove, their trunks wide and knotted.  A layer of pine needles lays atop the path, muffling footfalls from the shoppers making their way to and from the various stalls and booths.  A great tortoise sits motionless to one side of the trail, slumbering peacefully."
