      "Time has caused the wooden planks that form the walls to draw away from one another, letting in the smells and sounds of the river, along with several of its small, winged denizens.  A rocking chair and a braided rug give the room a homey feel, though the tall cabinets indicate more professional activities.  Several bundles of wildflowers hang upside-down from the rafters, perfuming the air as they dry and fade."
