      "The grasses grow singularly tall on this part of the headlands, creating a sort of golden screen that nearly conceals a house-sized boulder that emerges from an earthen mound.  The southward path slopes down to a series of low seaside bluffs.  The waves on the beach below are an eerie green in the moonlight.",

The southward path slopes down to a series of low seaside bluffs.  On the dark beach below sandpipers dart back and forth, dodging the incoming waves as they feed."
