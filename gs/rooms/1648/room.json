      "This small copse of yew trees is completely encircled by the tall tanik forest.  The swiftly-flowing creek is quite narrow here, rushing loudly among the stones.  A series of flat riverstones seem to have been deliberately placed in the creek to offer a way for the nimble adventurer to cross."
