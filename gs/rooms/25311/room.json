      "[A Mosquito Net Tent]"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Supported by a single pole, the tent is comprised largely of drab olive mosquito netting and is vaguely transparent.  A crude oil lamp fashioned of brass is hung from the central post, while several chests lie at the tent's four corners and pin the netting into place.  Cooking equipment spills out of an oilcloth camping pack near the rear of the tent where an oilcloth and fleece sleeping bag is laid out."
