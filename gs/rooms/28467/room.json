      "Creamy white walls are inset along the borders with colorful gem shards, creating a clean, but soft, atmosphere.  Framed by lace curtains, several windows allow sunlight to pour in and glint off of several of the many decorative masks that hang from the ceiling.  Across from an armoire, a crystal case is crowded with items on display, and a gold-painted arch leads further into the wagon.",

Framed by lace curtains, several windows allow moonlight to pour in, and a broad collection of flame-lit candles sitting in silver sconces illuminates various decorative masks that hang from the ceiling.
