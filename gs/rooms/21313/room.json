      "The walls of this room are almost obscured by trophies of the hunt.  Hides and heads of a score or more assorted beasts of the wild places are mounted to the wall or hung from the rafters.  A plain wooden bed rests between two windows roughly curtained with tanned skins.  The well-stuffed chair sitting before the stone fireplace completes the feeling of rough-hewn comfort."
