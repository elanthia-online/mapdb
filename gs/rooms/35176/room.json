      "Tattered flags of oilcloth and wool hang above the crossbeams of the expansive shop, the insignia-stitched banners brushing against the dust-covered glass display at the center of the warped floorboards.  Arranged along the periphery are aged suits of steel armor, each plated hand gripping a sword or lance held aloft in a veil of brittle cobwebs.  A series of chain-bound shelves line the walls leading to additional rooms, the wares displayed in carved wooden boxes and bowls stained in ichor."
