      "The faint glow of dozens of silk-strung faerthiel illuminates the frame-covered walls of the boutique, the tiny baubles radiating outwards from a tall mirror set above the marble counter.  Glazed glass vases are interspersed between silk-draped mannequins caught in various balletic poses, their arms raised towards the staircase leading upwards towards the melodic sounds of instruments echoing across the steps.  A rose-carved cabinet stands against the far wall, stacked with rolls of rich fabric."
