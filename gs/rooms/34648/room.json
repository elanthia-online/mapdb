      "The savory aroma of roasting meat beckons on the breeze, tantalizing and teasing from the lofty, arched windows of a thriving restaurant at the end of the row.  Along the flagstone patio, fine metal chains hold aloft a series of glass lanterns.  Though unlit, they refract the sunlight in dazzling rainbowed patterns over the outdoor seats and tables.  Atop the steepled roof, silk pennants in amber and dusky gold flutter proudly, their fabric embroidered with stylized lions."
