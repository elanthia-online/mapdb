    "description": [
      "The lack of vegetation and the dust on the trail conspire to create a dry, thirsty journey.  A gentle, warm wind blows through the area, just enough to raise the small amount of dust and swirl it around and away.  A hundred yards or so from the cliff, a dark creature glides in lazy circles, perhaps searching for a meal in the hills below.  Every so often it banks closer, as if keeping a wary eye on your movements, then soars away again to resume its slow circling.",
      "The lack of vegetation and the heat from the cliff side conspire to create a dry, thirsty journey.  A gentle, warm wind blows through the area, just enough to raise the small amount of dust on the switchback and swirl it around and away.  A hundred yards or so from the cliff, an eagle glides on the warm updraft, perhaps searching for a meal in the hills below.  Every so often it banks closer, keeping a wary eye on your movements, then soars away again to resume its slow circling."
