      "Falling from the peaked ceiling in tailored pleats, the mustard yellow silk forms smooth walls and pools elegantly on forest green rugs.  Frosted glass lanterns dangle from eahnor chains over a glass counter, providing excellent illumination by which to view the wares, while a pendant lantern hangs over a polished red oak table."
