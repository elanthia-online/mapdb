      "Supply-filled niches are carved into the stone of the open landscape, leaving additional well-stocked racks and crates resting in the tall grass nearby.  A wood-planked trough has been wrought into the shape of a large ship, set upon kraken-forged iron legs extending towards the iron gate leading back to the din of the town.  Ragged parchment maps cover the fence posts studding an iron-bound entry leading back inside, covered with various scribbles and partially obscuring several leaflets from distant lands."
