      "Inside the hive you see thick, overlapping layers of honeycomb laden with nectar and encapsulated with beeswax.  The thick amber liquid produced by the inhabitants here oozes and drips slowly around a dark crack, towards a shallow hole where a large knot has fallen free from the adjoining bough.  Thousands upon thousands of worker drones buzz around you, seemingly docile and undisturbed by your presence."
