      "The trail continues to move in a northeast/southwest direction through the monotonous sea of grass.  The wind barely stirs the tops of the blades, and, except for the infrequent flight of some small animal frightened by the footsteps, the view is a serene, untroubled landscape.  A few small clouds drift lazily overhead to block the moon at times, and pockets of mist swirl near some of the larger boulders, the edges of the mists coalescing and breaking apart as the breezes buffets them.",
