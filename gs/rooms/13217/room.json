    "description": [
      "Walls of dark granite paneled in light ash encase this simple yet austere chamber.  A large tapestry depicting a berry-laden bush hangs along one wall, opposite the gently undulating flames in a stone hearth.  The musky scent of burning wood clings to the air in the room, mixing with the sweet scent of freshly crushed berries rising from a bowl atop a small table.  An elegant bed of highly polished wood lies near the center of the room, its light green linen snugly tucked."
