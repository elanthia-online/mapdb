    "description": [
      "Without an abundance of light, the ability to identify distant objects is difficult at best.  The location of this bridge, however, is situated directly beneath a thin stream of light, infiltrating the cavern from an aperture farther up the wall.  Prowling and lurking far below are packs of hounds, some with eyes that cast a green glow, and others whose nostrils erupt a green mist.  Patches of tinged fog rise slowly into the air, but dissipate long before they reach the bridge."
