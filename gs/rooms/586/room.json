      "A grotto harbors a junction of paths crisscrossing its mossy green sward with fingers leading away in three directions.  In the clearing's center stands a stela, tall and thin, its northern face covered with moss.  A fine tracery of carving is barely visible on its other sides, the complex designs weathered to near obscurity by time."
