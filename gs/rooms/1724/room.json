    "description": [
      "A pass opens up to the northwest between two of the DragonSpine's loftier peaks while a narrow trail winds along the mountainside to the south.  There might be a spectacular view to the east, if it weren't for the clouds.  Instead the view is one of a fluffy, swirling, pillow-like surface of white stretching away into the distance.  Occasionally the clouds part briefly to give a glimpse of thick forest and rugged terrain below."
