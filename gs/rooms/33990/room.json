      "Silver and iron twist artistically between panes of glaesineth, enclosing the entire alcove in glass.  Starlight sparkles through the green-tinged panes, casting eerie shadows across the roses and violets hand-painted along the intricate parquetry floor.  Several candelabra are positioned about the outer walls, the light from their ghost white and blood red tapers casting dim illumination throughout the area."
