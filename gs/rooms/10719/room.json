      "Dark green grass fills the area, interrupted frequently by bones half buried in the ground.  A jaw bone rests against a rock, along with other bones from a skeleton.  A skull from some sort of feline lies deep in a clump of tall grass.  Moonlight glints off the moisture that coats the grass.",
