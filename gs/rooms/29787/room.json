      "Smooth slate tiles, cut into perfect hexagons, line the floor in a honeycomb pattern.  The floor is largely devoid of detritus and marks, save for a slight depression in front of a smooth driftwood workbench.  Through rune-etched glass, a large arched window provides a view of the sun sparkling on the ocean waves."
