      "Filtering through the skylight above, beams of pale moonlight fill the small area.  A silk-lined oak shelf hangs above a long wooden table whose top is covered with bits of feathers, ribbons, charms, and wire.  Strands of ivy hang down the far wall from a narrow planter that runs the length of the room."
