      "A series of ship-carved wooden shelves frame the elongated haon counter set before the grey stucco back wall, a pink-haired elven clerk arranging a number of weathered ledgers beside her between sips from a glass teacup.  A brass-framed lantern of jade green glass sits beside the clerk, etched with a bloom of nielira between the bubbled surface, their tentacles dancing in the ambient flames.  The soft sound of feline snoring echoes from beneath the counter, the snuffling interrupted by the occasional purr."
