      "Behind the small wedding chapel off to the southeast sits two parallel rows of stables.  Wooden walls have been pristinely whitewashed and the thatched roofs are expertly maintained.  One of the west side azure-shuttered doors has been left open, and a soft whinny can be heard coming from within.",

One of the west side azure-shuttered doors has been left open and the smell of fresh manure wafts on the breeze."
