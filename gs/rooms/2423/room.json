      "Peddlers from out of Briarmoon Cove and Pinefar wander up and down the road, loudly touting their wares.  A general store sits to the side of the road, decorated with banners in a cheerful rainbow of colors.  The customers are an eclectic mix of fledgling adventurers and townsfolk, the two groups united in their need for various odds and ends.",
      "Halfling merchants wander up and down the road here, hawking their wares.  A low wooden building sits to the side of the road, decorated with banners in a rainbow of colors, each declaring it a general store.  From inside, the hustle and bustle of feet can be heard, punctuated by an occasional shout as items are bought and sold."
