      "A small ledge provides an icy stage from which to view the vast panorama of storm-swept tundra.  Here and there, smudges show the location of roving bears and mammoths, which are soon swallowed up in the shifting storm fronts.  The snowy shelf is backed by a sloping formation which appears to be solid ice, with a jagged crevice along one side.  A path leads to the northeast, where a trail is visible through the flurries."
