      "The lane ends in a circular court, ringed by stately houses.  None of the street venders crowded into the busy avenues of Khan'Kel have penetrated into this plaza.  On the court's far side, one of the buildings houses a school, as advertised by the banner hanging outside its door sporting a spell-book, a candle and a wand.  The homes crowding close on all other sides have a graceful elegance and manicured shrubbery in pots outside many of the doors."
