      "The outline of a crown in steel and gilt has been inlaid into the marble of the far wall, where it glints menacingly in the radiance pouring through the stained glass ceiling.  Torrents of flame blaze from three great stone hearths set into the walls, their infernal breath filling the air with oppressive, stinging heat.  Atop an altar of grey steel etched with golden tongues of fire, a charcoal grey prayerbook lies open, its pages edged in brilliant gilt."
