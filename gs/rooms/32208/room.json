      "Ragged glass shards trim the expansive window that affords an open, uninterrupted view of the street.  A cool breeze blows through the suspiciously lifelike bats dangling from the rafters, causing them to pendulate over the wrought iron tables and matching chairs.  Nearly cocooned in cobwebs, a copper cart is tucked into one corner, its silken shroud ripped open to reveal the bite-sized desserts on top."
