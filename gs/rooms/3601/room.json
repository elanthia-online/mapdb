      "A chilling wind pursues the trail here causing several small plants to sway to and fro, caught in its unyielding grasp.  To the east a flourishing garden unfolds from the edges of the rich forest.  A stream of clear water flows out from the garden paralleling the path for some distance.  Sunbeams dance and refract off of the windows and sides of a monastery, lending the appearance of a rainbow like aura enshrouding it.  Hushed sounds, like garbled voices, whisper upon the wind.",

To the east a flourishing garden unfolds from the edges of the rich forest.  A stream of clear water flows out from the garden paralleling the path for some distance.  Moonbeams dance and refract off of the windows and sides of a monastery, lending the solid edifice an air of ethereal mystery.  Hushed sounds, like garbled voices, whisper upon the wind."
