      "Vibrant friezes beckon in jeweled tones from the domed ceiling and jade-framed walls of the sanctuary.  At its center, steps radiate downward from a circular altar of red and green jade with supports carved in the shapes of feminine figures.   Censers hang from the ceiling on spiraling chains of bronze, swaying as they release sweetly scented smoke in lazy, cloying clouds."
