      "Wide and uneven, the entryway to the keep arches high above and is covered in a yellowish-white, chalky substance that exudes a foul stench.  The once firmly packed ground of the courtyard is now pockmarked with small and large holes where pieces of stone and gravel have broken free.  Directly north is the courtyard and keep tower, and an old oak drawbridge is visible past a closed and rusted out black iron portcullis.  An east-west passage traverses the wall that surrounds the Academy."
