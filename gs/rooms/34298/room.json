      "With an increase in rock-strewn ground cover and a steady incline compared to the western valley, a continued trek to the east will undoubtedly lead to the Dragonspine Mountains.  Its rising form appears to grow with each eastward step, and upper ledges and summits are hidden behind dark shadows, regardless of the hour.  Strikes of bright light appear over a distant plateau, and afterward, a resounding crack of thunder spreads through the region with a rumble strong enough to vibrate along the ground."
