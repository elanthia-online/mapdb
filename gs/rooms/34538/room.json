      "The silk canopy drapes high overheard, supported by cherrywood poles along the tent's perimeter.  Taking up a large portion of the central part of the tent is a heavy oak table with thick rectangular legs, while in one corner sits a thick pine rack.  A plush green Vornavian silk carpet lays underfoot and provides comfortable footing."
