      "Rectangular in shape, the chamber's ceiling is a soaring vault of reflective silver-gilt mosaic.  Beneath the glassy mirror is an open expanse of polished stone flooring and a half-moon rostrum, the surface raised three stairsteps above the rest of the room.  Atop the dais is a large silver chair inlaid with sapphires.  Down a step is a solid silver throne.  A carved mistwood door, paneled in silver plating, blends into the long wall of the hall, and a wide velvet-draped arch is recessed opposite the platform leading back to the main area of the keep."
