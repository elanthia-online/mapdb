      "A flight of cracked stone steps lead up the final slope of the hill, ending at the base of a large tower.  A faint breeze brings the sound of running water up from the river flowing past the base of the hill to the east.  Further on a pyramid, as tall as the hill and nearly as wide, lifts a sparkling white marble structure high above the city."
