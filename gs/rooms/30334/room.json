      "Lashed to the railings along the starboard decking, a trio of rain barrels sit covered in layers of frost and salt.  Spirals of teak peak out beneath the icy veil, the avian-carved silhouettes caught in clouds of ice.  Cast by the proximity of both the fore and aftmasts, shadows dance through the area as the ambient light slips around them."
