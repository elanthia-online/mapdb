      "All the climbing up and down over the icy rocks of this pass has exhausted you -- the bitter cold has taken its toll as well.  The ever-present wind with all its whistling and howling has come close to driving you mad.  What you wouldn't give for a hot bath, a good meal, and a tankard of mulled wine!"
