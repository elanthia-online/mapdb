    "description": [
      "The aqueduct makes a very short turn to the south and stops dead against a flat granite wall.  Several lines of numbers have been etched into the wall, and a crude arrow has been drawn that points to the upper right corner of the tunnel.  Small cracks crisscross the wall, and liquid weeps out of the cracks, sliding down the wall and leaving a trail of green minerals in its wake.  Aside from the deposits left by the liquid, the wall is very clean."
