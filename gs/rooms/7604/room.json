    "description": [
      "Standing among tumbled rocks made slick with still-wet seaweed, you gaze down at the pools of water that linger between the rocks.   Between one crevice and the next odd bits of sea-life cling, waiting for the return of the tide and the sheltering sea.  Much of the area below appears shallow and easily wadeable, even by a halfling, but there are pools that show a darker surface, hinting that they may be deeper than your first look would indicate."
