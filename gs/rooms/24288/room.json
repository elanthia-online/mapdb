      "Bleached-oak paneled walls enclose this quaint office, dampening the sounds of the bustling guild hall outside.  Light shines through a window onto papers piled on the Guild Master's desk.  A stuffed grizzly bear and sabre-toothed tiger posed menacingly stand in the far corners, and various skins hang on the wall between them."
