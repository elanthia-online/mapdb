      "Moss-covered pilings rise in uneven measures from the pond, stretching in parallel lines from the shore to deeper depths.  The flooring they supported is only partially intact, with the boards at the farthest reaches rotting and collapsing into the dark water.  What of the platform that remains nearest the shore is questionable in its stability, any certainty buried under ages of moldering leaves and fallen branches."
