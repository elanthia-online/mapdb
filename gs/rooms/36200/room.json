      "Canvas partitions form a smaller backroom, the drapery joined with tight loops.  An archway opens to the side, its upper span shaped from bent wood wrapped in narrow woven bands.  Candles rest on shorter holders carved from hollowed stumps that are set along the walls.  Large woolen cushions ring the space, stuffed densely and stitched in blocky patterns of fiber and hide."
