    "description": [
      "Fat, long larvae writhe in pallid tangles along the floor of the vast chamber, the walls of which rise in concentric tiers toward a high ceiling dripping with stalactites.  The rings are crowded with countless eggs, each roughly the size of a human child, uniformly translucent and the color of curdled milk.  Pools of viscous reddish goop bubble at the center of the chamber, attracting the larval kiramon and filling the space with a saccharine odor faintly tinged with a hint of hot copper."
