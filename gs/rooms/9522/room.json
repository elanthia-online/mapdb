      "Hemmed in to the east and north by unscalable granite walls, the bones tumble down from the south to pile up in this dark, dry corner.  The level of the bones seems about the same to the west, though, and perhaps a different flow fills that area.  The cries of hundreds of bats descend from above, reverberating off the granite walls and the piled bones to create a painful cacophony of sound.  The presence of so many bats brings another annoying feature to the area: bat guano."
