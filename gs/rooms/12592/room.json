      "The tunnel stretches away in either direction as far as the eye can see, which is not a long ways at all back into the gale that blows down from the east.  To the west, the passage slopes ever downward.  If you were to set a wizard's crystal sphere upon the ground, it is easy to imagine it rolling before the wind forever."
