    "description": [
      "High above the manor gardens, the roof slopes converge here, forming a small area perfectly pitched for sitting.  Raised above the slate surface, a roof hatch provides a somewhat comfortable back rest.  A warm breeze brushes the cool stone, bringing with it a hint of aromatic herbs and roasting meat.  Voices drift on the air, but they are distant and but a whisper of sound that does little to disturb this peaceful retreat."
