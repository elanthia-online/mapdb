      "The only thing neat about this room is the precision of beds being arranged in straight rows.  Blankets are strewn about with some on the beds and some on the floor.  Ripped pieces of paper, covered in bizarre drawings and maps, lay in pieces on the ground near a scratched wooden door.  A tall pile of dirty clothes clutters up one corner of the room."
