      "Spindled roots arch down the ragged coastline where dozens of mangrove trees laid claim to the coastline.  Verdant and sprawling, the towering beauties provide shelter from the heat of the sun and act as a barrier to the seaborne winds.  Using the only space not crowded by vegetation, a dock surrounded by boats juts out into the rolling waters of the harbor, while a slender path winds its sinuous way through the giants and deeper into the island.",
