      "Their layered dyes worn thin, colorfully painted fabric panels line the interior of the tent, depicting a continuous procession of wagons and goat-drawn carts winding across gentle hills and through lush forests.  Carefully stitched leather edging separates the scene with clean lines.  Folded chairs of various woods and woven materials ring the space, stacked neatly atop low, travel-scarred chests."
