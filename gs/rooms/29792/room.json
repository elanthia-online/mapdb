      "A sheet of crystal clear water cascades down the tower wall to splash into a shale-lined pool.  Keeping the pool from overflowing, a small stream meanders around meticulous flowerbeds before plunging off the far side of the ledge into the ocean below.  A nervous guild apprentice stands mostly hidden behind a topiary in the shape of a jumping dolphin.  A tiled marble walkway leads back into the tower through a shadowed arch."
