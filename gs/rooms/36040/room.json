      "Smoke curls from a brazier of smoldering herbs, filling the ger with a haze scented with sweet sage and resin, the wispy tendrils eventually finding their way through the roof ring.  Along the dark-stained juniper khana, backed by amber-tinted canvas, a series of hooks bear varied rows of small bags and pouches.  Neatly stacked cases rest upon a wooden display traced in subtle inlays depicting pale snow lotuses."
