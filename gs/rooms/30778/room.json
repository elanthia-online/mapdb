      "Across some debris, the main deck stretches out in both directions, from the bow to the stern of this massive warship, the wide oak planks gleaming in the moonlight a sail billows from a mast above the entrance to the cargo hold below, while a crows nest can be spotted high above.  The bulkheads are lined with cannons facing ports fitted with wooden hatches.",
