      "Shimmering lengths of silk hang from the walls of the chamber, the various shades of blues and greens create billowing waves as air flowing about the room seems to give them life.  A basket of sticks rests next to a small copper brazier that is perched on a trio of seahorse legs.  Centered in the room is a lacquered driftwood table that is surrounded by several matching chairs.  A series of bronze lanterns hang from the ceiling above."
