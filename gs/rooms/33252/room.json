      "Vaguely circular in structure, the pit is only approximately ten feet wide.  What little light reaches the bottom of the fetid enclosure illuminates things better left unseen.  Brackish water fills the bottom few inches of the room, and the constant sound of trickling can be heard as more seeps in through cracks in the pit's stony walls.  The slick fungus on the walls makes them impossible to climb."
