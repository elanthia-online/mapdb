    "description": [
      "The huge mound of the barrow looms above the small, almost garden-like entry area, its entrance a dark tunnel partially covered by an ancient, broken slab of granite.  Standing stones as tall as a giantman shield the narrow space from the harsh wind of the moor beyond the limestone arch that leads back out to the bleak landscape.  A few blades of grass grow around the stones, nourished by the rich soil and shielded from the chill wind."
