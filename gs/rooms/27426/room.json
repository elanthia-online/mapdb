      "The centerpiece of this extremely unsanitary room is a large worktable and the accompanying workbench on either side.  Both the table and the floor are littered with eclectic debris consisting mostly of fish pieces, body parts in various states of decay, and other materials used in the construction of fishing rods, lures, and tackleboxes.  A cutout in the wall allows viewing of the backside of the fish tank, and a curtained archway leads back to the showroom floor."
