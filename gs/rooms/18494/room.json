      "There are small ears of corn and large ears of corn here.  There is corn with red silk spilling out of it, and corn with yellow silk coming out.  There is even old corn with withered brown silk.  One thing that remains fairly constant, however, is that fact that the rows of corn remain too dense to see through and too tall to see over."
