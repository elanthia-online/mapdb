      "A spacious sunroom is sequestered from the grand hall by lush silken curtains that are the color of fresh-spilled blood.  Opposite the draperies, a wide stained glass window allows in daylight, the grey and scarlet panels staining the radiance with jeweled colors.  Near to a velvet fainting couch, a semicircle of chairs sits facing away from the windows."
