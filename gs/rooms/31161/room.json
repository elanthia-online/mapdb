      "Trickling in from the west, scattered shrubs and trees of nannyberries bring their burnished hues and showy flowers to grasses that grow clusters of knee and calf-heights.  Bright white, star-shaped flowers with bursts of pale pink stamen grace other bushes to the east, the delicate flowers touched with a bleed of dusty rose hues amid glossy palmate leaves.  A thin trail of sheet moss darkens the ground as it staves off more invasive crab grasses."
