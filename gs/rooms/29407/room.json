      "Outdoor copper braziers splutter and cough as their fires sink lower, expelling more noise from their kindling than warmth, but still adding a much needed luminosity to the drab, snow-packed environs.  Wreaths of heather grey smoke collect under the eaves of the stores, casually released by prying zephyrs before wafting off into the darkness."
