      "A plush rug lies before a deeply varnished desk, a welcoming sign with its warm, earthy tones.  Standing in the corner, a tall luminescent toadstool has been fringed with strands of brass beads around its cap.  A stout ametrine-inlaid cabinet complete with an impressive metal padlock on its doors neighbors the massive glowing fungus.  Hanging behind a high-backed chair is an invar-framed oil painting."
