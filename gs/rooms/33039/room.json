      "Set against a backdrop of silk-printed screens and full-length mirrors is a curvilinear, onyx-marbled counter.  Two velvet-padded chaise lounges, one black and one white, dominate the space, opposing each other on a rose-patterned rug.  Sconces upon the grey stone walls house tiny silver-sided lanterns that provide the room's only illumination, bathing it in a moon-pale light."
