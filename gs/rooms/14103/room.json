      "A spacious four poster bed covered with a blue and green comforter sits across from a fireplace.  The mantle of the fireplace seems to be made of a large piece of driftwood.  Upon this mantle sits a highly polished, vultite cased, ship's compass.  A polished oaken table with a mithril inlay of the compass points sits under the open window."
