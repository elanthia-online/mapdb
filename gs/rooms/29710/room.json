      "The spacious pavilion is cloaked in layered swathes of dark gold flyrsilk possessing a faint, nacreous sheen that glint underneath a vaalin-caged lantern suspended from the center of the room.  Glimmering carved crystal cases garlanded with sweet alyssum posies zigzag casually around the perimeter to encourage seamless browsing.  At the back, a prominent row of gossamer lace wing replicas partially conceals a thanot and haon marquetry platform that bolsters a stout jade cabinet."
