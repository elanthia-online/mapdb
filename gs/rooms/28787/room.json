      "Cozy and warm, the walls of the lounge are covered with rich burgundy brocade, and the western wall is adorned with a large portrait.  Riverstone set in gleaming copper framework composes a giant fireplace at the far end of the room, around which a tawny leather couch, a chocolate suede chaise, and an umber velvet divan are arranged in a rough semicircle.  A small polished mahogany bar curves away from the wall next to a pair of carnelian-set double doors."
