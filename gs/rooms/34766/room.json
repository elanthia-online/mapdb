    "description": [
      "Whorling nets of shadowed silk funnel down into fathomless crevices and crannies in the wall of the cave, while others hang from the ceiling like tattered parodies of curtains.  Green-tinged luminescence burning in the hearts of the sticky strands serves as an uncertain and treacherous cynosure through the stygian passage.  Toward the end, the spidersilk grows dense and more radiant before culminating in a wall of webs."
