      "The scent of freshly watered soil and warm spring air winds through the air.  Ripe and ready to pick, the artichoke globes here are tightly wrapped with their triangular petals.  Green foliage, which is abundant in its growth and volume, perks up all around each tall stalk, and the result is a field akin to a miniature artichoke jungle.  A narrow path leads into the center of the verdure, while a wider, dusty path wraps around the edge of the field."
