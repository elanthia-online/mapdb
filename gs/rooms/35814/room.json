      "Artwork of Arkati and spirits cover the walls of this alcove, portraying those that claim Liabo as home.  Inlaid with gold-filled runes, a glass-fronted cabinet stands prominently to one side, while a smaller pyrite-inlaid curio stands opposite.  Sitting snuggly between the two is a low padded chair."
