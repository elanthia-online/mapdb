      "Spanning half the length of the southern wall is a gleaming gold-speckled bar and thick glaes shelves lined with colorful bottles.  Short, reinforced invar stools have been stacked neatly in the corner should need of additional seating arise.  The majority of the lounge is dominated by an assortment of padded chairs and tables occupied by guild members sharing laughs and drinks."
