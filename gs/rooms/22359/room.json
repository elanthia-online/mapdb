      "Festooned with passion vines, a latticework is constructed over the var.  The white flowers, with their star-shaped blossoms and pale blue centers, form a lantern-lit canopy above the cobblestones.  A small alabaster building stands to one side, while a tall pale stone building is surrounded by thick hedges to the other."
