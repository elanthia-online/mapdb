      "Pale blue crabs cling to the submerged half of the pilings supporting the pier, their skittering forms clearly visible as they attempt to catch the tiny fish lingering just below the water's surface.  Tiny slivers of shell line the miniscule gaps between the planks underfoot, completely still and softly illuminated in the pale moonlight."
