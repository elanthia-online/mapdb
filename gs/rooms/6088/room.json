      "Some unknown creatures have crushed the wheat down and formed narrow paths in several directions.  No wheat or weeds grow on the compacted trail of barren soil.  Wheat next to the trails is broken and beaten down, as if some of the creatures were not so good at staying on the straight and narrow.  However, the wheat in the fields is so thick overall that these trails are not discernible until you are nearly right on top of them."
