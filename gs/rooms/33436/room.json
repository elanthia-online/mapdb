      "Roughly hewn stone walls rapidly dance silently in the flickering torchlight.  There's a constant sense of something felt yet not seen, of something important distantly whispered yet unheard.  Aspis' enchanting workshop is a place of dangerous magic, where tidy oak countertops and lockers can't conceal the raw power that its wizards attempt to harness."
