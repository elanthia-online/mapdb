      "Cozy but elegant, the polished wooden walls of this room are partially covered by two tapestries, one water-stained and one moldy, hanging from the ceiling.  A glass-fronted display cabinet is a focal point of the space, its clawed feet resting upon a tasseled throw rug beneath it.  Set in an open corner is a wide silver tray, the instruments scattered across its surface well within reach of a hard wooden stool and the black leather chair in front of it.  The faint scent of blood lingers in the air."
