      "Triumphant krolvin statues of volcanic stone stand on hexagonal pedestals in front of a fortified countinghouse at a bend in the street.  Salt and wind have colluded to erode the statues' features.  The business stands out from its immediate neighbors due to its impressive size, but all of the shops along the road are well-to-do, their coffers swollen from trade in contraband and plunder."
