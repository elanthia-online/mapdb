      "Glimmering tendrils of opalescent silk and black satin hang down from the ceiling, each toward the midpoint of its nearest wall, shrouding the source of the blue-tinged glow illuminating the wagon.  Thin panels of stone decorate the rest of each wall, their colors haphazardly transitioning from one vivid hue to another.  Silver racks and black metal racks opposite each other line the carpeted path to the ornately sculpted table at the wagon's far end."
