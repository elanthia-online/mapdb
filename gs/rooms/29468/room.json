      "Navy blue rugs bordered with braided gold rope and bright white anchors cushion the long hallway as it stretches to the east and west.  Wrought iron rings dangle from the ceiling and hold aloft glass-fronted lanterns that shed bright yellow light and dispel all surrounding shadows.  Standing opposite each other, a windowed dark red door has the words, \"Office of Petitions\" etched into its glass, while a windowed dark green door has the word, \"Vacant\" etched into its glass."
