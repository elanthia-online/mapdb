      "Three narrow tracks converge, their junction shaping a shallow clearing where grass threads across the ground in scattered tufts.  Overhead, the canopy knits tight, keeping the sky distant and dim, though faint currents of air drift through with the scent of damp earth.  Near the center rests a broad boulder, its surface softened by moss and etched with faint grooves worn by time."
