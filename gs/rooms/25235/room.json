      "A chunk has been torn or blasted from an alabaster column, its once polished surface now marred with cracks and jagged bits.  Dried blood smears the ground along the tiled stone floor, tiny dark red flakes scattered about like crimson dust.  A terra cotta bowl resides in a corner of the hall, the depths filled with shreds of discarded selshis skin."
