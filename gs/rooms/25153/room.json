      "A spire stretches into the sky above the pale compound, sandstone walls streaked with shallow grooves from the pelting of the wind-driven sand.  The tower's peak is barely visible from the courtyard, courtesy of the blinding sunlight.  Muffled moans emanate from the long, high-ceilinged building at the tower's base, drifting through one fractured window and echoing across the courtyard in a cacophony of echoes."
