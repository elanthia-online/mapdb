      "Three carved oak stands, each supporting a sizable mirror, rest against the western wall.  Scattered atop tables near the stands are a variety of brushes and bottles filled with all manner of concoctions.  Positioned to face each mirror is a cushioned chair, while a matching oak bench is set along the eastern wall for brides and grooms to rest while waiting for their turn.  Several hair artisans huddle together as they peruse a stack of parchments filled with the latest drawings of hairstyles."
