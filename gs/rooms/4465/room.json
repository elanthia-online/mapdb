      "The vaulted roof of this cave soars high overhead, supported on slender columns of fluted stone crowned with elaborate foliate capitals.  The golden light from tiers of pure beeswax candles is caught and refracted into shimmering rainbows by crystalline inclusions in the rock.  Broad shelves of polished onyx, agate, and chalcedony display the wares to their fullest advantage."
