      "Whorls of mist tease the edges of the path as it rambles to the east, and the trunks of the sweetgums and white ash trees are decorated with wide-cut burlap ribbons pinned with arrangements of colorful leaves, acorns, and dyed corn husk bows.  Faint strains of music accompany the chill in the air, and tufts of wisp lanterns light the spindly figure of the split rail fence that zig-zags southward."
