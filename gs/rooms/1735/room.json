      "Rounded boulders and huge, jagged rocks break through the valley's smooth snow floor in several places, thrusting up toward the sky.  Rabbit tracks skitter around and between these islands of stone, pock marking the snow with their padded impressions.  Something or things much larger have made indistinct impressions in the snow and left long trails across the glacier.  Bits of fur, scattered bones and frozen blood attest to violence where the tracks meet.",
