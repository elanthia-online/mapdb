      "Smooth, wave-polished stones litter the ground in a broad crescent near the waterline of the rocky islet, serving as bedding for a herd of monk seals.  The pinnipeds laze indolently on the hard ground, basking in the ocean spray and largely ignoring the pounding surf.  Despite the span's desolate appearance, scattered tufts of stubborn grass sprout from cracks in the stone, and algae clings tenaciously to the rock faces."
