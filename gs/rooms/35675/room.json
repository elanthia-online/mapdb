      "Faint flashes of bioluminescence from within the sky-scraping walls of water to either side illuminate the pathway in fell light.  The fitful radiance illuminates the shadowed form of a whale draped across the path, sweetly poisoning the air with its rotting flesh.  A few industrious crabs clack and click within the slack-jawed mouth of the carcass, skittering about as if in celebration of the bounty it represents."
