      "The rich, musky aroma of puma leather hangs heavily in the air.  There is a fireplace for warmth on chilly nights with a buckler above it, and a well-stocked bar that lends warmth upon all occasions.  Many trophy heads line the dark maplewood walls, testament to the successful hunting efforts of Argent Aspis' fearless membership.  A swinging door on the room's north side leads to the kitchen.  Next to a wide bay window is a banner with a bronze plaque surmounting the case containing Aspis' charter."
