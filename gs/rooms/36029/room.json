      "Curving along the ger's eastern interior, the hallway arcs north before meeting the western passage.  White felt forms the outer wall, while the inner curve rises in orange-dyed panels marked with narrow geometric bands.  A pair of entries open into adjoining inn rooms, their frames fitted cleanly into the felt-wrapped lattice.  Dark walnut planks span the floor in smooth, even lines."
