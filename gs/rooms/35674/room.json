      "The weight of the water seems an almost palpable thing, leaving the air heavy, close, and oppressive.  Only the invisible hand of magic holds the sea back from swallowing the path whole in a crash of crushing water.  Schools of translucent fish drift lazily within the water's hold, their shapes flickering like phantoms in the tidal darkness."
