      "The stink of offal and blood rises, heavy and thick into the cold air, and is little dispelled by the whipping breeze.  Its source is a butcher's shop with an attached slaughterhouse, though the latter is as far back from the street as the mighty basalt walls of the city will allow.  Several aurochs are tied to carts in the yard, but the smell has awakened an uneasy agitation in their normally placid bearing."
