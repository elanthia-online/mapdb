      "Gilded mesh encloses a piece of the sky, and you are surrounded by birdsong. Parrots flash their brilliant colors amidst the branches of potted trees, the birds' cries a raucous counterpoint to the trilling of plainer, but more eloquent larks.  The aviary's wire walls permit smaller birds to come and go, but even the fenvaoks seem content with their eyrie above the guild.",
      "Gilded mesh encloses a piece of the night sky, and you are lulled by soporific birdsong.  Owls continue their low-pitched inquiry of the nightingales who sing amidst the branches of the potted trees, but the raucous parrots and fenvaoks are asleep.  The moons seem nearer and worldly matters much more distant from this eyrie."
