      "Comical grotesques cavort in every other arched nook along the walls, each holding a burning candle aloft.  Combined, the flames lend a honeyed, inconstant glow to the hallway, which comes to an end in a dark-stained pine door carved with falling sweetbriar petals and tangled thorns.  A trio of jagged gouges defaces one of the empty nooks and has dislodged a few of the stones used in their construction."
