      "Black ice coats everything on the north face of the mountain.  Snow clings to it in cracks and crevices, but blows by in a flurry everywhere else.  The track is slick and climbing is perilous.  Half frozen into the ice are the tattered remains of a canvas backpack, doubtless left behind by some climber desperate to lighten his load."
