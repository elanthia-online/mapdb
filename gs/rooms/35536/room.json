      "Vibrantly inked postcards engulf the walls of the small shop, the gaps between the city-painted sheets of parchment occupied by a cluster of silk-padded pedestals draped in lattices of kelp.  A trail of bright orange and blue starfish is suspended from the lantern-illuminated ceiling, the kaleidoscopic sculptures displayed above an oversized velvet-lined clamshell propped up on a stand of sanded driftwood."
