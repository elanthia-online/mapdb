      "Patches of cerulean and sapphire iceblossoms peek out of the briar here and there, lending splashes of color to the commingling of grey and brown and white.  The mischievous little flowers seem to sprout up where the brambles are thickest, keeping themselves safe behind thorny walls that keep both the wind and clumsy intruders at bay.  One spray of blossoms is a rich violet that could rival the finest cut amethysts."
