      "An open wooden structure painted with a design of colorful fruit houses Fickle and his edible treats, keeping them safe from the elements.  Wicker baskets full of delicious fruit line the back of his stand.   Dozens of paper lanterns painted in vibrant colors are attached to a string that runs along the lower edge of the roof."
