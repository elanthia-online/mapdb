      "Thin woven runners with long, thin scenes on them hang between rows of niches carved into the walls.  Small, beautifully carved statues sit in each nook, depicting each demigod represented in the pantheon of Others.  Tasseled kneeling pillows dot the floor, and long benches make a comfortable place to sit and pray."
