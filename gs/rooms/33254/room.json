      "Stone steps, three in total, rise from the hardpacked dirt floor of the cell towards a solid door of scratched and dented metal.  Iron-wrapped oak benches are bolted to the three remaining granite walls, though space is left to allow guests to stand in the corners.  Dim, discolored light fills the space from a small rainbow glaes window that offers a warped view of the jailhouse entry."
