      "White-hot embers flitter from the mouth of a natural flue off the side of the tiered plaza, darting in the air like shining fireflies.  Radiance flickers up from the depths, dancing within the aperture in a lively pattern, the fiery glow wholly different from the wan light of nearby crystals in its patterns and intensity.  Heat stings on the muggy air, overwhelmingly intense in its constant onslaught."
