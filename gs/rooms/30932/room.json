      "Unlike other chambers within the huge banyan tree, this one is totally enclosed.  The lustrous glow of the sloping wooden walls provides a warm, golden glow, illuminated by hanging globes of amber-colored glass suspended from the irregular ceiling above.  A single worktable rises in the center of the room, fashioned from the wood of the tree itself.  Its expansive top is carved and inlaid, depicting a map of Teras Isle."
