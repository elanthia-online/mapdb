      "Stretching the length of the eastern wall, bright tiles of various hues and sizes are fitted together to create a rolling sea mosaic.  Beneath the churning waves mermaids frolic with dolphins, while sea hags coax sailors from their ships.  A large wrought iron ring anchored to the ceiling holds a glass-paned lantern over a curtained opening and provides ample illumination over the navy blue and gold rug-covered ground."
