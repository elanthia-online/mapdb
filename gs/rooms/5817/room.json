    "description": [
      "The tunnel broadens to a semicircle at its western end, leaving it wide enough to turn a wagon and a brace of horses.  A depression carved into an oblong stone apparently served as a trough, although the only remnant of the water which filled it is a rust-colored ring a few inches below its rim.  The sloping passage doubles back on itself, leading down to the southeast and away from the feeble lantern-light to the northeast."
