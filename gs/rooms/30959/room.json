      "Curving down and to the west, marble steps cut through the travertine planters that line the pathway that trails away from Pentas Avenue.  Concentric bands of gold-veined tiles form overlapping knotwork patterns upon the broad expanse, as twinkling lights spill out of blown glass orbs that reside at various places amid succulent plants and white ground-covering pebbles.  Dappling the ground with mottled shadows, starlight filters through nearby cypress trees cooling the area."
