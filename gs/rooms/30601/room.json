      "Stone grey walls surround this small alcove off the central nexus to the north.  The focal point of the space is a swirling black and red portal framed by an oval of wrought silver.  Clusters of stars have been etched into the metal, several of them spouting tails like comets.  A hot breeze swirls around the area, scented of the flora of Teras Isle."
