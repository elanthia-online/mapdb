      "Thick mahogany supports crisscross the high, thatched frond roof.  Twined strands of colored lights wrap around the beams, illuminating a pair of suspended hammocks and a battered picnic table.  The sandy ground is littered with caps and pottery sherdlets.  Off to one side, a fire pit and a plastic beer cooler sit dangerously close to one another."
