      "Six torches, each lit with a dark violet flame, are affixed upon the granite walls.  Empty coffins lay at the end of the chutes, which connect to the mausoleum above, while a crude pulley system consisting of ropes, wheels, gears, cranks, and a leather band is used to return the coffins.  A bladed pendulum swings back and forth with a large blackened skull stuck at the end, making the death trap useless in its current state.  The musty smell of desiccated bodies wafts throughout the tomb."
