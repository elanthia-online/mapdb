      "Flanked by round tables topped in vases, a four-poster bed fitted with a gauzy canopy occupies one corner of the seafoam green-painted room.  A steel-edged storage locker at its foot is filled to overflowing with shoes, while a painted oak wardrobe opposite it stands open displaying belts, aprons, and girdles for all to see.  Near the entry, a chest of drawers holds a motley variety of pouches, quivers, kits, and tankards."
