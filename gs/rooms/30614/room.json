      "Round area rugs with bright orange and yellow designs against a cobalt blue backdrop are scattered across the chamber's floor.  Above, frosted globes provide a warm glow that is reminiscent of sunlight.  Built into the southern wall, a set of double doors offer entry to a small barracks, while a peaked archway carved into the western wall leads to a small kitchen.  Several chairs encircle a round oak table that dominates the space."
