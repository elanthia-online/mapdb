      "A sturdy wooden boardwalk, painted with a fresh coat of whitewash, runs along the side of the river.  Wooden benches rest along the bright blue railing along the edge, providing a place to relax and fish or just watch the merchant boats pass by.  Houses have been built along the boardwalk, surrounded by colorful potted plants and decorative fishing nets."
