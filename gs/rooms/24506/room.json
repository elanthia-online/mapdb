      "Piles of sand lean against the base of the southern and western glass walls, which give a breathtaking view of Lake Eonak's sunlit surface.  The dark witchwood of the eastern wall is bisected diagonally by a set of straight ko'nag stairs.  A low, rectangular witchwood chest with square iron handles sits at the foot of a king-sized bed with a low, flat headboard, and is flanked by a nightstand that rests against the northern wall.  Joining the northern and eastern walls is a fireplace cut from ebon-veined brown marble.  A braided silk rug in muted tones stretches beneath a plush loveseat, positioned between the bed and a glass door that leads to a private beach."
