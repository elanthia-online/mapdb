    "description": [
      "The small balcony at the rear of the ship is constructed from painted modwir and maoral.  Enclosing the length of the balcony, a carved modwir railing provides a view of the verdant hillside nearby.  A woven acantha-fiber hammock is strung from a hook on the wall and the edge of the railing.  A glass-paneled lantern hangs from another hook on the wall of the ship, next to a glass-paneled bright green door."
