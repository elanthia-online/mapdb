      "A duo of portraits flank the sides of a feather-carved door, the paintings choked by a tangle of ivy vines creeping from tall pewter urns set beneath each rectangular frame.  An ebonwood cabinet stands flush against the emerald-colored wall, filled with a variety of curiosities contained beneath the thick panes of cloudy glass, their surfaces covered in vein-like fractures.  Perched upon the container is a tiny stuffed wren, its lifeless eyes angled down at the torn pashmina rug."
