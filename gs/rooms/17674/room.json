      "The cobblestone road curves to the northeast to run parallel with the river where several docks with large river craft are moored.  Many of the buildings along the street are made of mismatching stone blocks cunningly crafted to fit and join with odd-shaped stones.  Two statues flank a gateway set before a large two-story stone and timber house, and mirroring the statues are two tall giantmen guards.  Opposite the house is a modest wood home guarded by a single old and bent Tehir."
