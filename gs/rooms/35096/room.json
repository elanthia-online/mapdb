      "Separated from the outer room of the shop by a patterned copper silk curtain, the parlor is smaller and more intimate, though richly appointed with a soft suede couch and a small fireplace.  An ash worktable with mother-of-pearl inlay houses a number of tools of the tailor's trade, including tapes, shears, and pins.  The sanctuary is watched over by a smiling mask in gold and vivid blue that is graced with musical notes at the edges."
