      "Faded with age, the sweeping mural that covers the western wall is missing several sections of imagery where the paint has separated from the stone.  Curls of paint and lacquer mingle upon the dusty floor amid the tattered ruins of a faded carpet of pale blue.  A copper-sided display case upon the eastern expanse rests beneath iron sconces that are devoid of glass and candle."
