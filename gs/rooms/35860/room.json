      "The rushing waters of the river are met by a surging, tributary stream from the eastern bank, and the flow of the river shifts northward as it meanders between crowded canver and mistwood trees.  Thin, thorn-covered vines hang from gnarled branches that reach over the water's edge, and have conglomerated along the eastern bank."
