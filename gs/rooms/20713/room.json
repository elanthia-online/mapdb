      "Surrounded by wood paneling, this small room offers a place to sit and relax.  Several plush rose pink chairs are arranged in a half-circle, facing an arched stone-lined fireplace, a basket of sticks resting nearby.  A long marble counter against one wall holds a variety of refreshments, the wine bottles gleaming in the light from the candelabra perched on the shiny surface, as well as from a panoramic window set in the outer wall.  The hallway can be glimpsed through an open doorway, and a rounded ebonwood arch provides an egress to the north."
