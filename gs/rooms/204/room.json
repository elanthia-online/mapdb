      "A statue stands on a high pedestal at the intersection of two vars, forcing pedestrian traffic closer to the buildings at each corner.  Large, curtainless bay windows open into sunlit rooms where elves are busy painting and sculpting.  In the sunlit yard of a smaller cottage to the north, two elves bend meditatively over a crystal ball.  From your position it is impossible to discover what secret, if any, it reveals.",
      "A statue stands on a high pedestal at the intersection of two vars, forcing pedestrian traffic closer to the buildings at each corner.  Large, curtainless bay windows have been filled with paintings and statuary, lit by several oil lamps hanging from the ceiling of each studio.  A small group of elves in paint-spattered clothing mills around outside the windows, critiquing the items on display.",
      "A statue stands on a high pedestal at the intersection of two vars, forcing any traffic, pedestrian, cart or horse, closer to the buildings at each corner.  The road, save for the statue in the middle of it, offers unobstructed views of two of the great buildings of Ta'Illistim, the United Bank of City-States, to the south and Ta'Illistim Keep, to the east."
