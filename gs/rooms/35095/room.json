      "Wall panels of bronze and gold are pierced with designs representing distant landscapes, from mountains clad in wild woods to sprawling deserts.  They reflect the light of a few beeswax candles sweetening the air of the tidy shop, the space of which is efficiently devoted to dress-clad mannequins and small bolts of fine textiles.  Most are more common imports like fraelhan and velvet, though a few hold spidersilk and splendid fabrics from half a world away."
