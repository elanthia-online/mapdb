    "description": [
      "A small but sheer cliff rises sharply up, effectively preventing northward movement.  A trail leads roughly south, a thin ribbon cutting through the thick forest of towering trees.  Layers of fallen leaves carpet the forest floor, providing a rich growing environment for the flora clustering about each tree grasping for bits of light that filter through the forest canopy.  A towering old oak dominates the area near the cliff face, and almost hidden beneath its spread of branches rests a twisted and broken metal lift."
