      "Numerous displays of ships rest on polished oak shelves lining the walls of this shop, each with a framed vellum sign providing extra details.  Carefully placed for optimum visibility are pedestals highlighting other ship-related paraphernalia, and inlaid upon the oak floor is a sea glass mural of a pitched battle.  Behind the fel counter hang various pennants and flags representing a variety of navies and other nautical organizations."
