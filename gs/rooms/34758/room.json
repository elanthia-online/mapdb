    "description": [
      "A long hallway proceeds from a pair of spiraling staircases toward steps leading to a raised dais in the north.  Luxuriant curtains of flame-hued velvet soften the severity of the gallery's high marble walls, which display priceless paintings framed in gilded steel.  Sunlight is transfigured into fireglow by the brightly colored shards of the stained glass ceiling, which continues out over the narthex far below.  The masterwork depicts a sinuous black draconic figure breathing a wall of raging fire."
