    "description": [
      "Amid the fluttering of several stray hummingbirds, patterns of light and dark fleck the ground where the moonlight is able to penetrate the profusion of heavily branched trees.  Thin blades of blue line almost every inch of the trees and ground where thousands of butterflies rest beneath the humid air.  Delicate blossoms have twisted closed, waiting for the warmth and light of day to awaken them as others bloom vibrantly in the slightly cooler night air.",
      "Patterns of light and dark fleck the ground where the sunlight is able to penetrate the profusion of heavily branched trees.  Waves of blue appear and disappear along almost every inch of the trees and ground as thousands of butterflies rest beneath the humid air.  With every beat of the butterflies' wings, the jungle appears to take deep cleansing breaths.  Flitting in and out, small hummingbirds raid nectar-rich blossoms high in the jungle canopy."
