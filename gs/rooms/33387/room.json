      "Umbrageous trees watch over the glistening sands spread over the area, the rustling leaves echoing against the glass-forged hourglass set within a ring of muted sea glass.  A sturdy frame of driftwood holds the sculpture aloft while small clockwork gears slowly rotate as the fine grains fill the bottom chamber, the granules tinted the vivid colors of the sea.  Several narrow marble benches surround the hourglass, the names carved upon the seats faded by both time and nature."
