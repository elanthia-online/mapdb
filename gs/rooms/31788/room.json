      "An aged mechanical carousel creaks loudly as it turns, the small fabric ponies pierced through by thin poles carved into overlapping arrowheads.  Faded panels cover the center column of the device, the idyllic inked countryside punctured with leaf-scribed arrows, the broken shafts littering the grass-painted floor.  The stuffed ponies are covered in thick wool blankets, their heads and bodies entirely concealed by a curtain of black."
