      "Smooth white plaster walls enclose the rooftop alcove, where the floor is covered in a mosaic of small ceramic tiles in white, cobalt blue, and mustard yellow.  Intricate, repeating patterns stretch across the space, arranged with geometric precision.  A latticed canopy spans overhead, its open framework allowing light to filter through and cast soft, shifting patterns onto the mosaic floor.  The walls rise cleanly to meet the canopy, framing the space in simple, structured lines."
