      "Your wandering brings you to a small clearing.  The ground is dry and parched, and there are large lines scratched into the surface and coated in a red, sticky substance.  Following the lines a moment, you realize they make a rune covered circle, and that you are standing in the center of it.  A cold wind whips around you at that point, and you hear howls in the distance."
