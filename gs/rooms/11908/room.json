      "A thick blanket of reeds and marshy vegetation meanders alongside the river bank.  A thin pathway stamped out among the reeds climbs over a small rise to the east.  The high-pitched chirp of a frog echoes from within a stand of cattails that waves mockingly from the edge of the darkened water.",
      "A jagged stump as large around as a table sticks dangerously out of the ground at the edge of the path.  It looks as if an army of termites weakened the inner structure of the tree, leaving it prey to a storm that ripped the upper portion away from the stump.  Oddly enough, the trunk of the tree is nowhere to be seen."
