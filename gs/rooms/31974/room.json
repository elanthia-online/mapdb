      "Violet, teal, coral, and aquamarine light leaks through the cornsilk yellow straw that covers the hovel's peaked roof, casting its upper reaches in rainbow-whorled colors before diffusing to the yellowish orange hues of the sconces that line the walls.  Broad shelves, evenly hung and level, cast shadows upon several tidy worktables, while metal splinters, leather fragments, and pencil shavings are scattered about the uneven floor.   A long bench rests near the exit, its surface worn smooth with use."
