      "A sweeping staircase spirals downward in a graceful arc, the wide steps carpeted by a runner of plush ebon velvet with gilt embroidery that catches the light from a crystal chandelier overhead.  A masterpiece of carved mahogany, the balustrade is inlaid with delicate gold filigree, while each newel post bears an avian-carved finial.  On the landing, a hallway leads into a guest floor of the hotel."
