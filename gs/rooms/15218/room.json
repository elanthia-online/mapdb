      "Beneath a smoke-blackened wooden ceiling so grimy that the detailed mouldings are obscured, a gold-framed storm griffin painting hangs on one of the rough hewn oak walls.  A scarred mistwood bar covered with ages of stains from unknown liquids and a black lacquered liquor cabinet with blade-scarred doors sit in opposite corners while a mat of fresh rushes liberally sprinkled with sawdust rests on the worn modwir floor."
