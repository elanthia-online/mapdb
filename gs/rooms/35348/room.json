    "description": [
      "Refurbished tobacco wood furnishings fill the air with an earthy aroma that is sweetened by the delicate citrus and sweet clover notes of the coral and tangerine-hued ranunculus that fill the porcelain vase in one corner of the room.  An enormous bed covered in a thick comforter dominates the cobalt blue-tiled floor, while an ivory porcelain wash basin rests upon a nearby bureau.  Ebon-framed sketches decorate the stucco walls, each depicting roses in various states of bloom."
