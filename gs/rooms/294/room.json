      "This cobbled road circles the town, providing access to the bazaar and the fringes of the surrounding neighborhoods.  Several night guardsmen, wearing leather armor and bearing short swords and daggers, eye the crowds and keep watch over the dim, lamplit street, where a few traders and townsmen are going about their business.",

Several members of the militia, wearing leather armor and bearing short swords and daggers, eye the crowds and keep silent watch over the street, which bustles with well-heeled merchants, traders and shopkeepers."
