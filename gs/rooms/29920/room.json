      "Not a single pine needle mars the pristine white of the even stone road.  There is a painstaking precision to the cut of every stone block comprising it.  Light from the rippling aurora plays off of the road in a ripple of chilly hues, making the pathway appear as if it is undulating slowly, almost imperceptibly."
