    "description": [
      "An immense wall of frost-covered deadwood stretches across the misty forest.  The masses of branches have been stacked and woven together into an impenetrable barrier.  An overgrown path leads to a gate in the wall which has been framed by two mighty aspen trees. The portal has been constructed from a solid sheet of modwir and is covered with living vines which have spread along the surrounding walls, rendering it useless.  Clearly, this has not been opened in hundreds of years."
