      "A fireplace of blue flames burns silently in one wall, shedding a comfortable light over the tapestries and odd relics on the walls.  Two comfortable, high-backed chairs sit before the hearth, a small black varnished table between them.  Over the hearth hangs a magnificent dragon wrought from rolaren, the surface beaten to catch the reflection of the dancing flames."
