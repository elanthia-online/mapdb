      "Complex groupings of pale blue orbs spin through the area swiftly, their soft luminescence banishing the darkness from the room.  Positioned in the middle of the room is a massive pillar of glowing light, its surface continually spawning and absorbing the miniature spirals of glowing orbs that whirl overhead.  Deep hums of power accompany the slow, rhythmic pulsings of the pillar, its surface darkening then flaring to brilliance once again."
