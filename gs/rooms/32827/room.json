      "This simple room contains a stone workbench covered with tools.  Some long wooden handles stand upright in a reused ale cask next to a rack of wooden torch bases awaiting construction.  Shelves containing buckets of sand, paraffin chips, and bundles of burlap stand to either side of a simple ironwood door leading out.  A squat potbelly stove radiates heat from the corner, casting off a warm orange glow from its grated door."
