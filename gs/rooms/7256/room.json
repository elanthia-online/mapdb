      "Stinking mud seeps into the large rectangular depressions sunk here and there into the relatively dry ground of this rise.  Some of the filled pits to the south of the path bear markers, but no names grace the stones above the mass graves.  Those who lie beneath the markers were likely nameless even in life, and clearly none there are lamented now."
