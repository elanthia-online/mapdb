      "A pyroclasm consumed the interior of the hut, gutting it and leaving behind only a barely standing frame of wood.  What remains of the door squeaks in the breeze, swaying on charred hinges.  Five skeletons lie amidst the ruins, blackened beoynd recognition, but next to them is a man-shaped space where the floor is clear of char.  No sign of the space's occupant remains."
