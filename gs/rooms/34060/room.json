      "A silver-fringed banner of stoutfoot wool hangs from the western wall, its field embroidered with a rampant mule.  Before it stands a petrified wood desk and a comfortable chair.  The desk looks to have once been shattered into chunks, but it has been joined together by veins of dark silver.  A granite tablet sits atop the desk, riddled through with cracks but still intact.  Nacreous bands of metal stretch down the walls, twisting into intricate weaves to the north and south."
