      "Mist crawls and seethes along the ground, writhing like a thing alive.  The eddies of impenetrable fog conceal the ground underfoot, but here and there are glimpses of pocked stone etched with a pattern of interlocking wings.  A vast ebon archway rises out of the surrounding mists, unimaginably black and towering in scope.  So dark is the smooth stone of its construction that its edges and features are difficult to discern."
