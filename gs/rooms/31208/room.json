      "Trunks and crates fill most of this cramped space, the stacks of supplies making it difficult to find an uncluttered section.  Crammed in one corner amidst the jumbled containers is an intricate wooden table, its surface covered in various contraptions.  Tucked just underneath it are a copper-framed box and a bronze-hinged chest, their lids open wide.  The stuffy air sometimes stirs, sending the beads of the exit curtain to clattering.",
