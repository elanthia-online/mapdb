    "description": [
      "Heavy fog encroaches upon the twisting, turning road, so thick as to obscure the cobblestones completely in places.  The lamp posts along the road have bases wrought in the forms of swirling wraiths with their talons outstretched, the figures doing little to dispel the ill look of the area.  Several houses have lanterns swinging from heavy iron chains over their doors, as if not entirely trusting the street lights to ward off darkness.",
      "The weird way that the roads twist and turn, compounded by a thick fog, make keeping your bearings straight difficult.  The fog near the ground is so thick that you can feel the road, but you can't see it."
