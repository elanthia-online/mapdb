      "Dark-paneled walls rise up along a smooth floor of burnished grey wood.  Light from the atrium shines in through a row of high arched windows, which cast a warm glow along several fel-framed paintings along one wall.  A polished statue of a red marble lion stands to the side of a wide staircase leading up."
