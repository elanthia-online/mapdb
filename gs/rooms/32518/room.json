      "The shadow of a lone yew tree stretches long and dark over the resplendence of the overrun garden's flowers, its boughs still white with trapped snowfall.  Old and wide-bodied, the tree has an immense trunk that is thick and ungainly, gnarled from long years of growth.  A thin path proceeds underneath the conifer's drooping, scratching branches, winding northeastward."
