      "The outer edges of the flotilla are built up high here, with a reinforced archway leading to a dock system to the northwest and a small passage opening to the southwest between berthed ships and permanent protections.  The deck sprawls wide, leaving ample room for maneuvering, and a river boat is securely lashed across the south edge.  Intricately carved into the deck is a sea dragon wrapped about a small ship."
