      "The ocean depths in the midst of the flotilla sparkle in the starlight, and the deck leading up to it is covered in deep scuff marks.  A handmade sign nailed to a pole is the only item between deck and depths.  Opposite sits a repurposed warehouse, with a seashell mosaic at its entrance depicting several pirates brandishing cutlasses."
