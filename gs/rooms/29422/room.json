      "Whitewashed rafters crisscross the ceiling of this clean squarish shop, terminating at similarly treated walls that enclose the neat space.  Centrally located, a sizable table displays a model volcano decorated with colorful pinwheels.  Above the display, cloud shapes hang from the rafters overhead with a variety of toy airships floating weightlessly between them.  A large window faces the plaza outside.  The shop is fairly quiet as few patrons come and go."
