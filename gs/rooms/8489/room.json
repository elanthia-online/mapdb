      "A small altar sits at the east end of the room, silhouetted by a broken window behind it.  A large gash runs down the center of the altar, filled with slabs of red glass that overflow to cover the surface, as if it bled to death in the silence.  White and pink glass litters the floor, mixed with dried flower petals and incense ash."
