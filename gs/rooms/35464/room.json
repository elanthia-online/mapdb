      "A woven labyrinth of willow withes stretches upward from the low entrance, providing structure to the waxed hides that have been fastened to major junctures with knotted suede.  Smooth, flat boulders and rocks indent the ground, their vaguely humped and pitted surfaces cradling a variety of woodland treasures.  A lush carpet of fern fronds shows minimal disturbance, though what appears to be a natural, preexisting game path winds between the rocks to provide access."
