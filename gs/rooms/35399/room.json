      "Ribbons coil around the marble pillars, their trailing ends shifting with the breeze before falling still near the floral-carved plinths.  Stained glass lanterns sway above, casting fractured patterns over the smooth tiles below.  A wooden kiosk stands to one side, its counters lined with trays of polished stones.  Nearby, a fabric-draped stall displays raw and cut gemstones, each catching the shifting lantern light.  Moonlight filters through, glinting off the scattered facets of the wares."
