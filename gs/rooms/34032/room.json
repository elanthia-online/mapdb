    "description": [
      "Broken and devoured by time, a road of pale stone loses itself in deep snow as the highland plain gives way to a craggy arete.  To the north, the niveous thread of cultivated roadway reappears as it curves to avoid the white-clad slope of an abutting mountain.  Wind wails through the passes, low, mournful, and musical at once.  It sways the branches of nearby pines into a slow, funereal dance."
