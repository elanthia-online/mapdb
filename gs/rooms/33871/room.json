      "Paper boats of colorful origami float across the surface of a wall-attached fountain, the vessels dipping slightly as they pass beneath the streams of blue-green water.  Foliage-veiled buildings stand across the sun-lightened cobblestones, their glass-paned displays showcasing fascinators and other millinery resting on cushions of burnt velvet.  The scent of saltwater and citrus drifts across the walkway, the fragrances intermingling with scent of paperwhites blooming from chain-hung baskets."
