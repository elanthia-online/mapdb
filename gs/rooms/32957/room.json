      "Mounted on the wall behind a display table covered in small trinkets is a large parchment map showing the DragonSpine mountains with brightly glowing glaesine orbs on either side.  A small natural branch rack on the table displays curios suspended from cords and strings.  Two comfortable rocking chairs provide seating for the merchants when traffic in the complex is slow."
