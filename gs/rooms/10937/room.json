      "Colorful and detailed murals cover the walls of this shop, depicting battles large and small.  Many of the weapons on display in racks scattered throughout the room figure prominently in the scenes.  However, a few look very unfamiliar.  Wandering between the racks and a large counter, the store's clerk polishes the inventory to a bright sheen, helping his customers as he does so."
