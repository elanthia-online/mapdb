      "A small part of the forest around the oak has been cleared away.  The ground around the trunk of the tree has been hard packed by the passage of others, forming a path that leads off around the tree.  An empty set of ornate torch holders sits behind a small patch of grass at the base of the trunk.",
      "The bright light of torches illuminates the trunk of the oak and a cleared area around it.  The ground about the base of the tree has been hard packed by the passage of others, forming a path that leads off around the trunk.  The torches filling this part of the forest with light are of a high quality and rest in ornate holders.  A small patch of grass carpets the area before the oak."
