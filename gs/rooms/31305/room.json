      "Stacks of crates are stamped all over with the label \"G.E.M. Co.\"  A single crate has been pried open and reveals numerous uncut gems of all different colors and sizes.  Leaning up against a large boulder are sets of miner's tools: pickaxes, lanterns, helmets, and large satchels that are all covered in stone dust and mud.  Settled up against a worktable is a dark red, velvet-lined display filled with rough, uncut gems."
