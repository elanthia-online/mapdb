      "Creating a haze of silver, starlight filters through the open ceiling above, painting the sanctuary in a dim glow that causes the unornamented marble walls to seem ethereal.  Heady fragrances fill the air at the heart of the space, their source the large, flower-filled urns placed around an alabaster altar that sits upon a raised dais.  Enormous ironwood doors painted in a wash of moss green flank the exit, each piece carved with a silver scythe."
