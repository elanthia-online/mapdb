    "description": [
      "The iron fence that encloses the graveyard is caved inward under the weight of a fallen tree.  Its distinct species is no longer identifiable as it has been stripped of all leaves and bark, and the wood is entirely obscured by growth colonies of lichen, motley green and amber-tipped, and mushrooms of all manner and description.  A few tombstones were casualties of the falling, and one grave at the foot of a broken stone has been breached from below, with only a hand-clawed chasm left as evidence."
