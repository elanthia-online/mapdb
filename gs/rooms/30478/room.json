      "This inlet's water is nearly perfectly still, the stronger currents of the rest of the bay muted here.  Occasional lines of bubbles rising from the murky depths of the ocean bottom reveal the presence of clams, while the shadowy forms of what appear to be anemones and corals gather in small colonies between fluttering fans of seaweed."
