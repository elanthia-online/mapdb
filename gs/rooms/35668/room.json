      "Dilapidated wreckage of an ancient trireme teeters over the brink of a roaring fall of white water in the midst of the ocean where the waters part as if held separate by vast, invisible hands.  Curtains of seaspray cloud the air, glistening with rainbowed sparks in the sunlight, spiraling like swarms of fireflies.  Chunks of scattered debris from a hundred different shipwrecks are caught within the solidified walls of water, forming a dangerous path down to the drying seafloor below."
