      "Ringed in viridian-hued stucco walls, the floors of this portion of the shop are covered in a thick carpet of deep plum.  Golden orbs illuminate the shop; their ends are bound to wrought iron hangers, and their light reflect against the surfaces of the various glasses displayed upon the shelves that ring the room."
