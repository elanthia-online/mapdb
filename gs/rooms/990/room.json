      "The trail is extremely icy, steep and treacherous.  Below, the homes and businesses of Zhindel's Post cluster near the face of the DragonSpine Mountains.  The well-kept buildings with their candlelit windows give the Post the look of a toy town, but a few figures moving on the streets and between the buildings belies this impression.  Farther to the east the conifer forest spreads out in a rolling carpet of green.",
