      "The smell of ink and perfumed parchment radiates throughout the area, while a kaleidoscope of various shapes, sizes, and colors of cards is a vivid splash of hues against the otherwise plain and pallid surroundings.  Silken streamers dangle from the ceiling and droop down enough to have cards hang on them at their crease.  Built into the far-right wall is an old oak apothecary cabinet that's been refurbished, its drawers labeled with tiny golden plaques."
