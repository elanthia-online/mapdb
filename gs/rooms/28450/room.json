      "This chamber is clearly set up to facilitate dancing.  A large expanse of the floor is perfectly smooth stone, reflecting the light of the many torches along the walls.  Off to one side is a raised stage littered with musical instruments of various shapes and sizes.  Small circular tables with tall metal chairs are interspersed around the perimeter of the dance floor, and a small alcove near the entrance has some refreshments for sale.",
      "The slightly chipped stone floor shows signs of frequent use, the divots and scapes emphasized by the comical oceanic scenes painted with blatant disregard of geographical location.  A plank-framed canvas portrait leans flanked by musical instruments littered on each side, their well-polished parts casting random beams of light towards the shattered mirror-inlaid candelabra hanging high above.  A neglected grouping of furniture and dishware sits off to the side of the room."
