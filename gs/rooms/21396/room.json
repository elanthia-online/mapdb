      "Beams of sunlight stream in through large cracks in the shanty's crooked, rough planked walls, providing just enough light to see thick swathes of cobwebs hanging from nearly everything in sight.  Long strands of webbing hang down the side walls that are tied to rusty iron hooks from which dangle what appear to be crude wares.  A crooked planked door can been seen in the shadows of the back wall."
