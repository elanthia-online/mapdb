      "Blackened stone walls slick with moisture line the area, while a precariously hung lantern casts shadows throughout.  Broken bits of furniture and decorations lay strewn like obstacles as water drips steadily in one corner of the room.  A thick onyx table stands near the back wall with a silver-handled obsidian dagger resting on it while a single post of scorched ironwood stands upright alongside it."
