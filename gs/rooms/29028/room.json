      "Cutting through the area, a small brook erodes approximately two handspans of the hard-packed dirt road as it travels south.  Multiple layers of plant growth create a leafy congestion of trees as the deciduous forest sprawls along the climbing incline to the west.  Shadows play across local grasses, berry-laden shrubs, and exposed stones as they avoid the sunlight that cascades through the foliage to illuminate a nearby game trail.",
