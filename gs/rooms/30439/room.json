      "Water the brilliant blue of sapphires strikes the rock-laced island shore to the east even as it spirals foam-tinged toward a spinning whirlpool to the north.  The jagged shoreline holds all the safety of broken glass as the battering current crashes against it noisily, the sound itself serving as a cautionary warning to all but the most foolhardy."
