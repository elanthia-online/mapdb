      "Multihued banners embellished with various crests are proudly displayed beneath the eaves on the architectural hodgepodge of houses.  Adding to the pops of color that enliven the grey-cast street, planter boxes teem with muted blue vinca, sweet alyssum, and sanguine-stained coleus.  Wooden crates, washed blue and stamped with a silver oak, sit stacked beside the smeared, many-paned window of a squat shop set between prickly, leafless hawthorn trees."
