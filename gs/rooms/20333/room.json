    "description": [
      "Trapped underneath the fallen trunks of three bald cypress trees, rough stonework breaches the water far from shore, with no indication of what lies beneath the water's surface.  Skirting the edge of the black, muddy banks, small ripples of water swish back-and-forth in violent measure.  The rapid movement fills the air with a soft, repetitive noise akin to nails scratching on flesh."
