      "Three displays dominate this small shop.  A tall oak cabinet with a glass front rests against the north wall, while an oak display case occupies much of the west wall's area next to the door.  A narrow marble table nestles between the two displays.  The proprietor keeps a sharp eye on the customers from behind a U-shaped granite counter, and a curtain on the east wall apparently allows egress to another room.  The counter's shape completely blocks patrons from using this curtain."
