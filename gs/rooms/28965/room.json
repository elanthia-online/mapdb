      "Cobalt blue rugs patterned with red and gold whorls stretch across the office floor, the metallic threads dancing as the swirling light of dozens of pendant-shaped frosted globes anchored to the ceiling pulse with a variety of hues.  A lacquered golden linden counter takes up most of the eastern wall and creates a protective barrier around a portly female agent, who watches the office's comings and goings with interest."
