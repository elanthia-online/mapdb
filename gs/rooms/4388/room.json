      "Evenly spaced mullein torches create an intricate series of dancing shadows across the ore-embedded walls of the cavern.  Overhead, water seeps in from several cracks, generating an incessant dripping sound as droplets strike the surface of the puddle.  Scattered around the natural stalagmite in the center of the floor are cave bear hides.  Pushed against walls that are chock-full of nooks and crannies, are crates and boxes with the words \"special fungus\" branded in block letters."
