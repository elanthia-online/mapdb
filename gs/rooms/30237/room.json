      "Several ship banners are strung along the upper walls just above the myriad green-tinged leaded glass windows, and neatly stacked along the floors are several brightly colored canvas sails.  Dozens of coils of rope in various thicknesses and weights line the back wall and are piled up behind the polished teak counter.  A glass display in the center of the shop holds dozens of different boatswain's pipes, many looking to be several hundred years old."
