      "Opalescent stone clashes with dark, igneous rock along the smooth-hewn walls, forming beautiful interlocking shapes reminiscent of a thicket of brambles.  The chamber's doors are forged from bright golvern, their aureate hue amplified by the dancing flames of torches along the chamber's perimeter.  Barrels of provisions and crates of building materials crowd the space, seeming ill-fit for its splendor."
