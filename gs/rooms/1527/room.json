      "The sagging of overhanging upper stories has become such a problem in this small backwater that massive beams have been set in place to prevent their toppling.  The result is a cobblestoned court that resembles some kind of man-made grove of leaning, square cut trunks.  A single lantern illuminates a cracked and paintless wooden mushroom between the timbers on the north side of the court, hanging above a first floor doorway.",

A cracked and paintless wooden mushroom is barely noticeable between the timbers on the north side of the court, hanging above a first floor doorway."
