      "You break your long journey upward at a small landing, hardly more than a few planks wide.  Great stacks of lumber surround you, the sweet smell of the freshly sawn boards a refreshing change from the dank sewer below.  A small breeze comes from somewhere nearby, though the source seems hidden."
