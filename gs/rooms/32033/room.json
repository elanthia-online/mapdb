      "Deserted cottages form a half-crescent around a crumbling stone well, the wooden planks lining the roof dangling precariously from rusted nails, creaking loudly in the ambient wind.  Thin coils of fraying rope lay buried beneath dirt and broken armor, splattered in iron-colored ichor, the patterns echoed across the rim of the structure."
