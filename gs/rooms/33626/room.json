      "The row of hedges suddenly widens, exposing a fragrant rosemary topiary in the middle of the pathway.  A pair of canver trees planted to either side intertwine, forming an arch overhead and showering the ground with snowy white petals.  A fat bumblebee perches lazily among the foliage.  Sunlight glitters off something within the branches of the carefully clipped rosemary."
