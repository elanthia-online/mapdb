      "Hugging the huge bole of a giant oak, the porch offers an expansive view of the surrounding rock fields.  In the distance, a line of pitch-black forest divides the horizon into firmament and ground.  Overhead, hundreds of crows carry on a constant racket with their harsh caws.",

In the distance, a line of pitch-black forest divides the horizon into firmament and ground.  Bats wheel and dive through the boughs of the tree, their forms blurred with speed and difficult to see."
