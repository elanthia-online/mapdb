      "Long rows of turnips run northeast and southwest, except when they have to detour around large rocks.  A long, deep culvert parallels the rows on the northwest side, carrying drainage from the northeast to the southwest.  The ground has slumped into the culvert, perhaps because the soil was too waterlogged after recent rains, and many plants in the westernmost rows have been lost to the collapse while the next closest row has many roots exposed."
