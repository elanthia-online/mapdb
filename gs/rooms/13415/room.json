      "Tendrils of trumpetvine twine about the arcing designs of the gates to the north, the verdant creepers weaving a complex veil of pure green dotted with flame-red blossoms.  The sagging bough of a black willow hangs over the gate, its own whip-like vines intertwined with the trumpet-shaped flowers.  A tiny stream winds its way along and through the path, its trickling cadence mingling with the soft rustles of the leaves overhead."
