      "Marble walls adorned with a variety of artwork feature gold veining that spiderwebs across their polished surfaces, glinting in the light of pendant lanterns high above.  Dominating one side of the office is a large vault door carved with intricate Saramar runes and surrounded by six keyholes and a numbered dial.  Rustically carved pine shelves, garish against the marble, are filled with ledgers and tomes.  These shelves crowd around a utilitarian desk of carved maple, where a demure giantman debt collector studiously works."
