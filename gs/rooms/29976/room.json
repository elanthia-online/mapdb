      "As it bends toward the southeast, the corridor widens into a subterranean plaza lined with rows of copper figures.  Corrosion has eaten away at their features and spotted the statues with verdigris, but enough remains of their strong forms and proud bearing to suggest that they signify honored warriors.  Striking veins of citrine streak through the raw stone walls like bolts of crystalline lightning, arcing around painted ravens."
