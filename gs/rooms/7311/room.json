      "This small dirt annex houses crudely fashioned wooden furniture of a very functional kind.  One striking exception is a tall chair, which appears to have served as an impromptu throne on the field of battle or in the relative safety of troop encampments.  Though the chair is scarred with sword cuts and arrow holes, it is still a remarkable piece of work."
