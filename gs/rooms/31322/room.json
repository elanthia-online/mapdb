      "Repurposed crates are stacked around the wall like shelves, each cubby filled with small boxes, piles of folded fabric, tarnished statuary, and broken jewelry.  Wildly mismatched, overstuffed pillows surround the eclectic space and create an inviting ring of comfort.  Towards the northwest, in front of a wall of heavy curtains and just opposite a pair of painted silk privacy screens draped with ribbons and lace, an ornate brass tray with a fractured mirror top offers a mix of refreshments."
