      "The northern shore, the lowest point on the sandbar, accesses the sea via wave-washed shallows.  Coastal waters brim with a multitude of smaller marine life.  Salty breezes coming off the water cool the temperature to a less uncomfortable level than those potentially in the jungle or the valley, despite the density of the island mist.  With the unusual dark sand characteristic of the entire area soft, if moist, underfoot, the setting is prototypically serene.",
