      "Lined on three walls with floor-to-ceiling bookshelves, the tidy office's fourth wall is occupied by a long horizontal window offering a view into the bustling newsroom.  A small slant-topped drafting table rests in the center of the room, a cushioned high-backed turning stool placed squarely beside.  A small-brimmed hat pinned with a square-carded news credential hangs from a polished mahogany coat rack."
