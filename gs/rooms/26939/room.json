      "Providing egress to both the floor above and the one below, a golden linden spiral staircase dominates the center of this circular landing fashioned of alabaster stones.  Gauzy curtains of translucent white are bound in golden rings to create a cloudy-like halo that encircles a round west-facing window.  Five bright white globes dangle from the ceiling, their dormant interiors points of darkness in the sunlight."
