      "Shielded by four interlocking shelves of table coral, the shop sprawls across the ocean floor in a softly lit chamber.  Bioluminescent threads in the coral glow with slow, rhythmic pulses, casting shimmering blue-green light on the pale sand below.  A half-shell of tridacna gigas gleams like moonstone, its surface catching and scattering the glow.  Wares shimmer faintly atop a smooth coral ridge and an inset driftwood ledge, while an interwoven kelp ring shifts gently, its edges rimmed in flickering color."
