      "Stuffed to the brim with parcels, large canvas baskets crowd this half of the tent, aided by stacked, envelope-filled bins.  A simple lantern hangs from the pole supporting the roof, casting innumerable shadows in the crammed space.  Contrasting the chaos piled behind them, a linen-draped table and a stamped wood crate hold goods arranged in an orderly fashion."
