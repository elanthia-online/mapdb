      "Iridescent water splashes from a font of porous black stone carved into the shape of a creature with one large eye and many wings, falling into a star-shaped black stone basin.  Countless candles in blackened steel holders fill niches on the eastern and western walls, sending the shadows of the chamber into a riotous, flickering dance.  Archways in both directions are etched with multifarious eyes, a six-tentacled star adorning the keystone of each.  Ungainly, slick steps to the north clamber toward a monstrous altar."
