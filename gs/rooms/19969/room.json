      "The room is designed so the center is raised sharply, mimicking a mountaintop completely covered by a replica of a tall dark tower with its labyrinth of passages, bridges, ledges, and tunnels.  Spread out before the sprawling structure down the mountainside is a grassy plain, and one large boulder with a single flattened side lays near the base of the slope.  A metal sign on an iron stand and a small oak pedestal rest beside the three-dimensional exhibit."
