    "description": [
      "Sunlight streams through the entryway, warming the cream-colored marble of the foyer and awakening rosy veins in the masonry.  A tawny carpet proceeds to the front desk, which is scattered with a spill of orchid petals.  Amber candles burn in crystal holders at the edges of the desk, filling the chamber with a warm spiced aroma that is a pleasing counterpoint to the orchids' perfume.  A gracefully carved arch leads further into the baths, and from the corridor beyond comes the crystalline sound of flowing water."
