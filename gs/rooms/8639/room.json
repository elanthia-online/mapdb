      "Sunlight filters through the mass of ivy upon the white-painted arbor above you, tinting everything with a cheery, slightly green light.  A six-tiered fountain sits in the middle of the courtyard with a cobblestone path skirting it.  Sweet floral scents drift from the water lillies in the fountain."
