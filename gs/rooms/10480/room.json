      "Thin beams of moonlight pierce the interior of the small building, illuminating a single room with a short wooden shelf built against a badly warped wall.  A circular hole about the size of a human skull has been cut into the top of the shelf, and the area around the opening seems to have been polished by frequent use.  A sour odor emanates from the hole, which seems to lead down into a hollow area beneath the structure.",
