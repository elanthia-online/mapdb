      "Small and cozy, the eastern wall is dominated by a large fireplace flanked by arched openings.  Brushed brass sconces adorn the remaining walls, the light giving the room a warm glow that reflects softly off the libations set on a corner table.  A board hangs between two sconces opposite the pale spruce door leading to the porch, with a matching cabinet hung just beneath.  A felt-covered round table and cushioned high-backed chairs rest in front of the fireplace."
