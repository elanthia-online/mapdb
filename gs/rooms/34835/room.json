      "A small stream meanders its way through the protective hedges to the east, traveling from the woods and into the enclave where it lazily twists and turns between houses for several hundred yards before winding back through the hedges and out of sight.  To the west, thickets of shrubs interspersed with cherry trees are set behind more cottages and homes, providing a wall of privacy between them and the central hub of the enclave beyond, and aragless spheres strung on cherrywood poles line the road."
