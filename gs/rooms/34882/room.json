      "Scattered clusters of fiddlehead ferns circle the rim of a cavernous hole lurking beside the path.  High overhead, the silver-tinged fronds of a tall and spreading fern drape across the pathway, blocking much of the direct moonlight.  Refracted light from the variegated giant makes dappled shadows across the landscape of the surrounding garden."
