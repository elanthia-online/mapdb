      "The savory promise of cooked meat beckons on the breeze, escorted by the aromas of exotic spices in a tantalizing melange.  Spicers and food vendors alike crowd the eastern side of the street, but its western verge is occupied by a lapidary's shop.  Hanging over its dark blue door is an etched bronze sign depicting a multifaceted gemstone."
