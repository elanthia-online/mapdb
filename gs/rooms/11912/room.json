      "The game trail widens, pressing against the heavy overgrowth of vegetation.  A thick cluster of trees to the south of the riverbank provides a canopy over the path.  The river gently laps against the bank in a rhythmic fashion, the sound blending smoothly with the chirping of tiny insects going about their nightly business.",
