      "Marigolds and mums encroach upon the path as it slips past explosions of forsythia, shrouding the way beneath their sunny pom-poms.  Crushed to a brownish mush, countless petals litter the dirt track, only the ghosts of cheery yellow coloration remaining.  Sunflowers shoot up from the golden field, their round visages tilted downward under the weight of plump seeds."
