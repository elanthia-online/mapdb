      "Walls papered with a twining ivy pattern meet a polished hardwood floor that is uninterrupted save for a sign that rests on a carved wooden pedestal and a leaf-shaped mirror on a carved oak stand occupying space in the center of the room.  Orbs of green glass hang from the white ceiling in a haphazard pattern, casting a green light on surfaces both above and below, creating a canopy of verdant light high above.  Several attendants wander around the room, chatting with each other and patrons alike."
