      "Bounded on the north and south by steeply rising jungle highlands and on the west by a shallow freshwater pool, the valley here lies out straight only to the east.  Grasses and ferns dominate the landscape.  Thus, any travel eastward involves pushing through vegetation that grows over giantman height and is alive with a multitude of insects."
