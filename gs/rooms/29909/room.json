      "Smaller clusters of longhouses look out over the frigid waters of the Issenflow, which laps at the dark shores of the village.  Several serpent-headed boats are beached along the waterside, along with great oars made from spruce.  One close to the river is peppered with tiny arrows which, despite their small size, are buried deep into the wood of the hull."
