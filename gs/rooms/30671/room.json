      "Numerous treaties, messages, journal entries and other artifacts of one culture meeting with another cover the four smooth stone walls of this otherwise undecorated meeting hall.  A vast hardwood table bound with heavy strips of glaes extends outward from the northern wall and ends near the chamber's entrance, resting upon thick legs of grey-blue marble.  Chairs and stools of every conceivable size are scattered over a fine carpet of woven glaes mesh."
