      "The square oak table has been intricately carved with a longsword and shield and painted in gold and crimson.  A thick piece of glaesine covers the carving protecting it from spills and damage.  Crimson velvet covers the padded seats of the chairs that surround the table, offering a comfortable place to rest."
