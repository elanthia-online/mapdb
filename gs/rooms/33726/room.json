      "Gold veins in the polished white marble floor create a random pattern that is partially covered by a colorful woven sea grass carpet.  Several cushioned chairs are placed about a large riverstone fireplace, a small basket of sticks nearby.  Crafted from dark marble, a blackboard hangs above a small copper pot of leafy green ferns.  A pair of brass sconces is lit, their candles illuminate the room with a soft glow that reflects off the clear crystal walls of an aquarium."
