      "Elaborately carved columns reach up to support a seamless, perfectly domed glass ceiling.  Sunlight spills freely into the large space, illuminating several intimate seating areas of soft chairs and couches.  A pair of heavy red silk curtains hang from ebonwood hooks on the eastern wall.  The western wall is covered in a vivid mural, and the north end of the sunroom is a small grey marble staircase."
