      "Sheltering within the shade of the curving granite walls, feathery and starburst clematis blossoms spring from vines that cling to the stone face to create a cascade of vibrant color.  Green, white, or yellow eyes dot the center of each blossom, which blooms in hues ranging from pale pink to rich burgundy and every shade in between.  A fuzzy carpet of moss phlox paints the ground in purplish-red hues amid low-lying steam that filters in from the east."
