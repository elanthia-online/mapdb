      "Small and large rugs are stacked upon the ebonwood floors of the wagon's sleeping quarters, their woven patterns decorative and varied.  Fitted into the back half of the wagon, a large box bed occupies much of the space, though its underside has been cleverly fitted with a variety of drawers for convenient storage.  A pair of bronze sconces flank on either side of a bright off-white door that leads to the backyard."
