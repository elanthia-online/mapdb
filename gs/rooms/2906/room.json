      "The tunnel is narrow and rough, its sides pocked and notched.  Sharp protrusions and angry-looking gouges mark every twist of its tortuous progress.  The wounds in the rock look recent.  Since the corridor meanders in such a haphazard squiggle, little light penetrates from either end.  Most noticeable, though, is the silence.  The wind's constant dirge finds no admittance here."
