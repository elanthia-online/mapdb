      "Moonlight illuminates the sandy beach that is tucked between the rocky cliffs of the coastline, leading towards the silvery expanse of water.  An enormous firepit is dug into the beach, and white wicker tables and chairs are scattered around.  Towards the interior of the island, a door provides entrance to a glass-enclosed tunnel that disappears under the white wall of a waterfall cascading from the cliffs."
