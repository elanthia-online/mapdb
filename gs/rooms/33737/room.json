      "Carved from granite, the floor is smooth and warm from underground heat currents.  A slate blackboard hangs from the wall opposite an arch that leads back to the hallway.  A large mistwood bookcase covers another wall, its shelves full of a variety of tomes and books.  Several iron sconces hang above an overstuffed couch."
