      "Sunlight sifts thinly through the blue sheet of ice that forms one wall of this large cave.  Glittering granite rock forms two long, low walls that come to a point deep in the darkness.  This haven, though smelling strongly of bear, offers a quiet spot to collect your thoughts.  An ancient pile of blackened bones and shreds of cloth is a reminder to move along before you freeze to the floor.",
