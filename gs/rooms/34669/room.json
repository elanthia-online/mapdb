      "Bronze braziers hang from the central beam of the ceiling by glittering metal chains, warming the air and casting the surroundings in firelight.  Guards stand ready by the double doors of the entrance, armor and weapons mostly concealed by dark cloaks.  Columns proceed northward, flanking a gold-tasseled scarlet runner as it proceeds toward the clerks' desks."
