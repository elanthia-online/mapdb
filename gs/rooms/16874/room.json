      "Haggling dwarves carefully inspect the wares for sale, creating quite a ruckus in this corner of the monstrous cavern.  Numerous catalogs filled with both elaborate and simple designs lie open on stands beside a clerk station.  A secluded area blocked off by a large iron partition provides a more remote setting for private negotiations."
