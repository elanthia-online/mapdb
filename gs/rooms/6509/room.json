    "description": [
      "A stream dissects the road to the west, and beyond it, a ridge stands sentinel with a fringe of conifers adding a plumed frill to its profile.  Looking to the northwest, the trees recede and a body of water is visible in the distance.  The old highway branches here, leading northeast and south.  The main thoroughfare appears to have been the south byway, for to the northeast, the turnoff dwindles quickly into little more than an overgrown path."
