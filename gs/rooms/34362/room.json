      "Thick and heavy, the excessive humidity is harsh enough to leave one gasping for fresh, cool air, which is severely lacking in this cave system.  Connected bridges and ledges create a navigable circle around a large chasm, and a foreboding tunnel is evident on the south ledge.  Connectors of questionable craftsmanship, made from fraying rope and moldy ironwood planks, bridge the gaps between the platforms and ledges, which would otherwise be unreachable."
