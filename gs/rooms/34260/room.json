      "The construction of the terrace is clearly not of humanoid design, eschewing conveniences like steps and siding and favoring organic shapes with odd elongations.  Looking as if it is grown rather than shaped, the stone has wide pores and a faintly translucent patches that are reminiscent of rosin.  At the terrace's northwestern extreme, it stretches into a languid bridge spanning to another platform constructed above the lowest reaches of the cavern."
