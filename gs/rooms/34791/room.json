      "Imposingly tall and ancient trees appear in the distance on either side of the road.  Nearby, in place of what used to grow wild and free, intertwined saplings and decorative shrubs have been planted into a more formal arrangement.  Beyond the reach of this gardened area, a border of stone keeps the hindrances of the encroaching wilderness at bay."
