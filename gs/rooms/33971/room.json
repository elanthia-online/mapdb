      "A lushly green canopy casts dark shadows across the area, the trees and vines creating it crowding, but not yet obscuring, the cobblestone pathway.  Hints of an opening are visible through a vine-draped arch leading southwest, but to the northeast, the foliage looks denser.  Nevertheless, a brightly colored, arrow-shaped sign points in that direction, and all the vegetation gives the sign a wide berth."
