      "A circular pond splits the chalk-covered cobblestone road, the vibrant blue waters covered in emerald lilypads and toy boats folded from wax-sealed parchment.  The faint sounds of quacking emanate between the confectionary-covered hedges along the walkway, followed by rustling that causes the nearby swings to sway from their branch-hung perches."
