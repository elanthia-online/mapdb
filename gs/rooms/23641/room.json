      "Running the entire length of Tuckered Inn, the establishment's porch is given a generous view of Mews Lane by its higher elevation.  The avenue stretches north, its row of houses neat and their stoops spotless.  Halflings hurrying along in the chilly wind look small and huddled up against the air's inhospitable temperature."
