      "The steel structure looks like it once was a vehicle of some sort.  Glancing out the cracked portholes, the machine has what resemble wings on both sides, but the vehicle itself doesn't appear as it was meant to fly.  A steel chronometer lies on the dashboard that has been heavily damaged; it also appears to be what controlled the vehicle.  Above all the wreckage, a shattered glass hatch serves as the only exit."
