      "Cracks spiderweb across the uneven stone of the ceiling.  From a gash in the rock flows a sluggish fluid, so dark a garnet in color as to be almost black.  The fluid drips slowly down one wall and has eaten away at the pigments of the mural there, filling the air with a tang of bitter copper."
