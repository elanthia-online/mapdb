      "Forged metal candelabra adorn the ebonwood-planked walls of the shop, the dancing flames illuminating a vase-adorned glass display framed in dried florals and bundles of herbs.  A velvet-lined blackthorn box sits nestled between rich lengths of jewel-toned velvet, the fabric wrapping around the marble pedestal before spilling to the wooden floor.  The faint lingering scent of incense pervades between the walls, the thin tendrils of smoke dissipating across the framed sketches interspersed between the candles."
