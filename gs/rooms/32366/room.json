      "The pale grey walls of the office appear almost white when bathed in the moonlight that streams in through a large window overlooking the street below.  Two weapon racks stretch out above a heavy oak desk which fills the space before a huge, red bearskin rug.  A plush, large-backed couch is situated between a slate-topped bar and a wide, fur-lined dog bed."
