      "Trapped behind a high wrought iron fence is a sprawling neighborhood of abandoned dwellings, dark trees, and winding roadways.  Shadows dance around flickering lights within the depths of the area, their soft glow creating an eerie atmosphere and doing little to dispel the general gloom.  A large gated entry, its face decorated with a shattered coat-of-arms, bars entry."
