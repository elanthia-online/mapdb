      "A woven paeline overhang, dyed with circular, kaleidoscopic pastels, rests atop the makeshift ironwood frame of the small stand.  Resting beneath the overhang, a villswood table is tucked away from the elements to ensure the quality of its wares.  Small flyrsilk-lined baskets are mounted on the rear wall, piled precariously high with a selection of yarns for sale."
