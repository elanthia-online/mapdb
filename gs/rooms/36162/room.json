      "Dusky blue tubes plated with refined veniom stand as tall as a man and far wider, lining the interior hull of the ship.  The metal sparkles dimly in the half-light.  They resonate faintly with the constant vibrations twitching through the ship, releasing a faint hum into the cool air.  Glass pipes full of rushing water direct their frothing current eastward toward a steadily pulsating light source."
