      "A stylized iron porthole marks the circular window that allows one to gaze out at the bright, churning sea.  A small table decorated with carven images of numerous underwater creatures adds to the coziness of the slightly small space, and the dark benches on either side of the booth further add to the intimate ambiance.  A single brass oil lamp sits near the window, its dim light overpowered by the sunlight streaming in.",
