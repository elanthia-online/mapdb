      "Dark cherrywood paneling encloses the room, hung with gold-chased wall sconces and lit with dancing flames.  A detailed circle of runes dominates the center of the floor, worked in pearlescent white tile amongst the greater pattern of sinuous crimson shapes.  Tightly rolled sheaves of paper peek out from small niches in the numerous scroll racks that line the walls."
