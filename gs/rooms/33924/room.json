      "The natural grey granite walls of this chamber are filled with one foot square, runed brass plates from floor to ceiling.  Troops of blue-tinted white toadstools fill low stone troughs around the edges of this cool chamber, subtly providing blue-white light.  Two benches occupy the corners of the eastern wall for any who wish to pause in the serenity of the environs.  Twin crypt-lined corridors lead to other rooms north and south."
