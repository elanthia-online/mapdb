      "Angled roofline windows tinted with hues of yellow cast a warm glow, giving a decidely jaundiced pall to everything and everyone.  Sconces filled with lightly fragranced bdellium oil soothes without overshadowing the scented wares.  Pale amethyst glass globes illuminated by fiickering wicks help offset the sickly hue, prisms fragmenting along each surface where the crystal has crazed.  Half-curtains of neutral linen can be levered into place to cut natural illumination when it gets too bright."
