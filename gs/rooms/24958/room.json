      "A short distance from the village square, the trees are thicker and the houses sparse.  A low and sturdy building constructed of rough-hewn oak logs sits on one side of the lane, facing a large warehouse on the other.  A line of carts, stacked high with petrified wood, stretches past an empty grain bin and silo."
