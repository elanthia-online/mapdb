      "A large domed structure of solid granite rests in the middle of a grass clearing, seemingly out of place from the bustling streets outside.  The dome of gold rises grandly from the roof of the building, providing a shining beacon in the moonlight.  Brilliant stained glass is set along the bottom circumference of the dome, adding a touch of color to the gold.  A narrow cobblestone path leads to the massive oak doors that provide entry into the building.",
