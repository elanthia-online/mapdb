      "The narrow wagon has been decorated with tall curtains of green-on-ebon tartan, the excess fabric neatly folded upon the wood-planked floor below.  A lacquered mahogany tray encircled by sprigs of holly sits at the center of the room, displayed upon an overturned barrel branded with the name \"Fryzel\".  A display of carefully stacked ceramic steins flanks either side of the barrel, each unique drinking vessel painted with a variety of landscapes."
