      "The tireless dripping of subterranean water, brackish and cold, has worn rivulets out of the floor as it approaches a low cliffside descending to a lower portion of the cavern.  Little pools ripple with each falling droplet, none deeper than a handspan.  The water lends a faint mineral tang to the air that is sweetened by the unpleasant perfume of rot drifting from somewhere nearby."
