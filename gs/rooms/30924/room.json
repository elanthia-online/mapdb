      "The path skirting the base of the banyan tree halts at the foot of a small pond.  Water trickles from a three-tiered waterfall ingeniously fashioned from moss-covered boulders.  Water lilies send up huge, fragrant blossoms from the pool's surface, and dragonflies as big as birds hover above on wide, brilliantly colored wings.  A curtain of buttress roots lift from the back of the pond, orchids clinging to the wood in a riot of blooms."
