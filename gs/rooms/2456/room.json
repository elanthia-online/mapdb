      "The windows of the town's jail look out over the road, the bars guarding them filigreed with silvery rime.  Across the road from the jail, a dark-eyed halfling leans against the wall of a barrister's office and quietly observes the passerby.  A rocky path winds toward the jailhouse's door, passing by a large boulder with a few crude etchings on its surface.",
      "The barred windows of the Icemule Trace Jailhouse look out over the road here.  A rocky path winds toward the jail door, passing by a large boulder.  Across the road from the jail, a dark-eyed halfling leans against a building wall and quietly observes the passersby."
