      "Newer stones give the low border wall to the south a mottled appearance, which is only enhanced by the dappled sunlight that filters through the spear-shaped leaves in the canopy above.  Tufts of alpine grass grow in verdant patches along the twisting game trails, while plum and gold crocuses grow between the roots of the surrounding aspens.  Tiny sumac saplings manipulated into looping arcs form the frame for a domed shelter woven with colorful ribbons and decorated with hawk and grouse feathers.",
