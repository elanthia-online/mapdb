      "Ebon tiles, speckled with rainbow-hued mica, are fitted amongst oddly shaped onyx slabs to form the floor and ceiling of this compact chamber.  Golden chains descend from the ceiling to support obsidian bowls that are filled with fire, their flickering light creating chaotic patterns upon the reflective walls.  Moonlight invades the space via a round east-facing window and casts its silvery light upon a golden linden spiral staircase that offers passage to the upper and lower chambers."
