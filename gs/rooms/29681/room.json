      "Colorful globes are suspended from an oilcloth ceiling, their warm glow filling the space with a multitude of bright colors.  Oak frames treated with glossy lacquer are suspended from the cloth walls, while wooden shelves stacked with paper rest upon a plush carpet of overlapping hides.  A large sign greets customers as they enter, its precise lettering bright white on the black canvas."
