      "Dipping down between two low hills, the road's constant undulations begin to flatten.  Crippled by a broken wheel, an ash-covered wagon stands abandoned by the roadside, denuded of its contents.  Whatever beasts of burden bore it have been cut free.  Scorch marks riddle the wooden bed.  The wagon has been deserted for long enough that grasses and patches of wildflowers have sprung up within the shelter of its shadow."
