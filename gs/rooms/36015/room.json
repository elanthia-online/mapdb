      "Chunky Saens Valaire nanny and billy goats meander along the paddock's outer edge, keeping close to a grass-tied birch sapling fence as they nose through the low grass.  Within the enclosure, stoutfoot rolton younglings and a variety of fluffy lambs cluster in loose groups, their small forms shifting across the open ground.  Trampled paths cross the interior in pale lines where hooves have pressed the grass flat."
