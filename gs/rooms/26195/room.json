      "The surface of the table is carved in the shape of a large flounder, with a pair of shells set in for eyes.  The same care apparantly was not taken in the creation of its base, which is completely uneven and causes the table to shift drastically.  The seats surrounding shift also, with no chair leg the same length as any others."
