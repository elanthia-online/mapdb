      "Overhead, ancient chandeliers hold candles beyond count.  Their flickering radiance awakens icy blue glints in a broad vein of razern in the cavern's ceiling, evidently preserved on purpose as the walls and ceiling were hewn by the hall's builders.  The languid arc of a black stone bridge inlaid with blue glaes and pure gold joins the dais to the west with a wide gallery to the east."
