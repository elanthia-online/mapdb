      "Pieces of seaweed and other ocean vegetation drift past, caught on the foamy remnants of waves as the current relentlessly drags them along.  Not far away, the occasional sea otter breaks through the surface of the shadowy ocean water in a playful frolic as they take advantage of the cooler climate of nighttime.  Moonlight glistens from the surface of their slick forms, creating diamond-like shimmers that mimic the reflection they create on the rolling ocean surface."
