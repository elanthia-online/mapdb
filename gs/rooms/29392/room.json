      "The spacious wagon's lofty walls are blanketed in smooth sheets of flyrsilk that are woven throughout with intensely pallid floral patterns, starkly contrasting with the deeply colored rosewood beams that peak overhead.  A fine-grained white monir reliquary emerges from the back, accented by a spiraling presentation of pale beeswax candles that washes the space in golden light and undulating shadows."
