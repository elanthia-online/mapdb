      "The entire rear of the tent is lined with a wall-to-wall shield rack, while off to the side sits a worktable laden with a variety of capped paint jars and a cup of drying brushes.  A discarded, paint-strewn apron is draped over the stool pushed just under the lip of the worktable, beneath a fringed drape of dyed suede scraps that overflow the work space."
