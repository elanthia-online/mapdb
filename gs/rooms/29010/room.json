      "Gleaming brass rods line the narrow, linden-paneled hall from entrance to the carved maoral counter opposite.  Pennants and bannerols of a multitude of hues and designs drape from the rods, nearly obscuring the walls.  The flags are illuminated by cylindrical glass lanterns, the flickering light dancing upon the soft sheen of their fabrics."
