      "Beneath the counter, wooden shelves are neatly arranged with various goods, some in labeled boxes bearing markings from far-off provinces.  A green glass bottle lies empty on the temporary flooring, the rough aspen planks cobbled together to raise the shop wares a few inches off of the soft ground.  A pair of muddy boots sits in a corner."
