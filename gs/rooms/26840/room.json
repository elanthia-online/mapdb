      "The cobblestones are almost buried in snow as they approach the Viridian Coil tavern.  The area in front of the entrance is hard-packed dirt from the near-constant foot traffic.  The entrance is filled with light from the many candles flickering inside of cages that hang from the mistletoe-strung posts flanking the door.  A row of seedy brick buildings looms behind the inn, silhouetted against the starlit sky.",
      "The cobblestones are quite worn as they approach the Viridian Coil tavern.  The area in front of the entrance is dusty, hard-packed dirt from the near-constant foot traffic.  A post stands on either side of the entrance, each one supporting a square iron cage with several thick pillar candles inside.  The rear of the inn is cast in constant shadow by the row of seedy brick buildings looming behind it.",
