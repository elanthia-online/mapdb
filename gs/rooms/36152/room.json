      "This elegantly appointed room, with cherrywood-panelled walls and a floor of snow white alabaster, offers a comfortable place for the weary adventurer.  Several wingback armchairs upholstered in soft leather are drawn up around a black marble fireplace, above which is set a beveled glaes mirror.  Various flagons and carafes rest on a cherrywood bar nearby, which is flanked by twin banners bearing a serpent's head.  An opalescent feystone medallion gleams at the top-most joint of the mistwood arch leading into this room."
