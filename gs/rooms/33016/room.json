      "Plants are scattered about the room.  Some of the plants rest in large pots nestled to either side of the marble hearth, others hang from the ceiling or sit in tall brass stands.  The pale oak floor is covered with a thick maroon carpet, which perfectly matches the upholstery of the chairs and comfortable looking sofa."
