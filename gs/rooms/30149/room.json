      "Thick gold-tasseled crimson rugs cover the natural mahogany floor, complementing the gold-flecked ivory granite walls.  A pair of ebon leather wingback chairs flank an ornate cedar table in front of an expansive fireplace.  Tucked into the far corner is a modest lor bar complete with rows of liquor bottles on shelves behind it and a dark fel dart board nearby.  Heavily curtained windows allow some light to filter in, keeping the room cozy and cool despite its abnormally large size.  A glass-fronted case sits proudly beneath a stained glass window.",

A pair of ebon leather wingback chairs flank an ornate cedar table in front of an expansive fireplace.  Tucked into the far corner is a modest lor bar complete with rows of liquor bottles on shelves behind it and a dark fel dart board nearby.  Curtained windows, which have been pulled back, allow moonlight to filter in, keeping the room cozy and cool despite its abnormally large size.  A glass-fronted case sits proudly beneath a stained glass window."
