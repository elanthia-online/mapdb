      "The wood of the tree opens into a large gathering area, with dozens of places to sit formed by tree branches and moss-covered stones.  Next to the bar stands a graceful harp, apparently formed of the same wood as the walls.  Hanging on one wall is a polished walnut dart board carved in the image of an owl and off to one side a counter nestles amidst greenery.  The lilac-twined arch leads into the ballroom beyond the bar, and a modwir door leads outside."
