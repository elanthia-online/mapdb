      "Situated across from a wooden wheel and laced with coils of thick, braided hemp rope, a wooden capstan is prepared to weigh or drop anchor.  A viciously barbed harpoon is tangled in a mess of nets near a short flight of stairs with a wooden door at bottom leading to the quarters of the captain.  A dagger-pierced parchment on the door displays a skull and crossbones."
