      "Atop a white stone staircase, a circular gallery echoes the round shape of a frosted red and ice blue glass dome far overhead.  Suspended from the center is a rustic silver chandelier that fills the area with the amplified glow of refracted candlelight.  A small halfling child statue leans against a decorative railing at the top of the stairs, gazing downward with childlike wonder on her finely crafted face."
