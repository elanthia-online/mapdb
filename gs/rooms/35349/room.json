    "description": [
      "Refurbished tobacco wood furnishings fill the air with an earthy aroma that is sweetened by the delicate citrus and sweet clover notes of the parchment white and plum ranunculus that fill the porcelain vase in one corner of the room.  An enormous bed covered in a thick comforter dominates the cobalt blue-tiled floor, while an ivory porcelain wash basin rests upon a nearby bureau.  Ebon-framed sketches decorate the stucco walls, each depicting wrens in various stages of life."
