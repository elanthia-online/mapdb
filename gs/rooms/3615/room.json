      "A jumble of boulders is piled against the far wall where the hallway dead-ends.  The ceiling has dropped, its ragged surface little higher than a dwarf near the impasse.  Light barely intrudes into the half-gloom, casting uneven designs on the walls.  The air is still and dusty, lacking the currents which breathe a better atmosphere into the more finished hallways of the stone fortress."
