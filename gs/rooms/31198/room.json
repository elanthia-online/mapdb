      "Thick iron mullions and wooden trusses support the large sheets of glass that separate the cold alpine air outside from the warm and oppressively humid air inside this vivarium, made all the more intense by the sunlight streaming through the glass ceiling.  Throughout, lush plants and vines have been woven around the wooden posts and beams that form the walls of the pens located at the center of the enclosure.",
