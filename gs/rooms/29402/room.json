      "A pair of eahnor-caged lanterns frame the open doorway that leads back toward the main section of the cabin.  Centered along the easternmost wall is a glass-topped table supported by artfully carved spindly oak legs.  A glass showcase stretches along the northern wall, and a tall oak-framed mirror is pushed into a corner."
