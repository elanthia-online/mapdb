      "Sunlight streams through a brightly colored, stained glass window built into the peak of one wall, the dappled light painting a silver-hinged white birch door in vibrant, dancing hues.  Wooly bright white rugs stretch beneath a four-poster ebonwood bed, the lavish pieces providing a contrast to the bright blue of the haon floor, while a variety of carved meadowlarks hold aloft snowdrops in their curved claws.  Towering over the scene, a carved armoire is flanked by a floor-length mirror on one side and a small table with a white ivory basin and cloth-covered shelves on the other."
