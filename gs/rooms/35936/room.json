      "Scattered apple trees dot the terrain, which is covered in small and large boulders draped in yellow and green moss.  Resting within the ring of trees is a small ivory-canopied stall, its smooth expanse covered with a pyramid of murky white glass cider carafes.  A mustachioed huckster paces between the stall and a pile of brick-colored balls, his friendly glances drifting to the aurora-laced sky."
