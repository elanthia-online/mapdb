      "Having been carved from the very bedrock of the Dragonspine gives this chamber a cave-like ambience.  Numerous crypts marked by columns and rows of rune-etched plaques fill the walls and corridors that lead to the south and east.  Standing in the northwestern corner, the statue of a dwarf examining a piece of ore is lit from below by pots of glowing toadstools."
