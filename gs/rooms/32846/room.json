      "Ramie silk carpeting extends down the hallway, patterned in shades of pale gold and green.  A cushioned white oak bench rests against the wall between a mistwood arch and a rune-embroidered ash grey curtain.  Climbing up a miniature trellis is a rosebush, its pale pink blossoms contrast and complement the pale ivory walls."
