      "Cerulean roses hang over the mossy brick wall enclosing the patio, dappling the ground with their gently swaying shadows.  Wenge tables and benches are spaced about the enclosure, shaded by black canopies patterned with plum-colored flowers.  Smoked glass windows proceed along the wood-paneled exterior of the tea shop.  The smell of steeping tea creeps through the front door, perfuming the air with floral and herbal notes that are as soothing as the gentle breezes that whisper over the wall."
