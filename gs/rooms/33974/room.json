      "Liana vines creep up the tall trees crowding the cobblestone pathway, their grasping tendrils interweaving with branches to create an arching canopy overhead.  Leading somewhat northerly, a vine-choked trail branches off from the main road.  A riot of blood red fungi scatter across decaying stumps, interspersed with virulent orange stalks of slime mold.  An arrow-shaped sign points east."
