      "Creating a semicircular barrier, a rich mountain hemlock grove casts shadows upon the burgeoning shoots of frost-kissed lupine that rise above more delicate chocolate lilies.  Bristle-headed sedge trails across the steep slopes of Cysaelotar to the northeast, while a narrow track winds through the fragrant, ungroomed puffs of alpine grass.  Banners in crimson and ebon snap in tugging breezes, their emblazoned faces difficult to discern in the constant movement.",
