      "Glistening with moonlight and the spray of the ocean, the line of black teeth-like rocks continues to rise proudly from the depths of the shadowy water.  Clouds and patches of the starlit sky are visible through the gap between two of the dark sentinels, and the vast, featureless expanse of deep, blue ocean stretches to the horizon in an endless shimmer."
