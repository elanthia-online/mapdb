      "Harbored within silver-kissed sea holly and tall, blue-green seagrass, a tiny bungalow fashioned of white-washed grey driftwood glitters in the sunlight.  Sanded planks of pine traverse the distance between the beach and front door, while yellow-eyed fleabane and tangles of delicate sea lavender blossom around the support posts.  A thin stream dips beneath the wooden walkway, its salty water feeding into a tidal pool with rhythmic abandon.  Hugging the northeastern curve of the bungalow, a pearly white shell-lined pathway ending at an iron gate disappears into the structure's shadow."
