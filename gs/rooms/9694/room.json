      "The trail emerges through the maze of tree trunks into a small glade, edged with shade-tolerant redbud trees and, here and there, a dogwood with its white blossoms that float in the low light like moths.  Ferns create a dense, circular carpet beneath the trees, dotted with white blossoms of wild orchids.  Birds chirp in a riotous din overhead, hidden by the black leaves of the glade's guard of trees.",

Ferns create a dense, circular carpet beneath the trees, dotted with the white blossoms of wild orchids.  Crickets, hidden in the ferns, chirp in a constant chorus."
