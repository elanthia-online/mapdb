      "Positioned along the southeastern edge, a bright white felt ger and a ruddy dumpling-shaped ger face a web of narrow trails that branch into different parts of the village.  Beyond their circular forms, the grasslands rise and fall in long, wind-shaped waves.  Directly opposite, a line of alternating larch and birch steps climbs the hillside, each tread set into the earth in a steady progression that leads toward the gathering space above."
