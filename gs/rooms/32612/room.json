      "Cushioned loveseats and decorative chairs in a color spectrum of green hues litter the open, airy floor plan.  Hand-painted silk walls depict abstract herbs and flowers cascading from ceiling to floor in a repetitive pattern.  Beams of moonlight stream through an arched window, the gossamer curtains lightly moving with the slightest hint of air as patrons walk by.  A white ash sideboard curves around an antique pewter stove topped with a gilt-foiled white ceramic kettle."
