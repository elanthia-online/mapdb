    "description": [
      "The vessel's deck is laid with sturdy planks of dark oak, worn smooth by years of boots and brine.  The central mast rises like a spine from the heart of the ship, thick with rigging and taut lines.  Mid-deck, a wide hatch sits flush with the planks, its iron handles used to lift the heavy cover.  At the stern, the captain's wheel stands, forged of iron-braced wood, its grip worn from constant use.  Behind the wheel is a stout wooden door set into the sterncastle opposite a gangplank leading to the pier below."
