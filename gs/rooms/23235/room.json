      "Several small braziers provide both warmth and light for this small, tidy room.  A variety of richly appointed tapestries adorn the walls, while plush pillows and throw rugs are scattered along the floor.  A pair of nautical flags is displayed upon one wall, while a clothed scarecrow and several chests occupy the room's corners."
