      "A bronze bell hangs beneath a misty grey flyrsilk sail fastened to a wooden mast towering overhead.  Down a steep companionway, a collection of barrels are lined up in front of a pile of cannonballs to replenish the munitions alongside some cannons on deck.  A section of rigging has snapped loose above a shadowy black ironwood gangplank, the rope swinging back and forth in the constant breeze."
