      "Only slivers of sunlight pass through the gaps where the morduska hide panels are lashed tightly to wooden poles, protecting the delicate wares from the elements.  Floral festoons, intense in coloration, effuse a pervasive perfume that is exceptionally potent within the warm confines of the tent.  Securely nestled in the sand, yucca baskets mingle alongside rickety crates inked with weatherworn, barely identifiable Seareach crests.",
      "Only slivers of moonlight pass through the gaps where the morduska hide panels are lashed tightly to wooden poles, protecting the delicate wares from the elements.  Floral festoons, cast orange from a hanging lantern, effuse a pervasive perfume that is exceptionally potent within the warm confines of the tent.  Securely nestled in the sand, spiral-woven yucca baskets mingle alongside rickety crates inked with weatherworn, barely identifiable Seareach crests."
