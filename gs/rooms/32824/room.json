      "Row upon row of rune-carved columns march northward into the depths of this spacious hall.  White marble arches crisscross from column to column, creating a rib-vaulted ceiling overhead.  Polished hexagonal tiles fit neatly together spanning the floor throughout the solemn space.  Along the marble-finished southern wall, heavy iron sconces hold aloft lit torches that emit a soft golden light above a cobblestone arch that provides an exit back to Zul Logoth.  Visitors shuffle through with quiet reverence, pausing to inspect each column"
