    "description": [
      "Massive turquoise stones frame an ancient ruin nearly swallowed by the merciless jungle.  Intricate carvings depicting long-limbed figures of proud bearing sweep elegantly across the masonry, gently aglow in the sunlight caressing the stone.  Ivy and vines fight for purchase across the cyclopean facade of the immense building, the latter boasting ethereal white flowers with diaphanous petals.  A wide stone basin before the entry arch is filled with perfectly still water, cold and crystal clear."
