      "A thick, gurgling sound echoes throughout a torch-lit undercroft littered with bubbling, mud-filled pools in a series of crescent shapes.  Thermal water flows from a natural spring into a fluted fountain in the center of the room, the cascade capable of showering away all traces of black mud.  A trail of muddy footprints lead through an archway."
