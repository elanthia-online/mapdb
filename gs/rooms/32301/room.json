    "description": [
      "The roadway cuts between small banks of fresh snow, the diamond powder glowing faintly in the moonlight.  Here and there, banks of resting poppy poke pink, periwinkle, and purple heads out of the glinting snowfall, their leaves a bluer shade of green than the needles of the Olbin spruces growing further from the roadside.  A patch of wintersbite has grown across the road, the intrusive little creeper's vines stretching delicately over the hardpack."
