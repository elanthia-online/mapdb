      "Three large windows allow sunlight to flood this plainly furnished room.  A simple, frameless bed sits directly on the hardwood floor, across from a wooden desk and chair.  Several bows and quivers full of arrows line a rack along one wall, and a tall wardrobe sits in the corner.  The only decorative items adorning the room are a wall hanging of an elven crest and a framed paint-splotched hide."
