      "The thick fog reduces visiblity to the surrounding reeds, great brown and tan stalks that rise high over head and frame the twisting soggy pathway.  Muted screams from unknown inhabitants filter through the thick, white wall of mist that hides their origin and location.  Occasionally, something splashes through the water and mud just beyond the wall of reeds, drawing close, then fading away."
