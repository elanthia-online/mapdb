      "Twilight blue paint adorns the walls and ceilings of this small room, while the floor underfoot is a slightly paler shade.  Stars and constellations in silver, gold, and white span the space overhead, and gazing upward is akin to viewing the sky on a cloudless night.  At intervals, dark sconces blend into the walls but for the tea candles that burn within, accenting the stars here and there, and an archway leading deeper into the shop hides almost invisibly in the wall."
