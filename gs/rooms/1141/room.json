      "The water below is moving swiftly along the current of the Locksmehr River.  The deep roar of the rapids echoes off of the smooth rocks poking out of the river and bluffs on the surrounding banks.  A twisted pile of wood and wire lies trapped between a couple of rocks on the bank downstream."
