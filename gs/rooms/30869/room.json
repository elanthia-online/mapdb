      "Rising high into the verdant canopy, an enormous mangrove tree occupies the center of the area, causing the crushed cinnamon bark path to bow out and around its girth.  Spindled roots rise away from the monstrosity and create looping arches through which trailing vines cling.  The faint scent of loam mingles with cinnamon to create an earthy, fresh aroma."
