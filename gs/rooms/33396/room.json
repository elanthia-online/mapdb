      "The thick walls of riveted metal are affixed with mesh-caged glass containers, the carefully labeled enclosures each hung with a pair of thick leather gloves and a twine-tied bundle of dried herbs.  Less utilitarian tools and knickknacks cover the glass-topped table lofted on twin ebonwood trunks, the well-worn tomes weighed down by faceted lengths of crystals.  A diminutive sidetable sits nestled by the metal-riveted door, stacked with empty teacups and a single porcelain teapot."
