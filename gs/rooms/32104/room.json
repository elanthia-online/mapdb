    "description": [
      "The kitchen is clearly a room meant to serve a purpose, not to be beautiful.  Yet, there are gentle touches still.  The iron stove is polished.  The butcher's block is unstained.  A marble slab is set with labeled canisters of flours.  Someone has taken the time to paint a frieze high up where the walls meet the ceiling.  A single window overlooks the courtyard to the back of the cottage, its glass panes clean and clear.  Even the swinging door is a bit more colorful than is purely necessary."
