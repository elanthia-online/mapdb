    "description": [
      "The dressing room is a cluttered chamber with small space and too much furniture.  A couple of chairs sit around a dressing table with a large mirror.  Across the back wall, a row of pegs provides a place to hang clothing and costumes, lower and upper shelves are mounted to the side for miscellaneous paraphernalia.  A lantern sitting on the dressing table offers most of the light in the chamber, and a ceiling fan overhead slowly moves the close atmosphere in a paltry attempt at a cooling breeze."
