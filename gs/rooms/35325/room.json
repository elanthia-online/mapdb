      "Polished granite counters line the walls, each one adorned with free-flowing flyrsilk banners in vibrant hues.  Soft, ambient light filters through translucent panels anchored to the ceiling, each depicting dragonflies in flight, their wings catching the light and casting intricate patterns on the floor.  Between the counters, murals of Cysaegir are arranged amid those of Cysaelotar."
