      "Cobalt blue cushions are scattered about this semi-circular section of the courtyard and surround a large black glass rectangle that is filled with glowing charcoal bricks.  A short wall creates a backrest to the southern cushions and separates the cliff's edge from the travertine cobblestones.  Ocean sounds mingle with that of the fountain to the south, their varied notes playing counterpoint to one another."
