      "Constellation-painted lengths of dusk blue silk drape in gradual lengths across the crescent-affixed ceiling, the fabric entwined in arathiel-set netting casting a faint glow across the elongated dark velvet chaise at the center of the shop.  Resaeun-framed artwork of Nielira Harbor decorates the surrounding walls, the port and rooftop gardens glinting beneath the glass panes."
