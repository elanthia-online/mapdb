      "Looking down upon the common room of the inn, the landing is framed by a raw pine bannister scored with stylized claw marks.  Mounted on the walls are trophies of past hunts, ranging from an elk head to the scaled blue wings of a reptilian beast, each as wide as a man is tall.  Two doors, one of spruce and one of honey oak, break the trophy wall."
