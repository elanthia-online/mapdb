      "A wide array of mining tools are on display in this room, evidently a storage area for various implements.  A sturdy metal rack holds some of the gear, while the smaller items can be found resting on a wooden shelf.  A grizzled dwarf overseer wanders about the room, muttering something about oversized ogres roaming through his section of the mine."
