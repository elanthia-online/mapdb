      "Hushed conversations fill the pauses between tinny notes spilling from a music box in the bar, the strained melody unrecognizable.  At the center of a spindly ebonwood table, a tiny green flame flickers in a brass lantern casting an eldritch glow on the scene.  A detailed portrait hangs on the papered wall, the subject's gaze seeming to shift from time to time."
