      "A rare stretch of the village is mostly clear of the surrounding carnage.  The cluster of homes is intact if stained here and there with soot, and the smell of decay is held at bay by the gelid breeze.  A trail of blood along the cobblestones ends in a pair of bloody handprints that shatter the illusion of normality."
