      "Deep purple lavender crowds the borders of the walk, delicately scenting the air as passersby brush the plants' silvery foliage.  Fat bumblebees deftly avoid contact with the festivalgoers as they gleefully dance about the lavender's tall stalks.  A large boulder rests beside the path, a painted wooden sign affixed to its worn surface.",
      "Deep purple lavender crowds the borders of the walk, delicately scenting the air as passersby brush the plants' silvery foliage.  Small torches, tiny glaesine globes atop slender ironwork poles, dimly light the path as it winds through the lavender's tall stalks.  A large boulder rests beside the path, a painted wooden sign sign affixed to its worn surface."
