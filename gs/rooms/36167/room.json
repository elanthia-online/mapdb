      "Thin, flowering vines creep along the stone walls in this underground space.  Overhead, the root system draping down from the ceiling is twisted into an elaborate chandelier that illuminates the richly appointed quarters.  Set atop a fel and willow floor, a pair of dark-hued divans is arranged around a low table.  At the base of a spiral stone staircase, a gold-edged mirror is dark rather than reflective."
