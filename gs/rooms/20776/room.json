      "Broad stone steps lead up towards a narrow building constructed of marbled quartz.  Thin ribbons of grey, blue, and pink streak the stones, giving an almost festive appearance to the facade broken only by a dwarven statue that stands guard beside a steel-banded door.  High above, arched windows peer out over the landscape like unseeing eyes, the glass reflecting minimal light from the sky."
