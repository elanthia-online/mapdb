      "Leaded glass windows provide a glimpse of the sun-dappled back gardens.  Overstuffed burgundy damask sofas and chairs with matching footrests face a carved marble fireplace.  Exquisitely detailed tapestries adorn the ivory silk-covered walls, and an Inn News chalkboard hangs above a mahogany marble-topped bar spanning the west wall, near a wide carpeted staircase.  An antique cabinet stands opposite an ancient oak door, and a bubbling fountain can be seen through a dark stone arch.",
      "The grey stone of the manor walls is softened by a silvery wool carpet and large tapestries depicting the histories of the peoples of this land.  Comfortable chairs and a sofa, flanked by end tables, are arranged to provide a quiet spot to sit and compare notes at the end of a long day's hunt.  In the far corner of the lounge you see a silver veined marble bar, its mahogany base gleaming in the light which filters through windows overlooking the wilderness beyond this haven.",
