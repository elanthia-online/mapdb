      "The cedar planks and beams of a rolton pen stand to the northeast, barely visible through a thick screen of tall weeds.  To the southwest, a huge boulder rises from the soil to tower over the turnip patch.  The granite boulder is at least three times as tall as a giantman and twice as wide as tall.  No handholds or other climbing aids appear on the lower surfaces of the boulder, though small birds have made a few nests in the upper crevices."
