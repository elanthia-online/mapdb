      "Ambient branches are cleverly worked into the ceiling design of the hyrrad for lofty overhead support.  Widely stitched patchwork oilcloth creates the walls and is dyed a host of vibrant woodland colors that compliment the mossy ground.  A series of silk-spread tree stumps rest near the back of the enclosure, with the center occupied by a tall rowan chest."
