      "Rising from the froth and seaspray, a craggy islet is littered with debris from abounding shipwrecks.  Cracked planks, broken remnants of crates, and even a rusted anchor are scattered along its shifting shoreline, lapped by the incoming tide.  Seaweed drapes the rocks like tattered lengths of fabric, concealing sharp crags and deep fissures with water-slicked surfaces."
