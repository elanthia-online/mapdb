    "description": [
      "Sprawling along the coastline, the three wards of Brisker's Cove are surrounded by walls, with each ward having its own entry.  The gates to Comyner's Ward are monstrous, double-wide doors fashioned of ironwood and reinforced with bronze and steel.  Several pathways encircle the city, while others stretch out into the yawning desert."
