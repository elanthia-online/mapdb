      "A curving blonde oak pier awards a sweeping view of a rock-bound bight that dominates the western half of the bay dissolves into a thicket of mountain hemlock and blue cypress trees veiled in powdery, silver-white snow.  Ethereal tendrils of brume hover over the coastline and slowly wend their way down the shore, emphasizing the uninhibited sky that crowns even the furthest reaches of the starlit sea."
