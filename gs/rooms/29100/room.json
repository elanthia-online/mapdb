    "description": [
      "Cool air currents waft through the wide tunnel passage, making it a refreshingly pleasant environ compared to other parts of the underground tunnel nearby.  A small pool of clear, cold water draws many visitors, as evidenced by the tracks of skittering crabs and slithering lizards left in the sand beside the water.  Lichen, liverwort, and tiny ferms cling to small cracks and fissure along the pale limestone walls."
