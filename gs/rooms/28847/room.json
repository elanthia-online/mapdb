      "Proceeding beneath a wall carved with images of unspeakable debauchery, the plank walk begins a steady bend toward the northeast.  To either side of the path are statues of pitted igneous rock that depict hideously contorted humanoids, their limbs twisted into tentacles and their teeth shark-like and sharp.  Were it not for their deformities, their forms would be avatars of perfection, each with immaculate musculature and elegant features."
