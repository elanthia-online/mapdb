      "Pale purple walls surround this small alcove off the central nexus to the northwest.  The focal point of the space is a swirling purple and grey portal framed by an oval of wrought silver.  Myriad toadstools have been etched into the metal, their various shapes and sizes creating a lush, fungal garden.  A cool, damp breeze swirls around the area, scented of the flora of Zul Logoth and the heady fragrance of raw earth."
