      "Brilliant blue, polished haon floorboards are covered by a smattering of wooly bright white rugs, the lush floor coverings creating cozy social circles along the sharply angled western wall.  Round, high-backed chairs encircle a small carved table near a mahogany writing desk, while an oversized bright white armchair sits katy-corner beneath the watchful gaze of several meadowlark lanterns.  Near the exit, a pot-bellied cast iron stove, a rhimar-inlaid polished white chest, and a series of hanging baskets create a cozy and organized kitchenette."
