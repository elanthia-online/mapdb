      "This dark, quiet room was designed for comfort and contemplation.  Bookshelves and desks create nooks in each corner of the room beneath small but bright chandeliers.  An enormous roaring fireplace takes up most of one wall, its mantle carved from the trunk of a single tree.  Facing the fireplace is a huge overstuffed sofa flanked by comfortable chairs and sturdy end tables."
