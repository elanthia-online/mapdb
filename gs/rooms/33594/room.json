    "description": [
      "Nearly as tall as the upper branches of the surrounding forest, the hill top provides an excellent view of the surrounding area.  To the south, the river tumbles by at a stately pace through the berry-laden underbrush, while to the east the trees pay homage to a grassy plain where a dilapidated stone castle basks in the sun.  Though steep, the slope provides access to a game trail that heads back into the Cairnfang Forest."
