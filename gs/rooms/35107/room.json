      "The sounds of gushing water roar over the southern wall of the city.  Steps climb to an overlook that provides a glimpse over the fortifications, where a rushing current of frothing water plummets over the plateau's edge toward a lake far below.  A bookseller has taken advantage of the picturesque spot and has set up her cart at the bend in the road.  The titles on display come in a variety of languages, but those in the common tongue are lurid and licentious almost to the point of parody."
