      "Rows of velvet-lined sea chests, varnished rum barrels, and beaded fishing nets showcase a wide variety of goods, while behind rosewood counters, sturdy shelves await restocking.  Along one wall a row of crystal globes illuminate a long painting.  Bustling about the shop, clerks pause briefly to check inventory before returning to the back room."
