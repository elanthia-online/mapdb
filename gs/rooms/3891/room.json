      "[Bailey Meadow]"

    "description": [
      "At the western end of a small meadow stands the crumbling shell of a circular tower.  Large stones scattered about the tower's base, and the uneven line of the tower's top, are ample proof that it once stood much taller than it does now.  A gaping hole marks where the tower's doorway used to be.  The squareness of the small meadow tells you that a bailey once stood before the tower, but there is no other sign of it remaining."
