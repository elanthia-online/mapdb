      "Twisting and turning between weathered buildings of brick and pine, the cobbled alley slopes steeply downward.  Dense shadows lurk to either side of the walkway.  As if oblivious to the foreboding look of the span, an elegant little shop opens onto the alleyway, hand-drawn maps of locales familiar and foreign on display through its wide bay windows.",
