      "Imperfectly fastened modwir boards serve as walls in this room of a hastily erected shack, allowing the occasional draft and glimpse of movement from its exterior.  A multitiered alabaster rack, a multitiered blue ironwood rack, and a multitiered ebon ironwood rack are neatly arranged in staggered formation and rest securely on flat spots of the dirt floor."
