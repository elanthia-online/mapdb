      "The well-traveled road is flanked by an orderly procession of street lamps, their bases carved with thunderbolts and bearded figures with severe countenances.  Priests in blue robes wander up and down a staircase carved from the side of the glacier.  It and the ice of the road are rough enough to easily traverse without falling.  A few small burrows are carved into the ice, round doors facing the street and painted with all of the hues of the dawn.",
      "This area seems well-travelled.  Priests in blue robes wander up and down a staircase carved from the glacier, and the ice you walk on is rough enough to stand on without falling.  A few small cottages have been built from the ice, and one seems to have been encased in it, with holes drilled out for the door and windows."
