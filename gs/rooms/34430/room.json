      "This cozy space provides a respite from the chaos of the newsroom, beginning with the scent of freshly brewed coffee.  Cushioned mahogany bar stools surround a high-top butcher block bar table.  An antique mahogany sideboard resides along the back wall, its surface covered with a generous assortment of treats.  Near the west wall, a well-used leather couch sits before the warmth of an iron stove.  On the stovetop, popcorn rises from a pitter-pattering copper contraption."
