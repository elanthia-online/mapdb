      "White marble and gilded accents form a refined backdrop in the collections chamber within this section of the bank.  A polished mahogany desk with intricate inlays stands along one wall, while a mural of distant coastal vistas spans another.  Nearby, a bookcase filled with neatly arranged ledgers catches the soft light reflecting off the marble floor."
