      "Slighty leaning to the west, the small building has a bit of a disorienting cant to the walls.  None of the door jambs or window frames are perfectly squared, requiring a few moments for customers to adjust their perception.  At least the dim lighting helps, due to a lack of natural illumination, making it easier to adapt.  Though clearly on the dilapidated side structurally, the interior of the shop is well-maintained, its surfaces dusted and polished to a gleam, displaying wares for sale."
