      "Painted across the walls in vivid greens and blues is a shining sphere, whirling with shreds of white cloud and darkened by a partial eclipse.  The occluding body has left the surface of the world half in light; half in shadow.  A wide bed of grey velvet is spread out before the jewel-toned mural, light collecting on its folds in liquid pools."
