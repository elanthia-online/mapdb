      "Most of the narrow, stained floor here is covered in scraps of discarded metal.  Black alloy slabs, ready for the forge, are stacked beside a dark glaes vat of bubbling, green-tinged acid.  The walls are set with twisted black hooks, each bearing the weight of a shield.  Across the ceiling, a series of cables operate an oblong, ragged bellow beside a series of pitted metal tubes that vent upward and outward from the interior of this workspace."
