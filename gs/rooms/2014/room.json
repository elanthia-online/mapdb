      "A rickety bridge spans a surging stream, its construction little more than a few rotten boards strung together with rope as frayed as it is discolored with rot.  In the shadows beneath it, the stream boasts a rapid current that could be hazardous if underestimated.  To the northeast, the head of the stream can be glimpsed where it branches off from the surging darkness of a much swifter tributary.",
