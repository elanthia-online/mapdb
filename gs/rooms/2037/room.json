      "The tunnel widens to the north, where the opening into a larger chamber can be glimpsed.  The stone walls are fraught with cracks and cubbyholes, and in some of them, small skulls and bone fragments have been wedged.  Squeaks and rustlings that sound like rats punctuate the silence from the shadows of the rough floor and lower crevices where the fog provides a thick cover in which to hide."
