      "Light shines down into this tiny alcove from a pane of crystal set in the roof.  The temperature is almost unbearable as the sun heats the air in the small space.  Tucked away under a small overhang is a clear glass starglobe nestled in a brass base.",
      "Peeking in through a pane of crystal set in the roof, moonlight fills the small space.  The pale moonbeams send a flare of rainbow specks across the walls as they strike the window.  Tucked away under a small overhang is a clear glass starglobe nestled in a brass base."
