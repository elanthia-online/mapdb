    "description": [
      "Candles gloriously illuminate the polished stone surfaces of the castle's grand hall, a cavernous chamber that proceeds to the east and west.  There are dozens adorning a singularly immense chandelier that hangs overhead, a three-tiered confection of gold and ruby.  Huge marble floor tiles reflect the honeyed light, save at the center of the room, where jeweled tesserae form a mosaic of the house's briar sprig and rising moon sigil.  Ahead, massive double doors open onto a stone passage."
