      "The long, rickety wooden planks that make up the pier branch off both north and west, with another path leading toward more solid ground to the southeast.  The waves lap at the long supporting timbers of the pier, and gulls intermittently find their tops as a temporary perch as they circle lazily about the area.  The sea stretches for miles to the west, a wavering, unending sheet that mirrors the star-dotted blackness of the night sky beyond the phosphorescent breakers of The Fang."
