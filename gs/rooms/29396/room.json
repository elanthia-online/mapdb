      "Thick moss-hued wool felt lines the walls of this spacious tent.  Temporary beds have been set up about the perimeter, each filled with a variety of blooming flowers.  A carved wooden bench sits in the center of the area, its surface covered with a display of gems and beads.  Covered in clear waxed parchment, a skylight is set in the mistwood-framed roof allowing bright moonlight to filter in."
