      "[Animal Track, Weald Shadow]"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Berry laden shrubs form a barrier between the curving animal track and the tall cypress trees of the Black Weald.  Large stones, roughly the size of a fist, thin out a babbling brook as it crosses the narrow animal track.  Thick shadows darken the area as the taller trees of the Weald block the light."
