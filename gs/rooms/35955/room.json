      "Perched upon a glass-topped fel bookcase crowded with leather-bound texts, a taxidermy raven with a solitary, faceted onyx eye peers down the long corridor.  On one side, a child-sized carved walnut rocking chair sits vigil next to a pair of paneled pumpkin ash doors carved with interlocking vines and curling leaves.  A plush crimson carpet runner shows the way to an imposing door showcasing a gargoyle-headed brass ring."
