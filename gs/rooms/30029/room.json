      "Overpowering despite the scouring gale, the stench of canines and their leavings reeks from a set of pens along the side of the roadway.  The earth around the pens is a muddy slurry of damp earth and ordure.  Bones, picked clean of even the slightest scrap of meat, are heaped into a pile near the edge of the bordering woods."
