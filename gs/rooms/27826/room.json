    "description": [
      "Colorful rugs and padded maoral chairs are scattered along the walls of the great chamber, leaving most of the intricate oak parquet floor bare.  Tall arched windows aglow with warm sunlight line the concave sweep of the north wall.  At the southern end of the chamber, a spiraled balustrade encloses the elevated choir loft, which curves with the convex south wall and is backed by a line of narrow tapestries and stained glass windows.  Ruddy wooden beams support a vaulted ceiling given over completely to painted frivolity."
