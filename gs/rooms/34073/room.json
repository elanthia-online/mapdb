      "Banners of blue and white frame a mule-printed tent flap marking the entrance to the spacious pavilion.  Supported by a central pillar of hoarbeam that is heavily carved with penguins, polar bears, and wolves, the enclosed space is heated and perfumed by a number of pierced censers hanging from the support beams by chains of iron.  The eastern quadrant of the pavilion is dominated by a raised pine stage festooned with blue and white banners with a weathered spruce podium at the front."
