      "Two great haon tables are aligned in parallel in the center of the room.  Above them, hanging from a web of brass chains, is a massive and very ornate crystal chandelier.  A pair of stained glass windows, their panes long ago shattered, allow the sea breeze to waft through the room.  Moonlight filtering in through the windows illuminates the bits of colored glass scattered on the stone floor beneath the windows.",
