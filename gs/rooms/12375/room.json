      "Canvas hammocks suspended from the deckbeams sway in time to the ship's movement:  sleeping accommodations for the crew and the less fortunate passengers.  Empty hammocks of the onduty watch have been bundled and stowed tight to the deckbeams, and beneath each crew member's berth a small seachest is lashed to the bulkhead.  The center of the deck here is taken up by the two large hatches leading to the hold below.  From here you can go forward or aft."
