      "White bleeding-heart and crimson mournbloom flourish in beds at the base of an alabaster wall framing the garden of a temple to the north.  The temple's gates are adorned with figures in brass, their clinging attire brazenly highlighting lissome builds.  Beyond, the temple is built from blocks of white marble shot through with crimson and rose veins.  A circular fountain of the same material stands at the middle of the road, supporting a statue of a preternaturally beautiful man with outstretched arms."
