      "Granite and marl create a smooth avenue that winds through a sprawling garden.  Stone benches provide resting spots, while vibrant blooms and lush foliage line the path.  A small statue of sculpted marble stands at a fork in the path, while a birdbath, surrounded by lavender, invites local wildlife for a dip or sip."
