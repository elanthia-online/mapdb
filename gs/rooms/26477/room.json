      "Twisted tangles of kelp are knotted around the ink black trunk of an ancient leafless oak, its slick face swollen from years of watery submersion.  Dimly glowing lanterns turn their eerily illuminated faces to the unevenly cobbled street that rings the mountain, while long shadows fall upon the railings that prevent a plunge into the depths below.  Disjointed pillars are pockmarked with thousands of dehydrated acorn barnacles, yet still manage to provide support for a slanted lintel that stands guard over a wrought iron-hinged door.",
