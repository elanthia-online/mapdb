      "The path winds between drifts stacked up against the trunks of tall pines, their boughs covered with thick pillows of snow.  The lodge, a towering shadow among the southern stand of trees, sends out aromatic smoke from its hearths, as well as the mouth-watering smell of baking pastries and roasting meats.  Lights twinkle through the trees to the north, and more drifting smoke can be glimpsed above the tree line in that direction."
