      "The walls of the tunnel fall away and the ceiling rises dramatically as a colossal cavern opens up to the southwest.  An abundance of phosphorescent minerals illuminates the cavern enough to see magnificent looping helictite crystals, walls of flowstone drapery, gypsum flowers, towering columns, stalactites and stalagmites."
