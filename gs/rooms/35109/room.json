      "Crashing waves are limned on the interior of the city wall, the graffiti adding a splash of color to the hewn stone's otherwise unleavened darkness.  A melange of sweetly floral and bitterly astringent aromas wafts from the chimney of an apothecary's shop along the opposite side of the street.  Nosegays are hung over the business's porch, the delicate huskiness of white heather colluding with the soporific sweetness of resting poppy to conceal less savory aromas."
