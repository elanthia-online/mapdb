      "The immense cathedral is dark.  The candles have melted to their holders in deformed blobs, and the torches have long since burned out.  At the pulpit kneels a high man of the church.  He faces the splintered and destroyed pews, the desecrated place of worship, and weeps brokenheartedly, staff on the ground before him."
