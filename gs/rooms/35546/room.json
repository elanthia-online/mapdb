      "Formed within the natural curves of a sprawling brain coral formation, the shop is dimly lit by clusters of bioluminescent moss clinging to the craggy coral.  A central display of driftwood planks leans against one wall, runestaves strapped to it with strands of dried kelp.  Gentle currents of briny water stir hanging ribbons of sea grass suspended from the ceiling, casting shifting shadows across the uneven floor."
