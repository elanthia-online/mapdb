      "Well-worn cobblestones of ashen grey and taupe form a winding trail towards a wood-framed dark stone cottage encircled by a copse of full-grown apple trees, a thin trail of chimney smoke dancing between their sturdy branches.  A colorful garden of fruits and vegetables encloses either side of the trail, the faint sounds of buzzing and the occasional shuffle from its woodland occupants causing the fauna to rustle.  Resting next to a stag-carved mahogany bench are a variety of supplies, the gear protected by the slanted roof."
