      "Sections of shelving have been built into the walls over a glass wall case.  Soft, playful music fills the air in a happy medley of recorder and drum.  Hanging from the peaked ceiling, colorful stringed puppets dance overhead.  A little mithril gong is mounted on a frame in the corner opposite the room's displays."
