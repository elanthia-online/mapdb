      "The shrubs quickly fall away as the wall advances to the east toward the keep's gateway and portcullis.  The footpath expands to the east and adopts a more gravel-like consistency, joining a wide road leading in the same direction.  Two large stakes, driven cross-wise into the ground, are tied together to support the skeletal remains of a soldier in tattered armor."
