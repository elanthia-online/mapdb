      "A long strip of grey-bordered dark green carpet ends at a row of wide, curved stone steps leading up to an elaborate eonake-framed podium and a row of carved stone seats behind it.  To either side of the carpet, grey granite pews are arranged to face the podium.  A pair of invar-framed lanterns hang from chains overhead, one to each side of the raised platform upon which the podium stands."
