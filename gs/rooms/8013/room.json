      "This room reeks of hot iron and smoke.  Dominating the cave is a massive crucible set over a firebox of metal and stone.  A stone trough lies on the floor next to the crucible.  A thick layer of soot covers the walls, floor and ceiling except for a pair of iron rails set in the ground leading out of the cavern.  Far overhead, a narrow crack leads to the outside and a constant breeze blows upwards."
