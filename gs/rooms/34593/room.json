      "Dominating one wall is a long marble-topped worktable, the shelves above lined with jars of alchemy components.  A small counter stands on the other end of the room, next to a display of iron cauldrons, its surface covered with mortars and pestles, various pieces of lab equipment, and other alchemy supplies.  Dried flowers and plants hang in carefully wrapped bundles from the ceiling, their rich herbal scents flooding the room."
