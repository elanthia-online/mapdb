    "description": [
      "Cylindrical and two stories tall, the rotunda has a very open feel due to the lack of furnishings save for a central table set with a big vase of assorted flowers in hues of crimson and blackish purple, and the crystal-paned dome overhead.  Ebonwood-banistered curving staircases meet at the second floor landing where there is a single rosewood door.  To the east is an archway, while under the stairs is a corridor leading back to the kitchen.  An antechamber sheltering the front door is to the south."
