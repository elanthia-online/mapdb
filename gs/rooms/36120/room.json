    "description": [
      "Nestled between the river tower and the north wall of House Arcane, this small garden is a flood of greenery.  A magnificent yew tree crowds the west wall, its many trunks weaving upward like giant knuckled fingers to support a broad canopy of branches.  The eastern side of the garden, awash in moonlight, has been planted with herbs, a few root vegetables, and a border of flowers.  Still further east, the rocks of the promontory drop down to the river below, the sea gates close at hand."
