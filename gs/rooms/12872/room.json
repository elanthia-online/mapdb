      "An overgrown trail leads to an old stone mill that rests atop a small mound to the east.  Patched and faded sails, secured by thin strips of leather ties, rotate in slow circles, despite the failing breeze.  Heavy bags of grain and flour, most of which have rotted and torn, are piled at the base of the structure."
