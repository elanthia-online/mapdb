      "Brightened by daylight, a broad swathe of cultivated meadow grass is crisscrossed with small footpaths and dotted with the occasional tree.  Tall hedges enclose the festival grounds, the only visible openings a red-bricked pathway and an ironbound gate.  A moss-covered, riverstone fountain burbles in one corner, surrounded by a bright splash of roses.  A copper-banded, riverstone marker rests beside the red-bricked path.",
