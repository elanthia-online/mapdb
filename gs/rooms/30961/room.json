      "Viridian, periwinkle, canary, and citrine-hued elfin thyme spreads across the ground, providing a colorful backdrop to the stark white travertine pavers.  Enormous frosted globes rest within baskets that are perched upon incredibly tall wrought iron poles, their incandescent light illuminating the flapping pennants hung beneath.  Window-dotted storefronts hung with bright white signs line the western edge of the promenade."
