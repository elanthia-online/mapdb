      "Ornate thrones rest upon a semicircular platform of solid black glaes in the northwest corner.  Three concave walls of rough grey and black marble rise fluidly from the floor and meet at a point overhead, giving the room a rounded pyramid shape.  The dim light from the yellow-green orbs mounted on stands reflects off the polished marble floor."
