      "A large brass sea hag figurine, handsomely tarnished by time and the ocean air, sits atop the banister as if to greet guests on their way to their rooms.  A smattering of sand has collected between the planks of this landing's otherwise tidy bare wood floors.  Clinking tankards, merry voices, and other muffled sounds of life drift in from downstairs."
