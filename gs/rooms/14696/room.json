      "The trail stops at the foot of a ridge formed of columnar basalt.  Rectangular fingers of stone reach up toward the sky like square tubes of a primitive pipe organ, their dark surfaces tinged in places with bright sienna.  Crevices in the stone make climbing the ridge possible, however easier trails lead off in other directions.",
