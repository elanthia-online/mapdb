      "Steps carved like dragon scales slip past the broad landing as they pass the cafe's small entrance with their ascending and descending routes.  Flanked by low stone walls adorned with creeping thyme, this transition space offers a gathering place sheltered and shaded by the carved travertine wings above.  Iron railings, weathered by the sea air, frame the pathway, guiding visitors safely between areas."
