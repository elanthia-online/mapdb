      "Dust and cobwebs fashioned of spun cotton and bits of string decorate the rafters of the attic, while pale light trickles in through slats that board-up the space's only window.  A pair of painted toy boxes pin an enormous rug of gold, teal, and pink to the dark floorboards, their lids flown wide and their toys on display."
