      "Further from the entry and away from the shielded opening at the peak of the tent, lanterns have been attached to the support posts to provide illumination for the wares on display.  The lamplight cast dark shadows against the bound hexagonal rakkein, highlighting the glossy surface where a weather retardant has been applied.  Several mahogany trestles provide support to long planks that are laden with a variety of tartan fabrics."
