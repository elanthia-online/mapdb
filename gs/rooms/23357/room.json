    "description": [
      "A safe distance from the sheer drop of the cliff is a peaceful courtyard enclosed by manicured shrubs and trailing willow trees.  In the middle of the haven, spring water burbles out of the ground and flows into a flagstone pool that is filled with sleek blue fish.  Opposite the entry gate, a break in the outer ring of shrubs marks the start of a trail that is lined on either side with multicolored wildflowers."
