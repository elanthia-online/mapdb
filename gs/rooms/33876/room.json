      "Ebony shelves are affixed to each side of an ash grey stucco building, the elongated planks lined with terracotta pots filled with fresh herbs scenting the wood-framed entry of the shop.  An iron-framed garden thrives between the buildings, the diminutive area well-watered by a maedat-carved fountain, the crystalline liquid flowing from the rock-shaped base and dispersed along the even rows.  Branchlike chairs create a half-crescent beneath a leaf-laden pergola, the mahogany beams draped in swathes of silk."
