      "Three lines of shelving run the length of the room, ending just before a row of filing cabinets, all in dingy grey, lining the back wall.  Neat and tidy, file folders labeled in various colors rest atop the various shelves.  Although they look random, there must be a system to the way they are put on the shelves.  A small table near the door holds pots of ink and paint to add color to new file folders."
