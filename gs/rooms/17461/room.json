      "The single torch on the back wall dimly lights the smoky interior of the shop.  In the center of the floor, a throw rug with a pattern of overlapping spheres adds a nice touch to the room.  A long wood counter with a sign reading \"Don't be shy!  Step right up and order!\" is nailed to the front of it."
