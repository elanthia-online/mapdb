      "Encircled by a high stone wall, the small courtyard is paved with glossy terracotta tiles and surrounded by a border of manicured grass.  At its center, a copper-lined stone fountain housing an ornate bronze statue dominates the space, while small  and chairs are secreted away amid arching arbors of mingled tea roses and peonies.  Hidden amid calico ivy leaves, a painted door provides entry to the residence."
