      "Illuminated stained glass windows splatter the glistening cobblestones of the lane in a variety of hues as light spills forth from an eclectic curios shop that sits perched upon one corner.  Other shops with amber-lit windows gaze upon the cobbled streets, their shutters canted at angles to their whorled panes.  A railing of wrought iron lines the quiet canal, a banded wooden bench perched at its edge with a tumble of knotted vines decorating its backing."
