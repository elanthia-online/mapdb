      "Six narrow sections of wall stretch upward to meet at the center of an expansive vaulted ceiling, each situated between a pair of matching arches and bearing a single spindly silver sconce.  The surface of the ceiling seems to shift subtly, its appearance bearing a striking resemblance to the outdoor sky.  Five arched entries lead away from this nexus, each into a smaller workshop, while the lone granite archway set into the southwestern wall leads out into a stretch of hallway."
