      "Creeping vines of blackened ivy engulf the walls of the small shop, the tendrils wrapped tightly along the exposed wooden crossbeams, spilling foliage across the velvet-draped glass counter in the center of the room.  Vellum-cut lanterns of glazed parchment cast uneven shadows across the rune-etched floor, exposing the circular patterns inscribed in faded ebon chalk.  Various sealed glass jars line the back wall, filled with macabre oddities that float suspended in the luminescent liquid."
