    "description": [
      "The dirt and stone walls have been ashed and blackened by a powerful force of energy.  What was once a mage's workshop is now little more than warped wrecks of metalwork and splintered bits of wood, laden with the scent of ozone and electricity.  Nothing escaped whatever disaster occurred here, but the feeling of magic remains, putting the hairs on your arms and the back of your neck at attention."
