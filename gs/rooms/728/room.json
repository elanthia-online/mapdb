      "Opposite the city's theatre, a small garden has been planted to provide a respite from the crowded var.  Beds thick with hostas, lady's slipper, dragonstalk, and a myriad of other nameless blooming flora carpet the ground beneath thick shady monir trees.  Stone benches surround the small clearing.  A few glaesine lamps mounted on slender iron stakes gently illuminate the area.",

      "Opposite the city's theatre, a small garden has been planted to provide a respite from the urban landscape.  Carefully manicured beds of trillium, white jasmine and roses are sectioned into a symmetrically organized design, each of the beds separated from the next with a narrow walkway of silver paving stones.  Centrally set amidst the flowers is a broken blue granite column, while around the edges of the garden are several benches."
