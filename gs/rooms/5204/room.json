      "A large fire pit disrupts the blanket of sand covering the beach here.  The fire pit was once huge, and remains almost intact in spite of constant erosion of wind and surf.  A small pool of water gathers in the hole left by the fire pit.  No footprints can be seen near the pit, but thousands of insects and shellfish call it home."
