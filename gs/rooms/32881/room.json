      "Customs houses, blacksmith forges, and storage warehouses form several clusters along the southern sections of the crowded street that follows along the New Ward Wall.  Foot traffic passes back and forth between a pair of open wickets in the ironwood gates.  Due to the proximity of docks, soldiers stand at the gates watching for any mischief-makers that may try to infiltrate the more refined ward.",
      "Customs houses, blacksmith forges, and storage warehouses form several clusters along the southern sections of the crowded street that follows along the New Ward Wall.  A single wicked in the tall ironwood gates stands open to the nighttime traffic, a single guardsman monitoring those that move in and out."
