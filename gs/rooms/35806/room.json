      "Spiraling, a wooden stairwell carved inside the giant tanik hugs close to the sapwood as it climbs between platform and residence.  Fragrant and polished to a smooth finish, the interior ranges from a mid-brown hue to a dark red.  Small glass sconces are fitted over wicked oil half-bowls that illuminate the narrow way.  Sturdy and secure, a looping rope handrail drapes in shallow scallops to aid those venturing the steep stairs.  At the top soft light beckons, while below is a quiet darkness."
