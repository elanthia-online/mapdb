      "Thick walls of square-riveted iron cover the large room from floor to ceiling, the wrought metal gate framed by chainmail scabbards and narrow racks affixed vertically next to cormorant-shaped lanterns.  Iron-ringed drawers encircle the perimeter, the half-opened containers filled with vials and pouches of unknown substances.  Sigils of red-stained paint cover the visible surface of the stone staircase, the layers of repainting creating splatters of dried flakes across the metal floor."
