      "Penguins churn the frigid pool.  They swim through the limpid waters, diving and splashing with a comedic flair that provokes uproarious laughter from onlookers on the banks.  The water is freezing cold, but the birds do not seem to mind in the slightest.  To the side, an icy ledge offers a way out of the gelid drink.",
      "The water is alive with penguins.  They swim all about the pool, diving and splashing so comically that you cannot help but laugh.  The water is freezing cold, making your teeth chatter and turning your lips blue, but the birds don't seem to mind in the slightest.  To the side you spy an icy ledge that you believe you could climb to get out of the drink."
