      "The icy, dark blue water of the Northern Waves stretches out around you in every direction.  Rippling waves, some topped with whitecaps, chop up the surface and make it difficult for you to tread water.  The triple masts of the krolvin warship tower over the much smaller schooner.  You notice that a ladder extends down from the schooner's deck to the east."
