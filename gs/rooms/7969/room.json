      "The crowds waiting to pay their debts mill about, some heading east and some heading west.  The carpet underfoot is worn from years of footsteps but it still shines a soft green in the bright light.  Several benches line the walls, functional, yet comfortable enough if you wish to rest your feet for a bit.  A few still seem to be unoccupied."
