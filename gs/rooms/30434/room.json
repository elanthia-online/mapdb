    "description": [
      "Several small craft, from rowboats to rafts, spread out through the area as they anchor for the evening.  Small pinpoints of light flicker from their lanterns, casting their light to penetrate the foggy mist coalescing upon the ocean's surface.  The occasional sound of a fish bursting forth from the water's surface interrupts the rhythmic background of gently lapping water against the sides of the vessels."
