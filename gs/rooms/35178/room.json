      "Canvas-covered crates litter the room, the containers stacked ceiling-high between narrow wooden tables covered in various artifacts and piles of aged parchment.  A fine dusting of cobwebs curtains the unevenly plank-hammered walls enclosing the shop, the layers split by rusted nails dangling multiple scraps of paper and stacks of notes.  Faint whispers echo between the floorboards, the pieces of wood stained in streaks of blackish red."
