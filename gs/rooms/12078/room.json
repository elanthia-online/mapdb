      "A lone oak balances precariously on the edge of the bank where the river spreads out into a wide shallow lake.  The exposed roots of the oak cling desperately to the surrounding rock and soil.  Sun-starved meadow grass grows along the edge of the bank in sporadic patches, competing without much success with a carpet of moss that spreads around the base of the tree in lush profusion."
