      "Wide windows framed by twining gold and silver vines fill this room with light and fresh air.  Sweet rushes on the floor perfume the air with subtle fragrance.  A pair of desks -- one perfectly clean, the other cluttered with papers, inkwells, and pens -- stand side by side against one wall, surrounded by shelves lined with books.  A wide, canopied bed stands against the far wall, with an armor stand and weapons rack on one side and a rack containing a variety of musical instruments on the other."
