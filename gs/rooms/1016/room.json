      "Sheltered from the stiff breeze out on the ledge, a large, sturdy building stands against the stone wall created by this artificial cavern.  A hand-painted sign is nailed above the door of the structure.  The rough wall and ground are uneven, and marks from the picks used to carve the cave out of the mountainside are slightly smoothed by erosion, but still apparent.  Occasionally, dust rains down from above, loosened by the winds."
