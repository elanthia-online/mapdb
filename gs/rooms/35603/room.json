      "Atop the main mast, a circular wooden crow's nest sways in the ocean breeze, its timbers held together by the feeble efforts of rusting nails and splintered planks.  Frayed lines dangle from the masthead, their fibers stiff and tacky from decades of disuse.  They sway in the wind like ragged pennants, but are overshadowed by the ship's flag, which is embroidered with a scarlet siren on faded black cloth."
