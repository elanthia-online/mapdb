      "Constructed of twigs lashed together with braided strands of seaweed, the hut offers little protection from any harsh weather.  Mud-spattered tarpaulins, likely used to protect the goods during rainstorms, are thrown back over fishing tackle and other sundries set out on one wobbly table, a somewhat lopsided open crate, and a much weathered oversized chest.  Simple sand serves as the floor, while a hodgepodge of roughly planed timbers interspersed with dried grass make up the roof."
