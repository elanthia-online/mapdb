      "Lancet arches of pale limestone above the doors and windows of a building near the intersection's northwest corner set it off from its neighbors.  One more facade in the walls of stone buildings facing the streets on all sides -- the lighter stone and graceful curves create a positive image in this canyon of gloom that is Shadow Street.",
      "Lancet arches of pale limestone above the walls of an enclosure near the intersection's northwest corner set it off from neighboring walled estates.  While the arcs are routinely crafted of dark slate embellished with swirls of ebony, the limestone's lighter shade and graceful curves create a positive image in the canyon of gloom that is Shadow Street.  A carved thanot gate stands partially open in the face of the wall."
