      "Though the storage shed was barely touched by the fire, this room is in shambles.  The limb of a large tree outside, apparently broken off during a storm, now juts downward from a gaping hole in the ceiling.  Sacks of grain have been ripped open, their contents combining with years of rain, to form a thick, sticky paste on the floor."
