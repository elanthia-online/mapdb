      "Soft, thick moss carpets the floor of this small, circular chamber.  The delicate sound of a bubbling spring reflects off the smooth stone walls and fills the area with a sense of peace and serenity.  Heady aromas of mimosa blossoms and water plants waft through a shimmering portal filled with opaque green mist, complementing the underlying earthy scent of native grasses."
