      "The bedroom is lined with multiple bunk beds, each of which is separated by a large window that only has one pane.  Under each window, a small end table sits, adorned with various mementos.  At the opposite end of the room, next to the door that leads into the washroom, there is a large mirror propped up on the floor.  A small iron-banded chest and a wooden chair are placed at the foot of each bed.  A long, faded blue carpet runs the room's length."
