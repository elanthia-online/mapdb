      "A few brown sewer rats dart across the floor and scurry north, in the direction of the odor of spoiled food and ancient cooking grease.  In a far bleak corner stands a filthy cot, a heap of dirty laundry piled high at its foot.  Anchored into the southern wall is a ladder, which disappears into the total darkness that obscures the vaulted ceiling."
