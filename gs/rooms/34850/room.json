      "Blackened iron pans hang above the well-aged copper stove, the wall-length counter flanked by wooden racks of glass jars and garlands of dried herbs knotted in dark twine.  A pair of suede-cushioned stools sit on either side of the hallway, each one framed by small stacks of books and baskets filled with silken ribbons.  Thin, dust-coated webs hang from one corner of the ceilng to the next, the brittle lacework curtaining the sheets of parchment tacked onto the side walls."
