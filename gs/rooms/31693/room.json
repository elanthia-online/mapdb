    "description": [
      "Rough timber walls form the interior of this simple A-frame cabin.  Aromatic cedar competes with the sweet scents of simmering apples and spices in the enclosed space.  A plank counter holds baskets of apples in dozens of varieties.  Dry leaves crunch underfoot, mingling with a smattering of spilled spices across the otherwise smooth wooden floorboards and congregating around the base of a gnomish clockwork cider press."
