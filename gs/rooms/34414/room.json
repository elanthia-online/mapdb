      "Crafted of mahogany, a bench is placed before an equally well used worktable, small tools lay scattered over the surface, while several instruments in various states of repair rest to the side.  Several wooden boxes are stacked about and filled with an assortment of materials.  A leafy, green fern drapes over the edge of a hanging ceramic pot filled with huge cascading ferns dangling to the sill of the large, open window."
