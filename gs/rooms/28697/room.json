      "Moonlight filters in through a vaulted, glass-paned ceiling, sending motes of twinkling light to dance around the room from strands of crystal icicles strung overhead.  Beds of blooming winter roses are divided by a fountain-lined water rill leading to a magnificent conifer tree covered in ornaments placed atop a raised platform and surrounded by paper luminaries.  Parked nearby, a rolling ebonwood ladder is draped with ribbon-tied garlands and a low, parquetry bench holds a dark grapevine basket filled with evergreen sprigs of mistletoe.",
