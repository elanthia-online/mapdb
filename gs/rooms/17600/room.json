      "Rough oak planks spread from the entry at one end of the room to the dinghy-shaped bar that is surrounded by stools at the other, their slender surfaces riddled with large and small knots.  High above, a chandelier housing dozens of candles provides ample illumination for each of the various tables that are scattered throughout, while also illuminating the various signs that hang from the rafters.  A rickety staircase leads to the upstairs and connects with a balcony that encircles half of the tavern."
