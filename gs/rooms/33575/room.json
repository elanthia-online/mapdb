      "Patches of raw linen in various shapes and sizes cover holes found throughout the tent's faded walls and canopy.  Along the walls are blackwood racks with iron gridwork containing a variety of unfinished wooden branches stripped of excess bark and twigs.  Set between two of the racks is a large terracotta urn painted with an irregular pattern of scorched horsehair."
