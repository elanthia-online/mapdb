    "description": [
      "The faint rustle of the surrounding willow trees echoes against the wood and stone forming the dock area of the cottage, their branches dipping low into the river.  A rope-enforced dock extends out into the steadily flowing waters, its pillars dotted with soft moss and algae that brush against the flowing waters.  A cobblestone firepit sits within a cluster of flat-topped slate rocks, leaving a mahogany chest of various supplies half-hidden between stacks of firewood and foliage."
