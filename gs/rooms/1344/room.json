      "Following the ridge, this raised and fortified stone roadway stretches out of sight to the east and west.  A newly built ramp climbs the ridge from the north and meets the road at a gap in the battlements.  The ramp and the recent changes to the ancient roadway evidence the precision and craftsmanship that are hallmarks of dwarven stonecraft."
