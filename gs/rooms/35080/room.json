      "A pall of falling ash blankets the street.  It is difficult to tell what is the work of the volcano looming across the flats outside of the city's plateau and what has been birthed from the street's many forges.  An arms dealer's shop seeks to stand out from the rest of its ash-dusted competitors by flying a ship's purloined colors, but the flag, once vibrant green and crisp white, is stained with soot."
