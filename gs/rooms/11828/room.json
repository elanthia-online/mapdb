      "Huge chunks of granite, half-submerged in the center of the river to the north, do little to impede the progress of the rushing water.

Grey and wet, with edges rounded off by the constant erosion of the water, the massive boulders have the appearance of a herd of huge sea creatures basking in the sun."
