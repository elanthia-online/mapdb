      "Fine grit covers the shale grey floor, the particulates a result of the products housed in the lofted ceiling shop.  Work stations surrounded by tidy high-sided water troughs form neat columns down the lane, while a network of honeycomb cubbies houses a variety of paperwork near the egress.  Unwavering lights built into the ceiling keep the space brightly lit at all times."
