      "A well-tended rock garden faces toward the river, where massive boulders, tiny pebbles, and all sizes of rocks in-between are piled into unique geometric shapes.  Bentok's Adventurers' Rest towers over the east bank, where a stout wooden dock is anchored in the shallows.  The two sides of the river bubble peacefully as they join and flow north from around the sides of Ghorsa Isle."
