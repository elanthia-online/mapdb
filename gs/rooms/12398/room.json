      "A particularly large and smelly piebald pig tromps about a pool of filth.  Passers-by give both pool and pig a wide berth.  It eyes them hungrily, whuffles a bit then continues to snuffle about in the muck, searching for edible morsels.  The few run-down dwellings in the area all have sturdy fences about their front doors."
