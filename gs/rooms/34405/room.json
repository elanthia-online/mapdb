      "White spindled rails line the marble stairway and landing area, giving a view of the foyer below.  A teak bench is placed to one side, with a long ceramic planter to the other, full of flowering orchids and vines that hang down, reaching for the foyer below.  Covering the wall is a large handwoven tapestry reflecting vibrant colors."
