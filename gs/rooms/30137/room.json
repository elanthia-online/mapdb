      "Row after row of canvas hammocks threaded through hemp ropes sway from the low deckheads, while tightly stacked bunks line the walls.  Sea chests and metal footlockers are secured through staples set into the deck to ensure that they stay in place during the worst of storms.  A weathered driftwood writing desk sits in one corner next to a small wash basin."
