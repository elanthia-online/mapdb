      "The blackened sheets of iron covering this section of the deck are dimpled from countless hammer blows.  Thick bolts fasten the sheets to the rough wooden planks along this section of the deck providing firm support for a heavy wooden ballista.  Charcoal tally marks mar the wide bulwarks that stretch aft toward the ship's wheel."
