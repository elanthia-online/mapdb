      "Thousands of colorful glaes scarabs have been threaded into the woven canvas of the tent's roofing.  A large lantern hung from one of the tent poles provides illumination, the light scattering off the glaesine surfaces above.  Piled neatly in the far corner of the tent is an impressive array of broken locks, latches, keys, and other mechanisms."
