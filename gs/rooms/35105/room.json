      "Cradled by a high wall crowned with sharp spikes, a shadowed manse shelters far from the thoroughfare of the run.  Gloom clings to the sanctum, and its cavernous black windows stare out at the street like empty eye sockets.  Hanging from the lintel over the gate is a carved bloodwood sign painted with a single crimson droplet.  The foreign wood contrasts stridently with the spruce and pine signs gracing nearby buildings.  The larches in the yard have crimson needles, black trunks, and a sickly look."
