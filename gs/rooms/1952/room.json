      "Six glowing orbs light a concave wall of pure white drakar speckled with red that encompasses this well-lit antechamber.  The floor is crafted from hardened lava, leveled and polished smooth.  A thick bronze seal is set deeply into the floor, facing an obsidian archway that leads to the tunnels of Kharam Dzu.  Opposing the archway, a flagstone stairway curves in wide, angular sections as it descends."
