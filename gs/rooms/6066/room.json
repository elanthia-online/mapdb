      "The barley spiral sweeps from west to north in a wide arc, tightening its angle just slightly as it proceeds northward.",
      "Water squishes up from the soil to cover boots and feet with a wet layer of silt, and the barley plants lean precariously as one steps in between them.  The plants appear to be tolerating the moist conditions well, especially compared to their cousins to the west.  To the north, the soil appears to be much drier and the footing much firmer.  The barley spiral sweeps from west to north in a wide arc, tightening its angle just slightly as it proceeds northward."
