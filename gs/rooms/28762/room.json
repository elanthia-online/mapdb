      "This small garden is separated from the courtyard by the surrounding silvery haon trees.  A gently curved stone bench sits beneath the largest tree, scattered with fallen leaves and gently illuminated by a pale blue glass lantern on a silver post.  Across from the bench, a small dais supports a carved statue of a sleeping warcat, while the beginnings of a small flowerbed circles its base."
