      "Outside this aerie haven, the muffled shriek of the wind rises like the distant cry of a grieving soul.  A long crack on one side of the room lets in shafts of pale sunlight colored yellow by clumps of topaz prisms.  There is very little debris in here, and against the far wall, a simple pallet and a stack of thick blankets give testimony to someone's assessment of the safety of this place.",
