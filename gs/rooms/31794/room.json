      "Sinuous winged viper statues wrap around marble posts at the foot of a sweeping staircase leading up to a chandelier-lit landing.  The landing splits to the east and west, the carpeted steps climbing up and vanishing from sight.  From a high vantage point mid-flight, a young lady peers out from an oak-framed oil painting, her emerald eyes seeming to follow the retreating footsteps of the hotel guests."
