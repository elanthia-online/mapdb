      "Suspended from exposed oak beams, across a white-washed ceiling, are several iron rings, their ends dangling candle-filled glass globes.  A thick dark blue cotton rug covers the limestone floor and shows signs of heavy foot traffic, especially near the brass-handled oak door that leads out to the street beyond.  Cloaks hang from pegs to the right of the foyer, above benches where a trio of girls share a book.",
      "Soft candlelight spills from glass globes that are suspended from exposed oak beams of the white-washed ceiling by large iron rings.  Shadows line the walls where the light does not reach leaving a single reading bench with little illumination.  A withered old woman bends down on her hands and knees as she attempts to scrub the day's dirt from a blue cotton rug that covers the limestone floor.  Her soft sighing is the only sound that disturbs the nighttime quiet of the library's entryway."
