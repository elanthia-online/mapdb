      "A wide wooden stairwell begins at the end of the second floor hall, an open banister overlooking the entranceway below.  To the south, a bookcase can be glimpsed through an archway, which stands opposite of a plain wooden door.  A narrow window provides an angled view of the city streets beyond."
