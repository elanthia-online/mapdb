      "Grand cottages have been erected along the borders of the glade.  They quite obviously belong to the rich or noble, such is the quality of their construction.  People stroll along a cobblestone walkway that proceeds north and east.  Lining the walkway, split log benches offer a comfortable resting spot from which to enjoy the soothing drone of the river.  At the center of the clearing, a carved wooden statue of a water sprite stares back at you."
