      "This broad, gravel wash has been scoured by the waters of the Rockspawn River.  A line of driftwood and desiccated water plants entangled in the cottonwoods marks the crest of the river's spring flood.  The currently placid waters of the Rockspawn sweep around a bend here and flow off towards the northwest."
