      "Small and large cottages line the cobblestone street and are surrounded by bright pink dog roses and verdant beach grass.  Wrought iron posts, their lamp's glaesine sides glittering in the day's light, mark the entry to each home.  One end of the street empties out into a central plaza, while the other culminates in a tiny cemetery ringed by a simple white picket fence.",
