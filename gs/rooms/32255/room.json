      "It is difficult to tell if the beads of liquid trailing down the stone wall from where a statue emerges from the structure of the passage itself is blood or water merely tinged sanguine by the ever-constant glare of crimson light from below.  The carved beast is frozen in the act of lunging across the walkway toward the figure that has been chiseled out of the wall itself, likewise arrested in a claw-splayed and snarling rage caught in the midst of realization."
