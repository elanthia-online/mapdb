      "Cozy ebon brocade chairs, draped with acid green knit throws, occupy the spaces between the mismatched bookcases lining the stone walls.  Half-melted candles cast a warm, orangey glow over the webwork silver recipe boxes set beside them on assorted end tables.  Seated on wooden stool, a straw-stuffed scarecrow dons a tilted chef's hat and a black cat-print apron."
