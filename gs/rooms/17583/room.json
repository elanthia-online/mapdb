      "Bejeweled and blinking fireflies drift amongst the various cottages that line the cobblestone street.  Tidy picket fences, each sporting a wrought iron lantern at their gates, separate each home's yard from the other, which causes them to look identical to each other.  The only exception in uniformity is a small store that is built nearest the arch crafted of a seathrak's jawbone."
