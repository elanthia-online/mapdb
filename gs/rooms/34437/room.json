      "Potted plants create an organic fence that almost completely hides the various tents and wagons of the surrounding caravansary, though the prolific growth is arranged to keep the back side of a gaily painted bright yellow wagon and nearby dark alley visible at all times.  Long picnic tables rest along the northeastern section of the yard, their wide oak benches covered in thick cushions, while a large blazing bonfire surrounded by a large stone slab sits in the center.  Off to one side, a mesh-covered rain barrel sits beside a wrought iron rack filled with tinder and kindling."
