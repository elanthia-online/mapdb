      "Rows of pews form a half-circle before a raised dais at the southernmost verge of the hall.  They part for a wide crimson runner that travels up a series of steps to a bloodstone altar, atop which sits a shallow bowl and a simple metal knife.  Behind the altar stands the copper statue of a tall, powerfully built krolvin with intense eyes, his arms crosshatched by scars."
