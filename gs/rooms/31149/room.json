      "Descending sharply into a grass-covered plain riddled with divergent game trails, the western wall of granite distinctly arcs downward to meet the sedge-covered ground.  Plump black and red elderberries ripen on several nearby bushes, which also are laden with white star-shaped flowers that have yet to start the transition to fruit.  Cool temperatures prevail here, though the occasional breeze brings a bit of chill from the surrounding mountains into the area."
