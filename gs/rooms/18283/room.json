      "Tangy ocean breezes whip across the stubby grasses dotting the near-barren overlook.  Small pinpoints of light pierce the eddying mist from above, the starlight dancing briefly in the ocean waves.  At the base of the overlook dark shapes interspersed with glints of light can be seen on the water.  Dense and uninviting, the pitch black jungle looms to the east in a stark contrast to the airy coastal cliffs continuing southward.",
      "Vast expanses of ocean and sky meld into the mist that enshrouds the island.  Closer inland, small tidal pools can be seen dotting the beach at the base of the overlook.  Dense and uninviting, the dark jungle looms to the east, a stark contrast to the airy coastal cliffs continuing southward.  Tangy ocean breezes whip across the stubby grass dotting the barren overlook with unusual strength."
