      "As a result of the expansion of the metal encasing this box, scalding steam rises up from the floor through minute cracks.  Red hot lava is visible through the slivered openings in the walls, but does little to distract from the intense, agonizing heat radiating throughout the sauna.  The ripe odor of previous inhabitants assaults the senses, infused in every crevice and cranny of the cramped surroundings."
