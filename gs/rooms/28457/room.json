      "Twin drapes of coppery marbrinus frame the slightly arched doorway, their fluid lengths transitioning perfectly into walls of polished kakore.  Golden blazestar orbs set into bronze filigree sconces pulsate brightly, providing their unique illumination.  The floor is overlaid in a lush carpet of azure, and a heavy pleated curtain of merlot damask leads into the shop."
