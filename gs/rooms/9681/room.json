      "A gilded mirror hangs above an ebonwood table, its only burden is a faceted crystal vase that overflows with an arrangement of pink and yellow roses interspersed with baby's breath.  The sides of the polished white marble floor are visible beneath the plush, powder blue runner that runs the length of the corridor.  Wooden shutters carved in lacy patterns at the end of the corridor allow a minute trace of sunlight into the hallway.",
