      "Blue-green crystalline waters provide a peaceful and tranquil surrounding, stark in contrast to the frigid and frosty conditions high above.  Though dark, an unhindered view of the bed is still visible and showcases the unmatched beauty of underwater flora and its aquatic companions, while miniscule flecks of silvery blue sprinkled across the massive rock walls project thousands of twinkling lights across the water's surface as moonlight flows into the cavern."
