      "Crenellated walls rise imposingly high above the unshorn lawn and create a bit of a windbreak from the gusty coastal breezes.  Holes in the wall are filled with straw, yarn, and other bits of organic material to create bird houses within the structure, though a great many of them have given over to fungus and molds due to the lingering moisture in the area."
