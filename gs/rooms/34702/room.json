      "The tang of bitter iron chokes the air of the temple, which is ablaze with the heat from great rough-edged hearths along the walls.  Shields in a variety of shapes, sizes, and makes hang from the walls over the hearths, reflecting the roaring flames.  Before a shallow set of steps leading northward, a wide basin of crude metal sits beneath a blackened steel chalice.  Red banners arc overhead like sprays of blood, wavering in the air currents awakened by the heat."
