      "The walls of the corridor have been painted with a wintery mountain scene, the area covered with various creatures sharing space upon the white-inked fields.  Mammoths and snow leopards sit huddled on opposite ends of the walls, leaving yetis, rams, and caribou to populate the middle and bottom of the paintings."
