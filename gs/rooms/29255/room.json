      "Scattered patches of verdigris mar the surface of an old, full-length copper mirror that rests against the eastern wall, its greenish markings resembling a form of abstract artwork.  Broken slats from a teak deck chair have impaled the walls at various heights, their waterlogged surfaces housing dozens of brightly burning votives."
