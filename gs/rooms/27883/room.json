      "The broad sweep of the oak floor is interrupted by an open-mawed greater vruul statue.  Halfway to the beam ceiling, a round mithril-framed window hangs on one of the varnished ebonwood walls.  Some mithril-braced shelves is pushed to the back of the shop.",
      "Under a vaulted stone ceiling, splotches of dye, melted metal and remnants from sheath patterns sully the otherwise pristine and expansive stone floor.  Directly below a crudely painted armored fly rampant on one of the smooth rock walls sits a hefty stone workbench, piled with various items for sale.  A huge pile of vruul skins sits next to a veniom-braced mithril rack, which acts as a secondary display for wares."
