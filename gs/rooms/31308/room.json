      "Strung around the planked walls on rusty chains, repurposed wine bottles softly illuminate the cozy space with a flickering glow.  A splintered padauk door with broken hinges lies across a stack of wooden crates and displays a hodgepodge of wares.  Smooth river rocks weigh down a painted terracotta pot that houses a charred tree limb tilted precariously to one side.  Its blackened, jewelry-draped branches brush against a patchwork curtain, fringed in cowrie shells, bissecting the wagon."
