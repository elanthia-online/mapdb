      "Soft floral scents linger in the air, bestowed by the bouquets perched at the peaks of the scalloped ribbon garland that decorates the upper reaches of the pavilion's walls.  On opposing sides of the space are a high shelf and a low shelf on one side and a small round table on the other.  A central display sits at the heart of the area, lit warmly by the diamond-shaped glass lanterns that hang above, with a pastel blue parchment sign in a simple silver frame set amongst its wares."
