      "Slipping past the limestone pillars in the west and east, the corridor is lined in stained glass windows that paint the marble walls and floor in prismatic colors.  An arched ceiling composed of bas-relief filigree patterns covers the corridor, the filigree designs converging upon the chained anchors of pendant lanterns.  Decorative linden benches rest within the pooled light that spills from above."
