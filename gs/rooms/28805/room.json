      "This area has been converted into a storeroom of sorts and contains row upon row of wooden shelves lashed to stone walls.  The strong mineral odor of the surrounding walls and floor does not quite overpower the persistent scent of herbs and spices that emanate from a wall-mounted drying rack.  A few burlap bags half-filled with grain remain on one of the shelves.  Empty barrels dot each corner of the room.",
      "Uneven wooden shelves are stacked with bouquets of dried flowers, some of the flora decaying slightly between bits of soft moss.  The surrounding walls are roughly covered in old fraying tapestries, their ropes swaying precariously against a wall-mounted drying rack.  Burlap bags full of coffee beans, painted with rudimentary lettering, threaten to spill over the shelving creaking slightly towards its demise."
