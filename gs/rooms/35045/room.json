      "A jagged precipice of blackened rock curves out over the seething flats below like a crooked talon.  The vantage it provides looks out over the blasted terrain, through gas clouds and smoke, toward a twisted mountain in the distance.  Veins of lava stream down its broken summit, which belches black smoke in a constant, choking stream."
