      "Surrounded by logs hewn to a point, the parapet stretches from the nearby tower to the top of the colony's gates in the west.  Bamboo torches fitfully burn from their perch along the southern railings that overlook muddy tracks below, while small barrels filled with arrows and bolts rest beneath.  A fortified door provides entry to a tower that casts shadows upon the stockade fence."
