      "Filtering through the skylight above, beams of pale light illuminate the small area inside the wagon.  Draped over the rafter above, bundles of colorful feathers swing to and fro.  Some shelves hang above a narrow wooden table, its surface covered with bits of leaves and flower petals.  Strands of ivy climb down a small painted door from a narrow box tacked to its surface."
