      "Tinged with layers of dust, the walls of the small hall still display their proud, dark green hues, while the slender towers that are built into the southeastern and northeastern corners also maintain a modicum of their black enamel.  Each tower has decorative crenellations at its peak, while their bases are fitted with iron-barred doors of slightly warped oak."
