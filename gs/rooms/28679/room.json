      "Surrounded by a short wall of stone topped with decorative wrought iron, an eerie grey-green fog rolls through a boneyard frozen in eternal autumn.  Branches of shade trees cast strange shadows over a collection of scattered stone benches, yet seem to avoid disturbing the stillness of the graves.  A small seating area which contains an ornately carved stone table is visible in the moonlight.  Beneath a great oak tree rests a handful of carved pumpkins and a lone grave."
