      "Mirroring mosaics flank the hallway, the eastern one, which depicts a cracked white skull on a field of black, giving way to an arch leading into a shadowed chamber.  Its mate portrays a hand wielding a glinting steel dagger and is made from glass tesserae dyed in a variety of hues.  Runners of black wool with an ivory fringe proceed north toward an altar."
