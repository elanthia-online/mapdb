      "Ivy-draped bars of blackened iron frame the room-wide ebony counter, the wooden surface carved with an expansive map of the eastern seaboard, then covered in a thin sheet of glass.  Behind the counter reveals tall shelves filled with leather-bound ledgers interspersed with obscure trinkets, the treasures barely concealed beneath the lids of small, velvet-lined chests.  A nielira-carved plaque is affixed to the back wall, the creature's long arms serving as a makeshift rack for several faenor keyrings."
