      "Raised several steps above the ground, the sturdily constructed stands overlook a deeply rutted racing track.  Several of the benches have collapsed under the collective weight of the crowds, the splintered oak boards now only fit for kindling.  Strands of embroidered black-on-crimson pennants line the steps leading down to the racing entries."
