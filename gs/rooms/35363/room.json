      "Offering a view of the sprawling coastline, the stone-paved veranda is surrounded by a low wall of red-tipped photinia.  Terracotta urns rest against the wall, providing a vibrant contrast to the russet-hued foliage.  Positioned at an angle to each other, a pair of cobalt blue wicker chairs are set before a wide glass window built into the face of the inn, their seats covered in bright white cushions."
