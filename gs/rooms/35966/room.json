      "Polished dark wood paneling showcasing intricate moldings is paired with rosette-stenciled buttercream wallpaper along the passage.  At regular intervals, winged leather armchairs provide resting spots amid potted wraith ferns.  A gracefully winding staircase of rich mahogany rises at one end, its banister carved with floral motifs."
