      "A small pool of water has collected in a depression upon the ground, a thick root hanging from the ceiling dripping water into it constantly.  The narrow walls descend to meet the floor in a sharp angle, their surfaces smooth and featureless except for the occasional small rock or root breaking the monotony of packed earth."
