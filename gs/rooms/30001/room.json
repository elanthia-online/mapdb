      "Rising high into the sky, carved cloak unfurled in the breeze, a great stone statue stands grim watch over the death and decay that has consumed the village.  Chunks of its disembodied arms lay amidst the dry red embergrass and fresh-fallen snowbanks.  Before the statue is the cool remnants of a bonfire, with shattered earthenware and spilled blood the only hints to the grotesque bacchanals that must have transpired in its warmth."
