      "Steps hewn out of the natural rock underfoot rise toward a cylindrical chamber with a high ceiling shot through with veins of pyrite.  A heavily gilded triptych painted with laquer adorns the wall behind an ornate altar of tawny marble.  Lithe golden figures support the altar, wrought musculatures bunching as if beneath its weight."
