    "description": [
      "At the crest of the ridge stands a dome-roofed cedar gazebo festooned with garlands of russet and amber ribbons and a posy of fall leaves at the peak of each shallow scallop.  Some cedar benches line the circumference of the interior, and diamond-shaped paper lanterns are artfully draped from the ceiling, their crimson, auburn, and saffron shades offering warm light and a welcoming atmosphere.  Beyond the railing of the gazebo, the sky is dark and the view expansive, but no less striking for its tenebrous countenance."
