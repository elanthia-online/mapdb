      "Walls covered in a faint dusting of lichen, the tunnel narrows slightly as it divides in two.  The larger tunnel continues to the north, while a smaller branch veers west.  A slight, almost imperceptible breeze comes from the direction of the larger tunnel.  Along the walls, a string of torches disappears around both bends of the tunnel.  Visible to the south is a tunnel entrance which opens into a larger cavern with a shaft of light coming from the ceiling."
