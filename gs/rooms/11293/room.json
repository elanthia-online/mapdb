      "Foul-smelling yellow smoke lingers in the air around a fractured stone entryway, hampering sight and breathing alike.  Although the building's walls still stand, hair-fine fracture marks spiderweb the scorched grey stone.  Among the rubble of the former brick walkway, small pieces of dark-veined faenor shimmer faintly in the moonlight.  The spray of hardened metal droplets leads directly to the twisted, half-melted urn imbedded in the ground beneath a dead flaeshornberry bush.",
