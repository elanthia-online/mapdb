      "Small flecks of sawdust float in the air, catching in the ambient light of the smithy.  Cobbled walls, lined with small iron bins full of forging glyphs, form a domed lid atop the cramped space.  Next to an umber velvet curtain, a scarred wooden table hold a small set of woodworking tools, with a small set of discarded wooden blocks piled to one side.",
