      "Perched on the edge of a vast chasm, a few dwellings brave the winds and uncertain terrain to take advantage of a view that would equal any. The moons fill the surrounding valley with their soft light, while pine boughs swaying at the prompting of the breeze frame the panorama with rustic elegance.  Dwellings in this remote aerie are large and rugged, braced by heavy pilings and stone chimneys.  Handrails connect the trail leading from one dwelling to another.",
      "Perched on the edge of a vast chasm, a few dwellings brave the winds and uncertain terrain to take advantage of a view that would equal any.  In the far northern distance, sunlight glints off of the distant towers of Ta'Illistim, while pine boughs swaying at the prompting of the breeze frame the panorama with their rustic elegance.  Dwellings in this remote aerie are large and rugged, braced by heavy pilings and stone chimneys.  Handrails connect the trail leading from one dwelling to another."
