      "Sand gives way to richer earth near the shining verges of the water, which begins not far from the base of a long ramp of hard-packed sand.  The shoreline is dappled in blinding light and stark shadow, the former from the persistant pounding of the sun, and the latter, a blessing from leaning date palms that have sprung forth from the fertile soil.  The trees are stunted little things, whipped at all times by the sere desert wind, but their shadows are cool and deep and welcoming.",
