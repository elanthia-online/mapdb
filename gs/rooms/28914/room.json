      "Sunlight slips past the edges of the high cliff that rises like a sheer wall to the north, the golden rays warming the cobblestone streets of the lane as it dips south but doing little to illuminate the eastern and western tracks.  A large two-story inn seems to be the source of the quiet music that filters through the air, while a sprawling stone-sided complex accounts for the sound of hammering.",
      "Starlight bathes the cobblestone lane in a silver sheen, while dark shadows created by the looming presence of a high cliff vie for dominance.  A large two-story inn to the west lends its hulking form to the battle for darkness by looming over the smaller cottages built along the eastern edge.  Removed from the fight, a southern slip of road leads closer to the ocean and is the home of a sprawling stone-sided complex."
