      "Walls paneled with ancient pinewood frame the low-ceilinged room, which is illuminated by starlight winking in through a large bay window with a fine-grained cedar bench beneath it.  Behind an antique spruce desk equipped with inks, quills, and scrawled papers sits an imposing chair of leather simply adorned with silver studs.  Hanging on the wall above the seat is a mounted rolaren knife affixed to an equally aged modwir board, the sole extraneous decoration to the office."
