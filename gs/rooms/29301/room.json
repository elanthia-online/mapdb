      "Spacious and well-lit by lanterns, the walls of the wagon are covered with wooden paneling lined with lengths of ivory cotton.  Sunlight streams through a large clear crystal dome set into the roof.  A pair of carved mistwood tables are set to one side of the room, while a massive wooden chest sits on the other.  The floor is constructed from sturdy oak that is lacquered to a bright shine, its surface splattered with a rainbow of paint.  On the far side of the wagon, a small area has been sectioned off with a silk-draped archway."
