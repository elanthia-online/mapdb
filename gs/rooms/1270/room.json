      "The pier is long and wide, but is utilized primarily by small rowboats and skiffs used for shallow-water fishing.  The dock is packed with anglers who are busy trying to catch dinner or fish to sell at market.  Splatters and stains on the dock show that the fish caught here are often cleaned here.",
