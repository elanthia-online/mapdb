    "description": [
      "Frothing and roiling on its way toward the sea, the Olbin River splashes at the stony shores of the strath.  Heavy white rocks, some near as large as a full-grown dwarf, have been heaped upon the shores.  Across the wide blue waters, farms and dwellings dot the foothills of the Sleeping Lady Mountains, whose peaks are lost in puffy grey clouds."
