      "Along this shop's timbered walls, bows of all makes and sizes hang like stuffed and mounted hunting trophies.  Feathers, paint splatters, and other evidence of arrow-making lightly litter the creaky wooden floors.  Behind a narrow leather-topped counter, the shop's wide variety of archery-related wares sit on display."
