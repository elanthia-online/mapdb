      "Neatly arranged rows of quilt-covered beds sit flush against the peeling emerald walls, the sleeping arrangements densely enveloped by a shroud of yellowed dust.  Heavy wooden chests lay opened at the foot of each bed, filled with wrinkled pieces of bloodied clothing between the illuminated grimoires, ritual daggers, and vials of dried herbs.  A faded yellow and red box rests upon a single bloodwood stool, the seating encircled by stubs of melted wax dripped across the rune-carved wooden floor."
