      "Canopied carts and wide-walled wagons are parked close to an ebony-washed building affixed with jade-lacquered shutters, their reinforced beds filled with parcels and twine-bound envelopes.  An ivy-draped canopy of bleached driftwood stands opposite the bustling shop, the shaded area filled with cushioned chairs of dark wicker facing the blue-green waters below.  The paved path of cobblestones is painted in renditions of exotic stamps, the trail of labels scattered across the grove-encircled plaza."
