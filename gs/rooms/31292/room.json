      "A half-sphere of underbrush serves as the entrance to a heavily wooded area, with towering trees reaching towards the sky, their branches intertwining in an impressively dense canopy.  A curved trail defined by split logs to either side leads directly to a large gap in the underbrush, with a colorfully painted totem standing to one side."
