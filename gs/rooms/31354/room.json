      "The most prominent feature of this room is the four-poster bed against the wall opposite the door.  Each of its posts reaches almost to the ceiling before joining a rectangular frame that surrounds the bed, from which is draped a series of diaphonous curtains.  A small table is set near the bed, and a large iron-latticed lantern stands in one corner of the room."
