      "Sparkles of charcoal grey ash slowly drift to the ground where they add to the several inches already resting there.  Wafts of steam and hot air, rising from a dark hole in the rock face, cause the ash to swirl and dance tirelessly while incessant vibrations from deep within the mountain send rocks skittering downward and make the footing unsure."
