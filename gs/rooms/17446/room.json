      "Slumped against metal poles, straw-stuffed figures wearing hats that are slightly askew are erected way out in the middle of a pumpkin patch.  Catching the wind, cloaks draped around the scarecrows flutter wildly on the current of air.  Every so often, the hump of some furry broad-backed critter ambles idly in the field before falling out of sight."
