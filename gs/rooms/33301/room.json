      "Art pieces decorate the western sandstone wall of the dining hall, each coming in a variety of shapes, sizes, frames, and mediums, while the opposite wall is filled with stained glass windows.  Frosted orbs dispel the shadows from every corner of the space, offering a bright white glow over the long table draped in emerald green and surrounded by high-backed velveteen chairs.  A double-wide green feldspar archway provides egress to the vestibule, while small doors in the northern wall lead into the kitchens and cooking yard."
