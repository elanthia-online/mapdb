      "Woven from colorful reeds, a circular carpet covers the polished wooden floor.  A wide ceramic canister rests beside a narrow oak archway that is draped in pale blue fabric.  The room is illuminated in warm, pale light by a series of rounded crystal globes that hang from the ceiling.  Stacks of boxes, crates, and trunks are neatly piled behind a tile-inlaid counter, each clearly labeled."
