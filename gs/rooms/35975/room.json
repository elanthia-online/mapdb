      "Ill-lit and cramped, the hut is small but tidy.  An enormous riverstone hearth, surrounded by aging chairs with reed-woven seats, dominates the northern wall, a wrough iron hearth hook anchored beneath its mantle.  Grimy windows gaze unblinkingly into the dark of the forest, the space before them filled with low cabinets, ribbon and reed baskets, and a large soapstone basin.  A low sleeping pallet rests opposite a crooked hoarbeam door, its blankets neatly folded."
