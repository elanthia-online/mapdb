      "A massive glass cabinet filled with pottery and porcelain cookware occupies one wall, too large to remove through the small doorways and also too nice to destroy.  A large oak heirloom table occupies the center of the room, and a glass vase filled with flowers in various shades of blue rests atop it.  These remaining pieces of furniture hint at the room's former purpose as a dining hall."
