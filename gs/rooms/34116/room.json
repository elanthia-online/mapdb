      "Supported by a trio of barkless birch saplings, the conical-topped tent is fashioned of heavy rackhal dyed in bands of cerulean and ebon.  Raw-edged rugs of rakkein with the fleece still attached are scattered about the ground, covering the hardpacked dirt and creating an insulation that keeps the chill of the exterior at bay.  Low rough oak tables near the entry display a variety of wares that are for sale."
