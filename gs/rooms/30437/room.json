    "description": [
      "Saltwater-laden breezes stir the surface of the sea, battling with the easterly current for control of the foamy crest forming in front of the volcanic peaks of Charl's Teeth.  Beneath the pristine surface of the waves, a coral reef pokes up like an orange-pink jungle from the ocean floor.  Clearly visible beneath the remarkably transparent water, the vibrant forest-like cluster of living organisms teams with a generous population of many types of sea creatures."
