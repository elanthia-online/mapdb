      "This room has been reduced to splinters and ash by some awesome force.  Broken glass covers the floor, a ragged tapestry hangs from the wall, and thick boards lie snapped like twigs among the wreckage.  Gazing across the devastation, it slowly dawns on you that this room was untouched by the fire.  Something very powerful did this, or perhaps someone."
