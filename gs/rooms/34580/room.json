      "The polished, black-stoned courtyard beneath your feet is cold and unforgiving, and every step taken echoes loudly against the walls of a dark stone tower.  Stretching endlessly upwards, the tower stands an imposing figure, with only a crumbling granite stairway leading up to a single thick ironwood door sufficing as an entry.  The building cloaks the courtyard in an enveloping shadow, dominating with its eerie presence."
