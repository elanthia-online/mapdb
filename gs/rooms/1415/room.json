      "Black flies cover the dessicated remains of several criminals who ran afoul of the law one too many times.  The stench of death and decay, as well as the ghastly, slack-jawed visages of the eyeless corpses keeps passersby a healthy distance from the gibbets.  Bearing almost as much traffic as the road south across the bridge, although of a decidedly more squalid strain, a well-worn dirt road heads west."
