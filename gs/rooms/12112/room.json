      "Headstones of grey marble seem to grow from the ground, placed in neat rows.  A pall of silence hangs over the graveyard, and not even a breath of wind disturbs the serenity.  Set slightly apart from the rest of the graves is a large black tomb.  Carved upon the face of the stone, in the place reserved for the identity of the departed, is the name \"Elanthia.\""
