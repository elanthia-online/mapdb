      "Sea blue-robed acolytes, their arms laden with waterlogged scrolls, shuffle about while sorting their goods into small niches in the rockface.  Laid out in concentric circles, cerulean tiles wrap around a small pool in the center of the alcove, rippling outwards in a wavelike pattern.  Glass-covered channels guide water in from the hallway, flowing into the pool, only to continue towards a moss-covered opening in the southern wall."
