      "Standing among clumps of wildly tall, arching ferns, the ancient trees that rise up toward the sky all bear char marks.  The thickness of the brush makes it difficult to see in any direction, and it is impossible to tell where the waterline resides.  Echoing through the area, quiet dripping sounds emanate from somewhere on the shore."
