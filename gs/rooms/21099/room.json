      "A lush group of tropical trees encloses the clearing, their verdant leaves bowing gracefully to brush the tops of the ruined stone walls that litter the ground.  A small stream babbles through the mossy ground and feeds a placid pond that rests in the center, its surface glinting in the unwavering sunlight.  A carved stone bench sits in between tropical flowers that bloom in an array of hues, their blossoms a bright contrast to the blackened stone.  Some long stone steps lead out of the ruins, their surfaces worn smooth.",
