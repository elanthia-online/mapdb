    "description": [
      "Closely positioned wooden columns help support the earth and ceiling of the small tunnel.  Carved into the limestone walls, several narrow ledges sport a variety of rings, some sparkling as they catch and reflect the light of two torches that are held upright by crude sconces and burn low in the dim space.  A boulder-cramped passageway creates a dead-end, though a light draft of air sweeps up from the small space beneath it.  Despite the presence of a trapdoor overhead, there are no means by which to climb up through it."
