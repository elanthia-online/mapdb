      "The only source of light in this cramped cell is from a small, oval window with bars.  Pushed against the wall, supporting an overstuffed feather mattress, sits an iron-framed cot.  Clearly visible from beneath the cot is the edge of a tattered manual that is missing its cover.  Locked tightly, a featureless metal door stands between this cubicle and freedom."
