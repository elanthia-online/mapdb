      "Mist hugs the ground, creating tiny clouds that skip across mingling snow-dappled alpine grass and bristle-headed sedge that spreads throughout the area.  Granite walls are barely visible to the north, where the air thickens to a veritable fog of chilly, rolling and tumbling in the air in front of a set of descending natural rock steps.  Opposite, white rock cress climbs the grassy mound amid clumps of half-melted snow, the duo bringing a bit of brightness under the shadow of the nearby mountain peaks."
