      "This secluded spot is concealed both from the clearing to the north and the spring to the south by walls of close-growing bushes.  Ferns thrive in the humid shade of overarching oak trees, their tightly curled fiddleheads as smooth as carved jade against the rough dark tree trunks.  Snatches of conversation and laughter drift in on the breeze, but they seem somehow more distant than they could logically be."
