      "A blackened ironwork spiral staircase descends from a wood-paneled ceiling into this luxurious showroom.  Polished mahogany cases with glass windows stand sentinel around the walls, each well lit with brass sconces.  A rich woven carpet rests along a marble floor on which a small desk and chair sit in the center of the room.  Between two of the cases, a marble arch leads to another well-lit chamber of this basement boutique."
