      "Vast propeller assemblies sprout from the upper deck, crafted from the same pale golvern as its rails and plated hull.  Interspersed between them are a series of cannons wrought from the same metal.  Shot racks lining the decks are laden with solid iron cannonballs.  The racks, like the hoarbeam deck underfoot, are heavily etched with dimly glowing runes.  A pale metal ladder leads to the lower deck."
