      "A natural canopy overhead, formed by the growth of towering trees, creates a perpetual shade.  Devoid of leaves, the boles of two trees are twisted together.  Their branches, eerily like arms, seem to consciously cover the fissure set in the core of its gouged trunk, as if trying to hide a rising scream or stifle a sneeze.  Suspended from the lower branch, a broken wind chime bounces erratically with every gusting breeze."
