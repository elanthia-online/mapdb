      "The Auditorium green room is an area nestled amid the curtains and scenery flats.  Ropes and pulleys hang down from a couple of catwalks overhead that span the expanse of the stage, tantalizingly just on the other side of the heavy aquamarine curtains.  An additional array of ropes is contained in an intricate wooden frame, controlling the curtains.  Their operation appears to be a complex affair, judging from the array of ropes and anchors."
