      "Splashes of soot-like hues decorate the upper edges of the canvas pavilion's walls, the dark smears resembling dirt clouds in a grey sky.  Lower along the off-white wall, grey, black and bright white speckles randomly appear.  Soft incandescent lighting illuminates the brick-hued carpets that line the floor, as well as a simple bookcase lined with art-covered shelves."
