      "Forming crisscrossing patterns in the thick creeping thyme, travertine pavers sinuously wend their away through the promenade and terminate at some curved white marble steps that lead to the tower above.  Splashes of white pink, rose, and lilac blossoms cling to the woolly groundcover, providing colorful interest from cliff face to guardrail before disappearing over the eastern edge.  Severe and utilitarian, a pillar-framed postal exchange house crafted of marble is flanked by a pair of brightly burning lanterns, while window-dotted storefronts dapple the lane."
