      "Near the eastern edge of the common room is a raised dais where a visiting bard or performer might sit.  Only spiders entertain there now, weaving silvery webs that catch the dim light of the abandoned inn.  Just past the dais, an arch heralds a long hallway lined with suites.  The doors are boarded over from the outside."
