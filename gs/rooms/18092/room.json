      "A single wooden table straddles the center of the wagon, flanked on its ends by two metal sconces.  Gauzy scarves are knotted around the sconces, which are capped by metal-shaded lanterns.  Vibrant red rugs cover the planked floor.  Demarcating this space from another further back is a suspended silk tapestry with a long slit down the middle."
