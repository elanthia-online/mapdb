      "The area here is prepped for war.  Weapon racks and armor stands line the room for easy access to grab equipment and go.  Countless cages and cells occupy the room, to harbor whatever is needed to shower Elanthia in fire and brimstone.  Along the southern wall, a large mithril gate is the only means to escape this room."
