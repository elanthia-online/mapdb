      "Waxen candle stubs cling to their sockets in a golden candelabrum like destitute lepers, providing the only stable source of light in the dim studio.  Covered canvases gather in the shadows of the room, most shrouded in velvet.  The burled maple paneling of the floor is coated in a layer of silvery dust.  In the room's center, a portrait is limned in shades of ash rose and dusky gold, the feminine figure within turned away from an ornate gilded steel door in the eastern wall."
