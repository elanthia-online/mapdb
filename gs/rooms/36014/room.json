      "Following an established track bordered by blue-green fescue, the area widens into an arch that cups a long birch-sapling fence along its eastern side.  A juniper-banded amber canvas ger and a wool and hide-latticed ger rest at the apex of the curve, their felt-wrapped backs turned toward a rolling sweep of grasslands where distributaries from Khesta 'Dahl slip away and vanish among tall feathergrass and sheepgrass.  Near the track's bend,  displays a twist of braided reeds hung with smooth lake stones that click softly in the breeze."
