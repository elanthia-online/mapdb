      "Barely tall enough to fit a full-grown giantkin, the arched ceiling is lined with thick beams of varnished acacia.  Pinned, hammered, and haphazardly glued across the walls are flyers, jewelry, gems, and all manner of trinkets.  There is a small pathway between the wagon's front door and the back, and on either side of the pathway are bags full of fabrics, furs, and leathers.  Cleared of clutter, a checkered pull-out desk has a neat display of goods."
