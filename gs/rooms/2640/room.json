      "Currents roil the tepid water, with bits of debris and sand caught in a hectic dance.  Overhead, light filters down in shifting beams, which flicker at the mercy of the water's movement.  A shadowy opening creates a fissure in the rock walls, and below that, the lake descends into darkness."
