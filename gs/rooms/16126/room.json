      "The path is so obscured by jungle foliage that following it requires as much guesswork as woodcraft.  Gigantic leaves droop low over the narrow pathway, ferns and tall jungle grasses intrude from both sides.  Long strands of silky gossamer from tiny wind-traveling spiders are strung throughout the foliage, shining brightly in the moonlight."
