      "Slender oak columns frame this grand entry hall, whose pale granite walls rise the full two stories of the building.  The columns support a second floor gallery, reached by a sweeping staircase and bordered by a heavily carved balustrade from which are hung dozens of banners bearing crests of ancient elven families.  The east and west walls are pierced by tall, lancet-topped leaded glass windows, through which dappled sunlight pours into the hall.",

A trio of gracefully wrought vaalorn chandeliers fills the hall with warm, steady light."
