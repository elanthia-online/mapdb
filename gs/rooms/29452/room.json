      "A long snowy pathway littered with chunks of ice winds its way along the edge of the cove.  Festival workers carrying large ice blocks move hurriedly past and disappear into a narrow gap between two large boulders.  An iron chisel juts out from one of the large rocks and is tilted toward the gap."
