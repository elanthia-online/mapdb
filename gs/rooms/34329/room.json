    "description": [
      "Dark and dank, the perpetual moisture leaves water droplets that glisten and shimmer along the tunnel walls and drip downward, silvery blue lines embellishing the surrounding walls from one end to the other.  Claw-like gouges in the stone walls sever the shiny blue drip lines, especially surrounding a squat opening, and a bespatter of a thick, dark-colored liquid stains the ground.  The tunnel makes an extreme northeast rise toward the exit."
