      "Merchants busy themselves outside their pavilions, drawing large crowds to observe them work on their crafts.  Textiles of vibrant prismatic colors hang from a few posts of the outdoor shops, the fabrics eerily waving in the winds.  The constant clang of a hammer on metal reverberates from behind a large thatch-roofed building, a plume of dark smoke billowing upwards.  Several thin hounds dart about the street, scratching at barrels and pressing noses to the ground, fast on the trail of their next meal."
