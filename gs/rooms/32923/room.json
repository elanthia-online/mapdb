      "Coils of rope lay in tidy bundles upon the decking of the pier, their weight, lengths, and hues varying from thick to thin, short to long, and dusky grey to sun-bleached white.  Polished copper and bronze cleats, tarnished with verdigris due to the salt water, are wrapped with hitching leads that dangle in the water."
