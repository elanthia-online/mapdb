      "Wooden beams support the low roof of the open shelter, their surfaces silvered by wind and time.  Stretching the length of the dwelling, a low and worn wooden bench covered in sheepskins rests beneath the sporadic sway of copper and wrought iron lanterns, offering a place of respite for weary travelers.  Ruts line the earth track beyond the edges of the shelter, where a slender pathway winds through tall grasses rippling in uneven waves, each blade painted in green and yellow hues."
