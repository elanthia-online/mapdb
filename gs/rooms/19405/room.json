      "Gold tapestries adorn the walls, each depicting a lonely stretch of sand.  Potted palms rest on the floor between the tapestries, each pot also equipped with a standing torch, the greenery protected from the flame by amber glass.  Abstract driftwood sculptures stand beside the merchandise on display on low tables placed around the room.  Large gold satin cushions in the center of the cool brown marble floor serve as a quiet place to rest amid the daily hustle and bustle."
