      "Several small puddles are interspersed amongst the muddy trail, the black water within them casting a reflection of the bright sky above.  One pool, particularly larger than the others, swallows up a good portion of the muck and nearly halts all progress further.  A lone cypress log has fallen across the pool, the submerged timber covered in thick, slimy algae.",
