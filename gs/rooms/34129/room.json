      "Bolted to a tree trunk above a stand of hammers, a large piece of wood with names and numbers written in a bold hand serves as a memorial.  Barren of snow and grass, large rocks lined up on the ground mark out lanes that lead up to bald spots on the land enclosed with stones in a circular pattern.  A large 'X' painted in white is at the heart of the ring."
