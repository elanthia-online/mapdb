      "White silk walls surround this small room, made cozy by the soft glow of crystal lanterns from above.  An elegant display of velvet-draped trays show off a variety of mirrors that sparkle in the light.  A sapphire curtain leads to another room, the thick material rippling with the small breezes that enter through the tent's opening."
