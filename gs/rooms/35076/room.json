      "Leering mercenaries with crossbows patrol the yard and entrance of a countinghouse.  The building is virtually a fortress in its own right, with spiraled bars of wrought iron reinforcing every window and archers stationed on the crenellated rooftop.  Carriages with smoked glass windows are hitched to a post out front, suggesting prosperous clientele.  Hanging from a dark stone column in front of the business is a heavy brass sign etched with teetering stacks of coin."
