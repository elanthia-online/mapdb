      "A shallow series of steps mounts a raised dais at the center of the crypt.  Atop it is a carved coffin of old, stained marble, its sides etched with hammer and anvil devices.  Driven into the coffin at an angle is a rusted sword of once-fine make.  A flaking mural on the wall depicts four hands straining for a blade wreathed in a nimbus of light."
