      "Blue and white banners embroidered with rampant mules in cool colors hang over a sumptuous array of dishes and drinks crowding the top of a wide hoarbeam table.  An ice sculpture at the table's center depicts adventurers banding together against an immense winged manticore.  Several chairs are positioned near the buffet, upholstered in pale blue wool and patterned with tiny snowflakes."
