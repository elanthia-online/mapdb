      "Honey oak beams cross the ceiling, providing support for an ovate brass lamp.  A pine plank floor provides steady footing, and the planks travel up one wall interspersed by numerous bronze-framed locked doors, leaving the other glacial ice walls bare.  One of the lockers has been removed for you and set on a sturdy oak shelf."
