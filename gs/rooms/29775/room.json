      "Several potted ferns are scattered around the spacious entryway, and filtered sunlight slants in through tall stained glass windows.  A tiled marble walkway leads out to an expansive terrace.  A matching pair of carefully pruned ficus trees in dark bamboo planters flank a curtained archway.  Painted in bright red and blue, a gnome statue props open a set of ironwood double doors."
