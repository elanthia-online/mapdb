      "Thick moss clings to the trees along the riverbanks, the gnarled trunks and twisted branches obscuring visibility to what lies beyond.  A crude stick figure dressed in burlap swings from a low-hanging willow branch, a black raven perched on its wooden shoulder.  The soothing sounds of flowing water fill the quiet air above the wooded lowland."
