      "Pale blue walls painted the color of a sunlit, tropical sea surround this small room.  The northern wall sports a pair of glass double doors that lead out onto a balcony.  Gauzy linen curtains frame the doorway, the creamy white material complementing the color scheme and alluding to wave caps on the ocean.  A sun-bleached driftwood desk rests against one wall, its matching driftwood chair boasting an aquamarine cushion, while a white mithril chandelier hangs from the ceiling.  Across from the balcony, a pale linden door offers an alternative exit."
