      "A small wooden table, missing a leg, wobbles in the center of the floor.  A dice bowl still sits on top of it, the pips on the cubes inside it nearly worn off from time and use.  Beneath it is a small notebook, covered in dirt and rat footprints.  Two lanterns burn overhead, bright and constant despite having no fuel."
