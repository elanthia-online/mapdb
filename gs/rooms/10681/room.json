    "description": [
      "Two imposing fel columns flank the riverstone pathway as it enters Ravelin from the southwest, the transition denoted by its widening into a broad slate square.  Greenery abounds, all of it kept within the proper bounds of lawn, garden, and container.  A wide hoarbeam sign swings gently in the sunlight between the tops of the two columns, the crest of Ta'Vaalor prominent on each end with one word written in between in flowing elven script.",
