      "The air is thick with the aroma of burnt and cooking meat, mingled with the stench of rotting flesh, all of which originate from a makeshift tent set off to the side of the encampment.  Flies and maggots compete with each other over a grotesque pile of leftovers situated next to the tent flap.  Thick black smoke unfurls from the peak of the tent, adding to the grey haze hanging over the warcamp."
