      "Chatter drifts down from the high balconies of brick buildings to both sides of the lane, the dark shapes of which leave only a narrow strip of daylight overhead.  Sunlight glows tenuously off of horse-drawn stagecoaches that rattle over the cobblestone street, but the sparse pedestrian traffic along the road's edges are consigned to shadow.  The windows of the businesses above a barrister's office are dark and the chambers beyond them shrouded by curtains in lurid reds and other bright, jeweled hues."
