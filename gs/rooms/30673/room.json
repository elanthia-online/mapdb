      "A massive mother-of-pearl sphere has been set halfway into the pentangular floor, which is formed from a fathomless slab of translucent black glaes that reflects the yellow-green light emanating from the clear glaes orbs mounted in each corner of the room.  Black, white and grey marbles intertwine to form the walls in a chaotic display.  Smooth seats with low armrests have been carved directly into the stone."
