    "description": [
      "The edge of the terrace overlooks countless hexagonal chambers of resinous wax that obscure the rolling bedrock of the cavern.  Within, larvae bloat themselves on a rich amber jelly that smells of burnt sugar with an acidic edge, the aroma unusual but not entirely unpleasant, especially when contrasted with the mephitic smokes crawling through the depths.  Many of the chambers are capped with wax, but their silhouetted inhabitants are visible in the light of nearby crystals, which are brightly aglow."
