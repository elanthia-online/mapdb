      "Perched at the apex of the narrow street is a small grey stone house with a slanted roof and a front garden of nightshade, monkshood, columbine, and wood anemone.  Grey and blue stones, mixed with crushed seashells, act as a segue between the solid oak door of the abode and the packed dirt road.  A painted wooden sign, anchored by wrought iron near the peak of the roof, creaks in an ambient breeze."
