      "Pieces of palm fronds and driftwood float atop the water from a nearby landmass, the west coastline visible from this vantage point.  Sheer cliff walls backdrop a well-lit dock, which appears quiet in the night.  A cool breeze blows from the island, the scent a mixture of salt air and something more exotic."
