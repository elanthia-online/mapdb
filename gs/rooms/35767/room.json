      "Silvered by time and the cruel caress of the elements, the expanse of dock is littered with pale sand and strewn with drying leaves from the vines tangling its pilings.  Bright flowers in the colors of a spectacular sunset unfurl along the lengths of the vines.  A few frayed black ropes hang from one of the pilings, swaying like raven locks in the ocean breeze."
