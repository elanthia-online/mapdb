    "description": [
      "This barn is cavernous, but still very well lit via the combination of flickering flames emanating from delicate ivory sconces at regular intervals around the perimeter of the barn, and a discreet smattering of indirect lighting from various windows placed in the ceiling.  The floor underfoot is straw, but it is clean and sweet-smelling, and has been carefully raked to lie flat.  The center of the space contains a large number of chests and crates, each one placed directly across from a stall."
