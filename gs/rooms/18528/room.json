      "Tucked against the fence at the road's edge is a whitewashed building, framed on each side by taller structures.  On the opposite side of the road, a small area has been fenced in to enclose a single russet-hued cow.  The animal is tethered to one of the fence posts, and it wears a pink-checkered bonnet with a bow tied around its neck, a feat that no doubt it did not accomplish alone."
