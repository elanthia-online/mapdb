      "Footprints and faint tracks from tiny man-drawn carts are prevalent through the western and southern tunnels here, avoiding the impossibly narrow tunnel to the north.  A few grains of wheat remain on the floor from where a sack split open, although the marmot paw prints around them suggest the rest of the grain has been eaten."
