      "A narrow, down-sloping corridor travels beneath the city, part of the timbered foundations of the buildings above revealed and heavily braced with iron fittings.  Roughly-hewn granite walls have been blackened in spots, the result of eons of seeping moisture.  Every few paces, small arcosolia form gaps in the solid surface of the stone, some filled with remains of broken amphorae."
