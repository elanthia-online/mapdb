      "Shaded by scraggly alders growing from fissures in the rock face above, an old cairn is nearly buried in snow.  The grasses around it are red and sparse, and only a few small mournblooms are hidden amidst them.  Frozen droplets of water hang like fresh teardrops from the branches of the trees."
