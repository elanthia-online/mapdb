      "Brambles of vivid green paint stretch and coil along the walls of the small sanctuary, unfurling from a slender man limned in pale pigments.  The silk-swathed figure stands possessively behind an ornate altar of carved ivory fashioned in the shapes of acrobatic bodies wreathed in garlands of rose and sweetbriar.  Rose and mournbloom incense intertwine in a dreamy haze, perfuming the air, which is occasionally punctuated by screams from the garden outside a carved alabaster archway."
