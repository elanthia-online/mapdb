      "This room has a purposeful look about it, as if important work was once performed here.  A desk occupies the center of the room, positioned to face a couch and within easy reach of a bookcase.  Resting on the shelves of the bookcase are several sculptures and figurines of wood and metal, all bearing a military theme."
