      "In the dim light provided by a pale blue orb that flickers in and out of existence in the center of the room, it is difficult to make out much of your surroundings.  Unstable stacks of various boxes reach from floor to ceiling, threatening to fall upon those who dare to get too close.  Dilapidated wooden shelves sit empty and line the walls, while a wobbly oak case and a rickety haon table sit nestled against an antiquated and dusty counter; a faded handwritten sign hangs crookedly between them."
