      "Surly-looking cooks conspire to fill the air with the allure of exotic spices and roasting meats at the hallway's end.  Opulently carved wooden seats upholstered in stoutfoot wool sit around tables with semiprecious gemstone tesserae embedded in their surfaces, allowing guild officers the chance to hold court with their crews or compatriots while they dine.  A heavy door forged from adamantine guards the way into the guild's vault."
