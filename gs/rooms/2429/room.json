      "Judging from the time-rounded stones and smooth floor, the saferoom is old, but it is kept free of dust.  Crates and barrels full of preserved foodstuffs are stacked floor to ceiling, filling the air with the sharp odor of brine and more muted hints of dry meat and fish.  A large metal lever protrudes from one wall."
