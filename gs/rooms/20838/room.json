    "description": [
      "This spacious windowless lair has been constructed from unpolished black obsidian to absorb light.  A single miniature griffin-shaped torch is positioned to light the entryway, but little else.  An overwhelming darkness fills the room, providing the illusion of infinite space.  Almost blending into the darkness, an elongated leather couch sits across from a wide ebonwood desk with a tall leather chair.  You also see a small black pit and a small griffin-shaped dart board."
