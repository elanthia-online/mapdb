      "A narrow stream bends through the forest here, its smooth waters a deep silver-blue hue.  Small flashes of red and gold can be seen in the depths of the waters, as the occasional fish comes near the glass like surface.  Periodically, a warm wind stirs through the trees, rustling the dark leaves and creating a cacophony of disembodied whispers."
