      "Here, at the easternmost point of the sylvan encampment, the glade slopes down and away into the thicker surround of trees.  Rising up to break the horizon of branches and leaves is a stacked stone structure, not unlike the framing of a chimney or a tall, narrow doorway.  A curtain of cascading flowers spills down from the peculiar arch's peak, casting long, viney shadows on the ground."
