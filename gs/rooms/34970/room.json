      "The gelid air is filled with the sharp tang of brine, an odor intensified by the heaps of seaweed strewn across the black beach.  Several seals laze on the rocks of an island just off the shore, their barks and brays traveling on the stiff breeze.  Though not especially distant, the intervening waters are violent, cold, and dark."
