      "Smoothly hewn and perfectly circular, the small booth has an incredibly high ceiling which has a single frosted globe dangling from it.  Reddish light swirls throughout the compact space, the motion hypnotic and somewhat disorienting.  Fitted into the smooth stone floor is a series of cobalt circles that form interwoven patterns incised with runes."
