      "Pocked here and there with potholes, the floor of the cavern descends sharply as it turns with the bend of the towering walls.  The niches in the walls are broken by an immense carving of a winged woman inlaid with gold and copper.  Light breaks through a narrow crack in the rock ceiling high above, casting the primitive mosaic in faint luminescence."
