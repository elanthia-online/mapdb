      "Crude wooden busts of various height are arranged along the walls.  Most of the busts are layered with unfinished leathers, while others support partially constructed suits of heavier, steel chain and plate armors.  Krolvin armorers wearing dye-stained clothes work diligently as they move between this workspace and a partition of tanned hides toward the back of the smithy."
