      "An expansive carpeting made of tiny steel links occupies most of the room.  Out of a hole in its center rises a granite pedestal, and along one wall hangs a colorful tapestry depicting a battle scene.  Comfortably out of reach, some bloodied Faendryl armor has been affixed to the ceiling above the pedestal.  On a stone shelf are a pair of elaborate veil iron shackles and a crumpled battle flag."
