      "A vein of lichen-covered granite juts from the earth like an exposed spine at the top of the ridge.  Scraggly spruce trees grow in dense stands at each side of the outcropping, their grey-green needles covering the rocky soil, trapping the rainwater that would otherwise cascade down each slope.  At the side of the trail, a ghostly white owl sits in a tree, its head slowly twisting as it scans the forest for suitable prey.",

High overhead, a lone falcon circles the forest in wide, lazy circles, as it patiently waits for suitable prey."
