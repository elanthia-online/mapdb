    "description": [
      "Painted scenes adorn the walls of the barrow near the entrance, which allows gelid moonlight to filter into the stony surroundings.  The paintings are crude at first, depicting strange nautical settings and scenes of battle and death, but the artistry refines as the images proceed further into the cave.  A scattering of bones clogs the pathway.  Some still have flesh on them, and none have yellowed with age."
