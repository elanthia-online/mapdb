      "A small lean-to on the south side of the tower provides the on-duty guards with some shelter.  You can see the roofs of town buildings to the south and southeast.  To the east you can see two more guard towers, apparently sitting on either side of the river.  To the northwest, you can see the road that leads to the main gate of Wehnimer's and, beyond it, to the shoreline."
