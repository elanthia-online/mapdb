      "A cloud of clove-scented haze lingers over the top of corbeau leather armchairs that are clustered in dimly lit corners.  Wrapping around the lounge, an ornately carved modwir bar topped in a gilded viridian marble is attended to by a sharply dressed bartender.  Rows of velvet-padded stools line the counter, offering a view of the ledge housing bottles of liquid ranging from amber to honey-hued.  Backlit shelves angle downward to display cigar boxes and their contents behind walls of thin glass."
