    "description": [
      "The cramped interior of the farmhouse is made less navigable by an overturned table blocking the way into a ransacked kitchen.  Despite the cold, the smells of spoilage and rot commingle into a revolting melange that hangs on the air like a rancid oil slick.  Some rickety wooden stairs climb past the wreckage, guarded by an unwieldy looking bannister as they ascend to the house's second story."
