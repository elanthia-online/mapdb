      "Trickles of a westward stream cascade down the slope, filling a pool surrounded by white stones with silt, leaves, and other fine detritus.  The pool spreads south and eastward, though its edges are confined by rocks.  A small plank dock juts into its depths, a young boy reclining upon a rhimar chest where a hastily scratched wood sign leans."
