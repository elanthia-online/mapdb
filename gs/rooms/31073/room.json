      "Rough wooden paneling lines the walls of the cabin, the tight knots in the slabs creating natural patterns.  Several wrought iron lanterns hang from the ceiling, shedding a soft light across the room.  Centered on the floor is a thick, wool carpet with a large padded chair resting behind a wide maple desk.  A pair of maps are hung by the door with details of various trails and tracks."
