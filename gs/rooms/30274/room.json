      "At the center of the lofty ceiling overhead is a mosaicked medallion depicting one of the famous airships of Ta'Illistim in flight.  Its silver shape is placed against a background of sapphire blue, the hue of which is echoed in the similarly colored glaes tile floor.  The rectangular room is set on its longer faces with a pair of double doors and a lapis-tiled arch."
