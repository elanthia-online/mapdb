      "The darkness in this wagon is oppressive, and the few light sources struggle to illuminate most of the nooks and crannies.  A dark wardrobe stands open against one wall, and some hanging baskets dangle from the ceiling.  The floor underneath is cloaked in shadow, but creaks slowly whenever there is movement.  Hanging in a particularly shadowy corner is a tattered grey curtain."
