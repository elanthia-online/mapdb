      "Nearly eight yards long from nose to tail, a colossal shark is held aloft by a series of spruce racks outside of a prosperous tavern along the chasm's edge.  The fearsome beast smells of the sea, and its bulk is unmarred save for a harpoon wound in its side.  Ragtag sailors and colorfully dressed captains alike mill in the throng outside the whalebone-inlaid doors.  Ship lanterns hang from heavy brass chains to either side of the entrance, though they are unlit and soot-stained in the cold light of day."
