      "Curving around the atrium, the second floor frames the grand circulation desk below, its presence marked by a tile mosaic in teal, white, and canary yellow.  Towering bookcases stretch toward the vaulted ceiling, their warm wood tones complementing white wrought iron railings.  Lanterns perch atop the posts, casting dappled light across the floor.  Above, staircases spiral toward the next level, their curves forming a clover arch over a quiet reading alcove nestled beneath its embrace."
