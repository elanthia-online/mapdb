      "Here inside the tent, the light wicker frame that provides support is just visible between the wool blankets used to help muffle sound.  A massive apparatus bearing a strong resemblance to a stretching rack is dwarfed only by a device whose purpose seems to involve a great deal of crushing and compacting.  Stuck into the ground is a tall pole marked off at intervals with red paint."
