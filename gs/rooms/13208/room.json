      "Expansive pure white walls supported by tall ivory columns stretch to the east and west, covered with numerous black tapestries trimmed with deep green.  A large marble fountain stands in the center of the room, its soft trickling sounds echoing about you.  Rose petals are scattered liberally across the floor, and the sweet scent of perfumes and oils occasionally drifts in from somewhere nearby."
