      "A multihued Vornavian silk tapestry hangs on one of the refined oak-paneled walls, and a swirl-painted white stucco ceiling rises overhead.  An elegantly dressed maiden statue sits in one corner of the limestone floor.  There is a Vornavian silk-lined display case on one side of the shop and several white marble shelves on the other."
