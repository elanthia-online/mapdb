      "A wide rift disturbs the ground.  It is surrounded by a fringe of broken, icy earth that points angrily at the sky.  No trees grow over the area of the disturbance, leaving the area unprotected from the raging elements.  Heavy snowfall has almost filled the chasm, leaving nary a hint as to its depth or scope, but it appears easily traversible."
