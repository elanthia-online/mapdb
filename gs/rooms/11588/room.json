      "An oak chart table is attached to the port bulkhead, its shallow drawers drawn open by the angle of the ship.  The ship's log is attached to the table by a brass chain.  Charts are strewn about the cabin.  Above the table is a neat row of texts held in place by a slat.  One of the leaded glass stern window has shattered, allowing a salty breeze into the cabin.  A ship's lantern sways in the breeze."
