      "Oil lamps hanging from crossbeams overhead shed warm light down on this spacious shop.  Behind a long black spruce counter that divides the room's workspace and display area is a smooth, ample workbench with a padded stool directly behind it, facing the entry.  Bins full of various materials stand at the ready behind the stool.  On the floor by the far wall, a small cast iron brazier with a hood that directs smoke out through the roof radiates enough heat to fill the entire room.  Various goods hang from hooks in the shop area."
