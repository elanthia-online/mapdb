      "Aisles of tall, cognac mistwood shelves are stocked with a plethora of jars holding a colorful array of herbs, each labeled with the tea blend it contains.  Cutout trestles with shelves of ivory ash sit behind a sales counter, exhibiting tea kettles, cups, and saucers, the items varying in material and brightly painted colors.  Across from the carved white ash door, a moss and flora mural hangs from the back wall of the shop, its plant life lending an earthy smell to the floorspace."
