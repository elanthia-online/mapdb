      "Several large posts are situated at regular intervals along the teak pier, each carved with a striped warcat.  Cork and canvas bumpers pad each docking slip, and the soft sound of waves slapping against wooden support posts fills the air.  A carved driftwood sign reads, \"Foggy Larton Pier - Slips 16-20.\""
