      "Transitioning from cobblestones to knotty oak, the ceiling of the passage is largely hidden in shadows.  Smooth stone walls give way to a wall of packed dirt in the southeast, where a blackened wrought iron ladder disappears through a trapdoor above.  The scent of freshly baked bread mingles oddly with the overall dankness of the area."
