      "Deceivingly larger than expected, this cave is comprised of a sturdy rock ledge with ample room for a few adventurers, a small campfire, and a vast, open space that plummets to the depths below.  Obstructive ice stalactites hang from above and occasionally unite with a twin stalagmite to form an impressive ice column.  Plumes of steam rise from the platform edge and disperse along the ceiling to refreeze and replenish the ceaseless ice formations."
