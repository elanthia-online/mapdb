      "A jagged overhang crested with glittering ice shards is angled in such a manner that it casts a darkened canopy over several shops and wagons falling in its wake.  Slicing through a craggy lower shelf of rock recessed in the northern cliffs, a vivid blue-green channel of color reveals itself to be the feathery boughs of spruce trees peeking out from beneath the alabaster snow."
