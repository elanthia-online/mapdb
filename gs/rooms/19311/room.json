      "The bole of the monstrous willow is surrounded with a wealth of hanging garlands.  They obscure the existence of a small enclave at the base of the tree near some louvered swinging doors, both curtained off by the tiny silver-backed leaves.  Constantly shifting spots of sunlight filtering through the boughs are hypnotic.  High up in the branch system, a circular construction is barely visible encircling the willow's trunk.",
      "The bole of the monstrous willow is surrounded with a wealth of hanging garlands.  They obscure the existence of a small, shadowy enclave at the base of the tree near some louvered swinging doors, both curtained off by the tiny silver-backed leaves.  Soft moonlight filters through the boughs, leaving the silhouette of the branches as stark, black lines.  High up in the tree top, a circular construction is barely visible in the night's cloak of darkness.",
