      "A quartet of veined marble pedestals hold dented bronze statues, each facing a cardinal direction, their faces gouged through in deep furrows from temple to throat.  The dirt beneath each column rises above the edges, the uneven earth tilting each one forward in a slow descent towards a row of empty homes."
