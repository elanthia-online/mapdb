      "A flat plane of stone breaches out of the earthen wall to the north.  Its surface is unusually smooth, as if painstakingly worked by huge hands.  Archaic limnings on its surface stretch many times the height of a man, depicting a glowing woman of gold standing amidst a swarm of black ravens.  The artwork is marred by smears of drying red fluid that appear sourced from a blood-filled sinkhole dominating the cavern floor."
