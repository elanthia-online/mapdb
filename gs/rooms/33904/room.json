      "A fragrant veil of dried herbs and florals drifts across the curtain-draped shop, the sheaves arranged in various glass vases across the fine-grained haon counter along the back wall.  Charcoal-sketched drawings frame tall vertical drawers, the lined containers filled with wax-sealed vials and bottles, each vessel affixed with a tiny vellum tag.  Several bracketed shelves line the sides of the apothecary, filled with wide stone jars interspersed between wicker-woven canisters."
