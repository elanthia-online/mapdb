      "Heavy layers of ruddy felt encircle a round wooden table in the center of this dwelling.  Colorfully painted saplings are bound and formed into rafters from which the felt is stretched and pulled taut into walls and a roof.  A slotted ring, carved from the adjoined tusks of a large creature, supports the rafters and binds the top of the structure."
