      "Dark shades of indigo and grey dapple the floor of this room, with the vague outline of buildings and trees rising from the base of the walls to reach toward a sky that is inky black and dotted with stars.  The sliver of a crescent moon hangs in one corner of the room, and pale silver paint outlines the dark forms that line the room, with chiseled shelves with a few golden hooks beneath found imbedded in the shapes of the houses and buildings."
