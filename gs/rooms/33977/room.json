      "This spacious glade has numerous benches set near stone circles with a prominent circle for a bonfire at the center.  Placed at strategic locations throughout are barrels of leaves, log-filled racks, and twig-stuffed crates.  Wild roses and blackberries grow along the clearing's outskirts, holding voracious vegetation at bay.  A shadowed vine-beset footpath disappears into the verdant darkness, while to the east, a manor is visible in the distance near what looks to be the remnants of a decepit ferris wheel."
