      "The street runs along the edge of a large, well-tended rock garden.  Massive boulders, tiny pebbles and all sizes of rocks in between are piled up in interesting shapes.  Dwarves wander about amongst them, pausing to admire one mound or another.  The garden extends several hundred feet to the north, ending at the town walls.  The River Muagh lies just to the west.  One family has set up a picnic on the river bank.",
