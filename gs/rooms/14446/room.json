      "A brass-framed painting depicting a shark swimming through the ocean's depths is hung on the wall of this small booth.  Several gold-hued fish border the edges of the quaint little table set between the two benches of the booth, though some have been pried off as evident by the fish-shaped outlines punctuating the oddly-numbered patterns.  Two oil lamps are suspended from the edge of the small booth to impart ample light upon the area."
