    "description": [
      "Sheltered in the heart of town and amidst a grove of trees, this earthy structure beckons visitors with an intricately carved pair of oak doors.  Hand-stripped logs of age-darkened oak are carefully placed to form the circular walls.  Two smaller outbuildings are visible around the circumference, their rounded exteriors radiating outward to match the arc of the main structure.  The triskelion architecture of the lodge is clearly discernable in the lichen-covered riverstone foundation."
