    ],
    "description": [
      "The wide, sloping strath cradling the rushing waters of the Olbin is shielded from the worst of the wind and cold by the smallest sisters of the Sleeping Lady mountains in the north and high hills in the south.  Here and there, hardy greens peek from amidst the snowbanks, with even a few wildflowers brightly announcing their presence.  A roadway has been worn into the cold earth, beginning at an ice-slicked ridge climbing toward a pair of hillocks and lazing westward through the valley's meadows and farmland."
