      "The tunnel leads you back into a small room with many exits.  This appears to be a central area where the inhabitants gather to prepare and eat their meals.  A ring of stones surrounds a large fire with several cooking utensils resting against one of the stones.  Two long tables surrounded by several stools show many stains from previous meals.  A third table is set about ten feet from the fire and has several items on it."
