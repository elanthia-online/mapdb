      "Massive dandelion puffs float against the twilit sky, swaying in a persistent breeze atop long stalks stemming from rosettes of lobed, lanceolate leaves.  Sent aloft by sporadic gusts, fuzzy seeds whip through the air until the wind settles, allowing them to drift to the earth.  Radiant orbs hover among the tufts as they fall like whiskery snowflakes, bathing the fluff-blanketed ground in honey-hued light."
