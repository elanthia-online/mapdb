      "Bright blue and green, Elanthia sits poised over the northern edge of Liabo's horizon and displays its entire southern continent.  The bright glow of the planet erases all other lights and colors from the area, its luminosity even eclipsing the starlight to the east and west of its swollen form.  Golden tiles imbedded into the dusty white ground take on an azure hue that darkens where they encircle a glass-lined ring."
