      "Woven twigs and dark green vines splotched with blood-red blight form the pliant walls of the longhouse.  It is difficult to tell if supporting stone lurks somewhere beneath, or if the writhing, rasping greenery is all that separates indoors from out.  Crooked candles, their wax the color of old bones, glare from nooks in the living walls, sullen candleflames dangerously close to dangling vines.  Other crannies house censers leaking cloying, heady smoke.",
