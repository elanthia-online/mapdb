      "A raised wooden dais stands in the middle of the clearing, with a circular path all around it.  The platform itself is painted a deep forest green, the hue almost a perfect match for the surrounding grasses.  A number of paths lead away from the clearing, each one framed by split logs, while to the north a wooden archway is guarded by a pair of stern-faced Iyo."
