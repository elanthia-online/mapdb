      "The mosaic-tiled floor of the room creates a map of the western waterways, the various seaports highlighted in metallic ink and scrimshaw ivory, whilst nautical routes are traced in blue-green imflass.  Vellum-sailed boats are scattered across the ground, a few strategically lined to flank a merchant ship far from port, the fleet surrounding the tall mahogany bed that dominates the far wall.  A gilt-framed velvet armchair sits by a ceiling-high window, the seat draped in layers of plush fur."
