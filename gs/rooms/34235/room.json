      "Viscous fluid oozes slowly down a slick stone chute with walls too even to be entirely natural in make, the slippery stone ascending into the rock of the ceiling.  Nearby, alcoves within the walls are sealed with clouded resin reminiscent of amber, though its predominant ochre hue is tinged with mauve occlusions.  A murky form is trapped in each, recognizably humanoid despite the poor visibility.  The air is warm and damp, and it seethes by in sluggish breaths."
