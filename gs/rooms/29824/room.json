      "Simply assembled planks of black oak and limestone compose the outer structure for the fairly spacious dwelling.  Dusty iron lanterns hang from the four cobweb-strewn corners of the squared space, emanating with a dreary, wavering glow that spreads over a high-backed aged teak chest and a rough-hewn white cedar rack.  Arranged at the back, a splintered mistwood case is bookended by a heap of discarded whittling tools and haphazard curls of lumber scraps."
