      "A pair of broken granite pillars stand just to the north, their misshapen and lichen-encrusted forms looming above the eddies of silver mist.  The piles of crumbled stone between the pillars hint that they were once the supports of some ancient arch.  The desolate, blackened ground almost feels unsteady, as if it were groaning soundlessly with the force of some ancient, hidden evil."
