    "description": [
      "Cramped and dusty, the storeroom is essentially just a corner of the tiny hovel separated from the rest by a bead and bone curtain.  It houses a black willow desk with a mud-dotted grey stone case shoved underneath, and a single twisted candestick in a tarnished silver sconce illuminates a scrap of rough vellum.  Mithril shavings, straw, and dozens of straggly chicken feathers pile together in clumps scattered across the area, a tiny errant bone or talisman visible here and there."
