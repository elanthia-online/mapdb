      "Standing stones, some monolithic giants, act as quiet sentinels to the entrance of a court cairn at the northernmost edge of the twining trail, the ground slowly transitioning from a rock-riddled landscape covered in moss to bristly grasses ranging in hue from yellow to pale green.  Wild gorse grows in clusters against the highwalls of the barrow along the western edge of the track, while fields of Asharikan lilies surround winding pathways to thatch-roofed dwellings."
