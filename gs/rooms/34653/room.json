      "Blossoming flaeshorn vines climb the walls of a marble enchanter's atelier.  Intricate symbols have been carved into the dark stone, following the natural crimson veins that travel through the marble in a way that makes them difficult to follow with the eye.  Carved steps lead up to a heavy, reinforced door.  Windows of stained glass--bold cobalt, vibrant cardinal red, and rich burnt umber--give not a hint as to the workshop's interior, but their panes shine as if lit from within."
