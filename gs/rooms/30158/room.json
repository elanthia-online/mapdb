      "An oblong semicircle of silver-streaked black granite steps descends inward toward a grandiose, open-air, polished obsidian stage.  Encompassing the predominant platform is a horseshoe-shaped, shallow dry moat lined with a series of evenly spaced dark lanterns and sanded lor rampways at either end.  Along the posterior of the stage, an ornate widowwood rostrum rests at the midpoint of a vast, crescent-shaped marble wall that serves to reflect and amplify the surrounding acoustics.",
