      "A dark stone tower looms majestically in the center of a large clearing, rising high above the trees.   Its ebon stonework contrasting against the forest's lush greenery.  Blackened trees ring the outer courtyard, their trunks warped and twisted into a menacing tribute.  A large marble statue stands guard to a polished black flagstone path that leads through a decrepit courtyard."
