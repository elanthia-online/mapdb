      "Growing with wild abandon, firewitch dianthus brightens the alpine tundra with shocks of vibrant pink.  Backed by a rock-dotted slope lush with grasses and cushions of moss campion, short brass braziers warm the tigerwood pavilions at the base of the northerly hillock.  Long swaths of shimmering, richly dyed silk, veiled in ebon lacebark, drape from the ornately carved frames and undulate like water under the constant coercion of crisp breezes."
