      "Perched upon a barren hill surrounded by large stone outcroppings, a hovel of stone and slate rests half in shadows and sunlight.  A white birch door provides entry to the small structure and is flanked by stained glass windows that are cheery to the otherwise austere surroundings.  Flying high and proud, a banner of chocolate brown flutters in the alpine breeze.",
