      "In the light radiated by a luminescent toadstool growing from a polished brass pot in the corner, polished brass fixtures gleam against the alcove's white marble walls, ceiling, and floor.  A gilded sign has been affixed beside a brass-barred window.  Well-dressed dwarven patrons wander into the alcove to conduct transactions with leather-bound portfolios and registers."
