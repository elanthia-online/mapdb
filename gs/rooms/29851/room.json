      "The small tent holds the faint odor of acidic rain, and pale yellow hazy smoke curls up from a talon-shaped lantern positioned directly in the center of the room.  A circular, dark oak table is covered with tattered, blue vulture feathers and various walking sticks.  Suspended from the pavilion's center pillar are a series of stained hooks that perch over a battered wooden vanity.  Several patchwork bear hide rugs surround a small glaes display case."
