      "Partition walls curve to form a short hallway on the western side, their felt coverings banded with narrow blue geometric patterns.  Beyond the passage, a compact sitting area opens on a rug woven in cool tones of deep blue and white.  Thick round cushions in matching hues ring a low round table of dark-stained birch, where a shallow wooden dish rests filled with small morsels set out for visitors."
