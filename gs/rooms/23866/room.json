      "A cluster of rosewood trees grows here, growing so close together as to create a tangled mass of branches that seems to meld into one gigantic tree.  Winding around the massive trunk is a thin trail that leads through the underbrush towards a clearing.  The faint scent of wood smoke lingers in the area, and a layer of mist clings to the spongy ground."
