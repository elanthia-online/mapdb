      "Taller than it is wide, the lofty shop is papered in a golden cream damask pattern that leads to a broad oval-shaped mirror that dominates the back wall.  A few paces back from the looking glass, a solitary dark acacia case sits atop a lush burgundy wool rug and is illuminated from within to better display the wares inside.  Hanging from the ceiling, a round crystalline chandelier glints iridescent patterns throughout the shop when touched by ambient light."
