      "Glimmers of amber light dance along the tunnel mouth to to the northeast, highlighting the deep gouges that mar the stone.  Rough prisms of ametrine embedded in the walls throw violet and gold sparks back at the intrusive illumination.  The broad corridor dug through the granite follows a pronounced curve as it winds, arcing progressively upward, to the southeast."
