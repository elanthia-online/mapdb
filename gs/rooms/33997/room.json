      "The easterly hall stretches several yards, with numerous doors and entryways along each side.  Old paintings are draped with cobweb-covered black cloth, and at the far east end, the glass of a massive window has been painted black.  Just beneath the window sits a merry-go-round figurine.  Midway down the hall is a cherrywood arch remarkably free of dust, cobwebs, or signs of aging."
