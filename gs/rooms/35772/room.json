      "Dense clusters of heliconia and bird of paradise fill the area with sweeping fronds and vivid color.  A pale path of seashells winds between the plants, its curve leading toward a bluestone cottage.  A driftwood post supports a polished brass lantern with blue-tinted glass, its frame worked into the shape of curling fronds.  Tall palm trees rise in even rows beyond a copper-roofed quaint stone residence."
