      "The smell of paint, both fresh and old, is almost overwhelming, and the scuffed hardwood floor creaks under each footfall.  Dim lighting reveals old paint cans stacked in one corner and highlights the nondescript, flat grey walls whose only feature is the myriad painted phrases scattered here and there.  One small door leads back out and another deeper into the performers' area."
