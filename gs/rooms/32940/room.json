      "Heavy boards are hammered over the support beams of the shop's haphazardly furbished walls, nearly unsuitable to support the weight of the unlit, ornate copper sconces affixed to them.  Cloaks, capes, and jackets hang from pegs jutting from a pair of freestanding wooden poles to either side of an ironwood order counter.  Standing attentive behind the counter is a balding human man wearing lavish crimson silks and dark leathers."
