      "Multipaned circular windows dot the front wall, allowing fragmented beams of sunlight into the cozy but otherwise dimly lit shop.  Dozens of woven seagrass bee skeps dangle overhead, interspersed with ribbon-tied bundles of dried herbs.  Opposite the entrance, a high, slat-sided acacia counter blocks access into a rear doorway, but myriad rhimar-lined boxes and woven baskets can be glimpsed through the long, beaded strands curtaining it."
