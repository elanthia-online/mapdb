      "The table, a plank of pale driftwood with a wavering edge, bears faint turquoise veins like rivulets of clear blue water.  Scrawls of carved graffiti left behind by past diners mar its surface, which is otherwise unadorned.  Benches of bleached oak sit to either side, held together by copper studs that gleam warmly in the lamplight.  A cluster of sea-foam green mugs rest at the table's center, empty but only questionably clean."
