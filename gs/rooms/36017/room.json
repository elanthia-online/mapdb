      "To the south, the grasslands roll away in a wide stretch that spreads through the valley, while to the far east beyond the village's edge, the dark stain of woods rises from the mists of Khesta 'Dahl.  Domiciles dot the track, their entries turned toward a pasture where brindled sheep, stoutfoot roltons, and Saens Valaire goats roam.  Patches of caribou moss spread across the ground in pale green cushions, their rounded forms marking where the soil grows thin."
