      "Widening into a quiet, enclosed space, the walls of the cavern curve gently inward.  Bands of soft coral line the stone, broken by tufts of gently swaying weed.  A smooth shell-encrusted bench rests near the back, its surface worn and rounded with age.  Above, the ceiling arches unevenly, crusted with brittle sponge.  Across a natural opening, a trailing curtain of pale kelp drifts in long, slow ribbons, shifting with the still water."
