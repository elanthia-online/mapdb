      "Swaying in the seaborne breeze, a sturdy rope and oak catwalk connects the mainland to the small island and is flanked by a pair of dormant torches.  Unkempt grass is divided by a thin dirt track that wends its way towards the stony steps of a brick and mortar lighthouse, while a white picket fence encircles the perimeter to create a safety barrier from treacherous footing at the edge of the cliff."
