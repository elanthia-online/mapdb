      "A mural of a forest scene, with thick trunks spaced close together, covers all four walls, lending itself to the primordial ambiance of the room.  A thick grass green rug covers the floor, its expansive surface interrupted by a replica wooden obelisk and a weatherbeaten sign.  On one wall a panoramic painting in a knotty oak frame blocks the mural of trees behind it and resting below the artwork is a glass-fronted oak case."
