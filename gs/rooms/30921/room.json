      "The thick jungle growth is held at bay by a huge banyan tree, its trunk a wall of smaller boles all melded into the one tree.  Ferns sprout around its foot and orchids create a riot of color, clinging to crevices in the tree's branches with their curling roots.  A thick wall of buttress roots shields the tree, preventing a close approach to it."
