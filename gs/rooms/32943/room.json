      "Pin-tailed sandgrouse warble to one another as they wander within and out of the shade provided by yellow-flowered gopher plants that grow in scattered profusion amid the bright white stones of the garden.  A singular path trails between the cobblestones of Trisister Road and a small shrine of white marble.  Lining the ambling way, small succulents of coral-edged green, crimson, and russet hues provide a splash of interest against the smooth stones."
