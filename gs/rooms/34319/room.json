      "Overhead, a thick metal cable can occasionally be seen through the thick puffy clouds, and a massive wall of boulders to the west blocks further travel in that direction.  Heaps of griffin droppings and unending puddles of mud make for challenging foot travel, though frequent stones and rocks provide a slightly elevated pathway for avoiding mishaps despite its equally troublesome attributes.  Rotten logs are both imbedded between rocks and boulders as well as strewn across the ground."
