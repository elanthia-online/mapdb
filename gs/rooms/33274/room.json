      "The rich paneling of the room is fashioned from spalted maple, each cornered with a niche radius display of fancy chopines.  A sturdy U-shaped worktable meets against the back wall with an oversized steel-banded barrel tucked underneath.  Just above the table is an organized tool rack with countless pieces of cobbling equipment.  Hanging from the ceiling is modest iron chandelier cast with tiny daisies."
