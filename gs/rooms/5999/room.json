      "A vacant and dust-strewn yard surrounds the burnt foundation of an old farmhouse, its earthen expanse quickly dwindling under the onslaught of rugged grass.  The outer walls and roof of the house have long since vanished, victims of the fire that gutted the structure or of the elements which have ravaged it in recent years.  A few scorched wooden steps provide access to the open interior of the ruin."
