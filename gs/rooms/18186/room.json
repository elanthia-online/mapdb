      "You are in a natural cave of the mountain.  The walls are coated with a glowing fungus providing significant lighting.  Bubbling in one corner is a small pool fed by a hot spring.  The water quickly wanders across the chamber floor in a shallow stream and then vanishes into an opening on the west wall."
