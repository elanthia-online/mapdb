      "A perpetual twilight reigns beneath the canopies of oak and ash trees aflame with crimson and amber leaves.  Tufts of long-stemmed, cider-hued wisp lanterns glow softly from the base of every other post in the split rail fence lining the path, supplementing the middling light to guide the way.  The trailing run of water has widened into a small stream, carrying on its surface fallen leaves rather than being diverted by them."
