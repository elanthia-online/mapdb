      "The mud-covered road is flanked by twin plank-affixed structures built high upon the winding hill, the small boxes left unkempt as dozens of bats swoop in and out of the torn wire enclosures.  A third house lays horizontally in the tall grasses beside a large home, the broken gaps allowing small rodents to slip and out in search of food."
