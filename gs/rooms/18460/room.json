      "A fence borders the road that stretches from the meadow and deeper into town, separating the hard-packed dirt rutted with wagon trails from the verdant fields that lie beyond.  With little regard for the wildflowers or the picturesque quality of the landscape, a roan cow plucks clump after clump of grass from the ground, chewing with a slow, purposeful disregard."
