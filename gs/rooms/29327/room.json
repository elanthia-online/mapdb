      "Opposite the entrance, wallpaper patterned with draping tree branches is interrupted at irregularly spaced intervals by a plethora of polished silver hooks, most laden with a bag, pouch, sack, or other container like a ripening fruit.  A trompe l'oeil sky peeks through painted apple tree branches overhead, with clusters of tiny glowing spheres of frosted glass dotting the ceiling to mimic shafts of sunlight.  Unseen, a music box plays the tinkling notes of a drowsy aubade."
