    "description": [
      "Bright white wrought iron railings curve around the edge of the cliff to create a protective barrier that prevents visitors to the island from tumbling over into the rocky shoals below.  Benches surrounded by brass lanterns rests against the contour of the railing and provide a comfortable space to recline around an enormous bonfire.  Public baking stoves and cutting boards are arranged along the eastern edge of the clearing."
