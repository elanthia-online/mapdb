    "description": [
      "The trail winds across a narrow ridge of stony ground, threading through a patch of spiny gorse that threatens to shred both clothing or skin at the slightest misstep.  The chill wind whistles through the spiked branches, blowing waves of silvery mist down from the dark moors to the north."
