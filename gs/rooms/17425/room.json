      "Glistening stained crystal windows ring the room, casting small pools of crimson-tinged moonlight amidst larger, brighter ones unsullied by intruding hues.  Walls of alabaster are polished to a white-golden shine, their surfaces nigh as smooth as the slabs of mirror-finished marble that comprise the floor.  Beneath a tall red-lacquered arch, the sinuous rise of a long stairway begins, sprouting as if something organic from the curved walls as it rises."
