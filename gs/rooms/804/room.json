      "A pool of rock-cress surrounds some thinly spaced fir trees on the sloping mountainside.  Years of travel have worn a path through the grass and hardened the rocky soil beneath.  With only the testimony of your footfalls to judge by, you might imagine yourself walking across a flagstone-paved street."
