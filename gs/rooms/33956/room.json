      "Though peeling, the wallpaper on the walls is without stain or blemish, and the floor is scuffed as if with the movement of furniture and bears, near the door, the wispy-fingered stains of soot left by flames.  A single window hangs in the side wall, its glass smoked grey.  An elevated ebonwood display sits beneath it, along with a sectional filigreed silver case, and both are lit by a cream-shaded oil lamp."
