    "description": [
      "Cold and crystal clear, a small lake has formed at the peak of the hill, providing a popular spot for local wildlife to congregate.  A huge colony of penguins flourishes on the shores of the lake.  They waddle comically around the edge, preen themselves and one another, and dive after little silvery fish darting through the frigid waters.  A smooth runnel in the bank makes an ideal slide for the creatures and, it appears, some of the younger townsfolk.",
