      "Burnished wooden planks curve out to form the massive hall of the tavern's entrance, with rows of sturdy oaken posts rising to connect with a network of rafters above.  Dozens of blackened oil lanterns hang from the ceiling, their light at times a haze behind wisps of smoke drifting in from the galley.  In the center rests a huge cast-iron pot surrounded by countless tables and barrel chairs.  A half-circle driftwood bar is nestled in the corner beneath a salt-stained crest."
