      "Dazzlingly bright, this room is suffused with moonlight focused through hundreds of prisms in the narrow windows around the perimeter.  The light is focused on a dazzling, multi-faceted crystal poised on a twining vaalorn pedestal at the exact center of the space.  Inlaid in the polished alabaster floor, an eahnor circle connects four large feystone cabochons set at the cardinal points.  A polished faenor door leads out.",
