      "Whispers of familiar sounds echo from just beyond the immediate area, and short periods of intense illumination followed by furious cracks of thunder shake the encapsulating stone enough that handfuls of stone powder trickles from the ceiling and supplements the sodden state of the ground.  Silvery blue flecks mingle with the falling dust and simulate bioluminescent insects as they travel from ceiling downward.  There appears to be an open expanse to the north with substantial lighting."
