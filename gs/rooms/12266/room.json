      "A large palm tree has fallen across the pathway, preventing any further progress to the south.  Clumps of dark green grass grow in the middle of the path threatening to overtake the passage.  A long-legged sea bird stands in a nearby pool of rainwater, one leg tucked up underneath its wing.",
