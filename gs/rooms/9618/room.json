      "The sound of rushing waters comes from both sides, although quite a bit louder from the west.  Birches and poplars dominate the island's tree population, their long, thin trunks reaching up to the sky inside narrow columns of light grey leaves.  Many of them have died and fallen over, eventually decaying to leave white tunnels of birch bark scattered across the ground.  Thick grasses a foot high fill in the spaces between the trees.",
