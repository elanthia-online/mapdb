      "Partially open to the air, the watchtower looks out over the rolling woodland.  Its broad, open windows provide sightlines that stretch as far as the inhabited cove far across the Olbin's river delta.  The buildings of the port city there are diminished to specks by distance, and the fleet of merchant vessels bobbing in the bay are but a suggestion of bobbing sails."
