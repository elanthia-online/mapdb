      "Following the contour of the mountainside, the trail snakes in and out of crevices like a food-seeking reptile, but serves a distinct purpose to keep travelers away from the unstable ground beyond the shield of the summit's shadow.  Charred remains of unknown creatures are piled against the rock, placed intentionally as an offering or moved there by a larger predators is unclear.  Off in the northern distance, a rising trail wavers in and out of view, but appears to lead farther up the mountain."
