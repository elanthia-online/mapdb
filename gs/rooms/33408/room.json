      "Haloed in starlight, the northern end of the tunnel is wide and covered in pinned black basket wythe.  Conversely, the southern end of the tunnel follows the smooth, chiseled granite walls into the darkness where the sound of dripping water echoes in the air.  A small sign of parchment and bamboo is anchored to the opening amid the clustered vines."
