      "Pilasters that look to have been severed from several different buildings ring the circular chamber fronting the chapterhouse, their disparate styles suggesting a gamut of cultural origins.  Bronze statues stand in niches between them, glowering krolvin faces looking down upon a basalt floor with a blood red compass rose inlaid at the center.  Guild members in riotous attire ebb and flow through an arched opening of scrimshawed whalebone in the northern wall."
