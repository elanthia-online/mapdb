      "Bright white cabinets hang upon the walls above polished granite countertops, their tiny faces fitted with brass and ivory handles.  Red checkered curtains flank a window that presides over a tiny stonework sink that is filled with miniature cobalt blue and white dishes.  Pantry shelves display a large glass jar filled with eyes, several large cooking pots filled with ears, and a wide porcelain ewer filled with noses."
