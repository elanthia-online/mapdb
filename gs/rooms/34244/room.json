      "The arm and torso of a corroded bronze statue breach through the muck off the side of the raised terrace, slowly being devoured by the scouring vapors of the grotto.  Most of the features have been eaten away, but the figure's shoulders still have the trademark breadth of a dwarf's.  Heedless of the deteriorating relic, the muck bubbles and froths, stirred by heat and eruptions of foul gas escaping from below."
