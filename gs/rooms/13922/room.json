    "description": [
      "Thick rope supported between each wooden piling creates a railing for this small river dock.  Several wooden barrels are stacked underneath a large fish-shaped sign hanging from a weathered thanot shop.  A small wooden ladder secured to the edge of the platform leads down to a boat mooring.  Fishermen move about carrying boxes of supplies and baskets of fresh fish from the day's catch."
