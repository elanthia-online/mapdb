      "The tunnel ends here in a rubble and boulder choked cave in.  Sparkling veins of minerals reflect and magnify the light shed by the glowing moss to make this dead-end well lit.  The scratching and growling that fills the rest of this network of tunnels is much fainter here as if the light has driven away the denizens of this place."
