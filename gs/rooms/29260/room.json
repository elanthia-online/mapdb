      "Lacking any natural lighting, the corridor is riff with shadows that blink in and out of existence, and something nearby emits a rhythmic wheezing that is punctuated by a *drip-drop* sound.  The ceiling is unusually low, as if the walls are unable to support the sodden beams, threatening to cave in at any moment."
