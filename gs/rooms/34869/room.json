      "Towering overhead, fronds of lacy ferns take on the countenance of trees.  Nothing appears as one might expect here, with the thick and woody bases of oversized mushrooms making passage between them seem like an insurmountable feat.  Only thin rays of moonlight are visible through the filtering foliage above.  A fern-lined woven reed basket has been placed beside a tiny ground-level opening in the cottage wall."
