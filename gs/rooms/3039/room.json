      "Winding its way through a large open field, the broad flagstone pathway ends at the bottom of a short flight of stone steps.  Crenellated in design and constructed of cut granite, an imposing keep rests on a hilltop, the stone steps leading the way to its massive double doors.  Flanking the doors are two well-sculpted drake statues carved into fierce stances atop their stone platforms.  Battle standards have been placed behind each statue, the banners snapping loudly in the wind."
