    "description": [
      "A massive kapok sprawls atop rugged hills, some of its sprawling limbs bound with coarse vines to form treacherous platforms.  Near its apex, scratched runes and old blood mar the tree's bole.  Decaying nests of jungle twigs and leaves and dried mud cling precariously to the branches.  They emit a sour odor of spoiled meat.  Occasional feathers spiral lazily downward from the crude nests, caught in swirling currents of befouled air."
