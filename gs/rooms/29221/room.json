      "A sheer drop-off punctuates any attempts at travel toward the west, while a narrow, rocky trail funnels off to the east.  Some craggy steps carved into the cliff appear to lead downward toward an open space filled with greenery below.  The cry of gulls echoes nearby, their location obscured by a rising fog from the sea."
