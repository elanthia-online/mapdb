      "Rocks large enough for several people to stand on mix with smaller rocks, many of which are submerged below the cold, clear waters of the Locksmehr River.  Shadowy shapes dart underneath the water's surface, mostly in directions away from the sound of footsteps.  The cliff looms close by, and dirt, pebbles and even large rocks occasionally break loose to splash into the water.  As evidenced by the area heavily gouged out at the base, the cliff is losing the battle to the tenacious river."
