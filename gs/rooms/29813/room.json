      "Slender trellises of smoky haon and pale linden drape fragrant garlands of lavender grey roses, the vine work entwined along the tall lacquered pillars set into each corner of the shop.  Graduated pewter chains suspend starburst-shaped lanterns of vellum, the soft light illuminating a wrought pewter display against the back wall, the curio framed by charcoal-drawn renderings of various elven cites."
