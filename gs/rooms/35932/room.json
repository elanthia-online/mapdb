      "The quiet *ploop* of something dropping into the pond carries through the chill air from time to time, and the sound is evidenced by the accompanying shallow ripples that disturb the water's surface.  As the tiny wakes break on the shore, the reflections of the lantern lights in the trees undulate, winking languidly in the darkness."
