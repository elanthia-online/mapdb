      "The trail ends at the shore of a frozen lake that sits in a low basin here.  Waterfowl slip and slide across the opaque ice, like children at play.  The northern shore of the lake is formed by the sheer cliff stretching upwards towards a craggy mountain peak.  The other shorelines are comparatively flat, and heavily wooded.  Perched high upon the boughs of an edge-water pine is a thatched stick birds nest.",
