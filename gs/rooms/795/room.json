      "The ice beneath your feet has a layer of reddish brown deep within the icepack, bespeaking some act of terrible violence on this rugged promontory.  The slippery conditions do not provide a good place to fight, and so perhaps an accident caused the bleeding--but would that explain the deep gashes and chipped surface of the surrounding stone?"
