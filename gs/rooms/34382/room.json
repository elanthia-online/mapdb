      "Despite the vastness of the window, illumination for the shop is taken over by a multitude of frosted orbs that hang from the ceiling, emitting a quiet hum as they produce an even, steady glow.  Wares are arranged upon shelves and counters throughout the space, while a small worktable in one corner is covered in paints, vials, and etching tools.  A bespeckled burghal gnome glassmaker tinkers about, assisting customers with a grin from beneath his bushy mustache."
