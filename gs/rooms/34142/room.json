      "Stirring the contents on the bottom of a nearby pool and giving the water a ruddy tea color, a torrent of water steadily drains from the melting snows of a precipice above into the basin of the river.  Tall reeds breech the water's surface, and even more crushed reeds blanket the water's edge.  Tracks leading to and from the river from both large and small creatures are in evidence."
