      "The mineshaft widens into a small cavern lined with warmly glowing lanterns.  Along one wall numerous long crates and boxes are stacked haphazardly out of the way to ensure the path is kept clear.  On the opposite wall is mounted a large weapons rack filled with lances and other long polearms."
