      "A spacious white wooden gazebo offers rocking chairs, food, drink, and peaceful relaxation.  Around the gazebo four tall palm trees lean inward, shading the area.  Grey ice plant grows across the surrounding sandy beach, interspersed by patches of tall reeds.  Brass sconces mounted on the gazebo's beams flicker brightly, and a flock of geese honks noisily as its members splash nearby in the lake's waters.  An arching bridge leads north, while a tunnel leads under the lake to the west.",
