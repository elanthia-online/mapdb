      "Numerous silver lanterns are suspended from the ceiling in this room, their flames illuminating the shop with a warm white glow while a textured glass door remain shut to keep the cold night air at bay.  The walls have been largely left unaltered and the coarse, roughly hewn surface stands in stark contrast to the polished floor below.  Throughout the room, plush white wool carpets have been arranged to provide customers with a comfortable place to stand while examining the wares contained in a brightly illuminated jewelry case and a brightly illuminated jewelry display."
