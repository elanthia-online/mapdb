      "Driftwood planks warped by wind and water creak and shiver in the powerful current, their surfaces slick with algae and salt.  Frayed ropes arc between one pair of barnacled posts, a poor replacement for rusted iron chains bedecking the rest.  Broken crates spill strings of coral beads and tarnished metal tokens etched with unreadable runes."
