      "Heavily corded vines drape across the buttress roots that rise along the eastern edges, separating the dark swamp from the remains of a road overtaken by nature.  Glints of metal within the vines hint at something hidden in their depth.  Scattered cobblestones resemble pearly white islands within a sea of mist that clings to the ground, obscuring hazards and wonders alike.  Faint, yet rhythmic, the sound of metal striking metal rings through the air."
