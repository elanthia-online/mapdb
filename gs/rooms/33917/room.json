      "A long tunnel with walls wide enough for three dwarves to walk side-by-side, and a ceiling tall enough for an average giant to stand upright, leads south into darkness.  The smooth stone of the floor has a polished, shallow depression along its central track, evidence of centuries of foot traffic.  To the north a stairwell descends deeper underground."
