      "Rising above the wide variety of flora here at the water's edge, a soaring date palm with broad fan-like fronds stands guard over this secluded spot.  Smaller trees, a variety of hardy shrubs, and brightly colored flowers thrive under the protective shade of the mighty palm.  As the vegetation approaches the shore its makeup shifts, becoming less dense and making way for reeds and aquatic grasses.  It is here, hidden within these tall grasses, that a striated orange and red sandstone sits, providing a perfect view of turquoise waters bejeweled with shimmering light."
