      "Small and large cobbles stretch across the ground, their faces smooth and their sounds evenly rounded for a perfect fit.  Large windows of stained glass dominate the northern walls, while the southern ones are filled with marble-framed alcoves.  A line of woven reed prayer mats, each neatly positioned beneath an alcove, marches down the hall in both directions."
