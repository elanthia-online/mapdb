      "A high portico, still retaining a portion of its roof, extends out from the back of the building.  Vines twine up the supportive columns of the structure and out across the walls.  A brick walkway, badly overgrown with wild grass and moss, leads up to a gaping space in the wall of the building where once hung doors of more perishable material than the surviving bricks and stone."
