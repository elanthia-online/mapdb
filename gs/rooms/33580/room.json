      "Floating like clouds against an inky black sky, frosted orbs of magical light hover against the dark canvas of the pavilion and provide a soft glow that illuminates the tidy shop's wares.  Tables covered in pristine white cloths stretch across angled walls, while geometric-patterned carpets cover the ground with their warm colors and hypnotic designs.  Curtain ties hold the flaps of the pavilion open, providing a flow of air and a view of the streets of Bloodriven."
