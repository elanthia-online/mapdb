      "Built in a circle and enclosed by gleaming ebonwood-paneled walls, this room offers a comfortable and informal setting.  Several sofas, overstuffed chairs, and lounges have been scattered in a rough circle around a low glass-topped table.  Three-pronged iron candelabra dot the walls, holding natural beeswax candles with steadily burning flames.  Set into the wall and barely noticeable is a shadowy grey arch, and opposite is a narrow staircase."
