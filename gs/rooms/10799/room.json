      "[Great Oak, Landing]"
    ],
    "description": [
      "A wide doorway in the side of the great oak opens out onto a small landing.  Strewn with dried leaves and a thick layer of dust and grime, the landing looks out over the forest floor, some forty feet below.  From this height, it is apparent that some of the surrounding oaks have been infected with an unknown disease, altering their healthy bark to a stone-like grey and making it crack and splinter.  A barely perceptible breeze rustles the fallen leaves, causing them to swirl in a miniature whirlwind."
