      "This small, tidy room is sparsely furnished, with only a large desk in one corner, lit by a wall sconce and covered with various papers, letters, and maps.  A small footlocker sits in the corner of the room, and the walls are adorned with displays of different arms.  In the corner, a stand displays a gleaming suit of field plate armor."
