      "Permeating the shed is the scent of rotting wood, emanating from piles of the stuff stacked against the walls.  Though cramped, the space is organized into small work areas for guild members who venture in here.  A few tools lie on a thin iron rack in one corner, next to a giant luminescent toadstool."
