    "description": [
      "Surprisingly roomy for being inside a hollowed-out tree trunk, a swaying rope bridge leading from the retreat to the limestone cliff at the far opposite of the spiraling stairway lets in a soft breeze.  An over-stuffed sofa and complementing chair with ottoman are placed around a highly polished tanik table sitting low and holding some refreshments.  Resting on a square of dark terra cotta tile, a small black iron brazier glows steadily, the bright coals sending out a welcome warmth.  Decorations are minimal, allowing the patterns of the sapwood grain to stand out."
