      "Rafters sweep upward toward the roof ring in a clean vault, their lengths bound with orange geometric bands that repeat in steady intervals around the interior.  Wood planks form a smooth circular floor, each board fitted tightly against its neighbor.  Near the central post, a slow dark walnut counter stands ready for check-ins, its front carved with shallow compartments and its top kept clear for use."
