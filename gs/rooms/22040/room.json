      "A tall leaded glass window offers a view of the bustling streets below.  A rose vine-carved pearwood desk sits atop a floral and bird motif silk rug.  The tufted ivory leather chair behind the desk matches the chairs around a polished oblong mahogany table.  Tall pearwood bookcases circle the room, filled with books and small treasures.  A miniature replica of Silvergate Inn is centered on the oblong table."
