    "description": [
      "A square established by the intersection of four streets creates a large open space filled with various vendors hawking goods and services.  The square is unevenly paved in dark stone that continues up a street to the north and appears to sink into and under the sand-colored dirt prevalent throughout the rest of the neighborhood.  A large, shattered water fountain in the center of the square provides drinking water and adds a cheerful background gurgle."
