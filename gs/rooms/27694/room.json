      "Sticks of incense rest in several carved wooden holders on a low counter that traverses the muted beige walls that surround this room.  The heady scents of sandalwood, lavender, and orange mingle in the air, offering a calming atmosphere to the area.  Several sofas against opposite walls offering a place to relax, and potted ferns add a touch of color.  A sign and a rectangular mirror stand upright on one of the counters, while several attendants loiter about."
