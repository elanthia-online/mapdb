      "Piles of rubble bar further progress eastward along the trail.  The jagged ebon stones are all that remains of an expanse of cliff face that have broken away, undermined by the tireless efforts of the elements.  The rockslide has revealed a massive fossilized skeleton trapped in the rock, its form sinuous and serpentine."
