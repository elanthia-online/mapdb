      "Vines have woven themselves through the rusted iron chains swaying between driftwood posts along the dock, their dew-splashed flowers unfurling in an abundance of colors, from alarming pink to fiery orange.  The clear waters of the surrounding sea are a pellucid window onto the sandy shallows.  Bits of amber-tinted glass and fragments of old porcelain dot the pale underwater dunes, the leavings of another's plunder."
