      "Faint blue and green light originating from a pair of copper sconces illuminates the narrow, one-way passageway.  A sense of dampness pervades the area, with rivulets of water occasionally cascading down the stone walls from an unknown source.  Hanging from the walls are a number of artifacts, which have been stored, broken or their use long forgotten."
