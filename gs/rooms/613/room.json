      "The noise from the docks to the east swirls in on the breeze, the shouts and jests of the sailors creating a merry, if businesslike, atmosphere.  A small stone cottage stands back from the wey, a maoral sign tacked to its door.",
      "The character of the neighborhood around the Ta'Illistim airship docks could best be described as colorful.  The houses are small, with few windows, most of them barred, and the shops cater to a clientele more interested in instant gratification than the delayed pleasures of elven society.  One tavern is larger than the others, its roof less leaky, its windows unbroken, but its facade still grimy.  The cobblestones near it are scattered with the gravel that covers its small patch of hardscrabble yard."
