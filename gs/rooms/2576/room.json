      "You're in a shallow depression between the hill to the south and the higher slope to the north.  A sheer cliff to the east and a gorge to the west prevent travel in those directions.  There's actually green grass in this hollow, protected as it is on three sides.  It might be a nice place to rest for a while.",

The soft grass underfoot might make this a nice place to rest for a while if it weren't for the occasional sounds of large nocturnal scavengers going about their business."
