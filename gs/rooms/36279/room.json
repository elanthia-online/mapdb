      "Graduating from silvery pewter to rich plum, the walls are smooth and unadorned, providing a semi-neutral backdrop to the ornate, blown glass sculptures used to illuminate the space.  Several settees in silver-tacked aubergine recline along the western wall where a sterling silver serving cart provides refreshments to visitors, while opposite a brass and oak coat rack provides a tidy place to store garments.  Fitted with an ornate stained-glass window, an ebonwood door leads to the streets of Mist Harbor."
