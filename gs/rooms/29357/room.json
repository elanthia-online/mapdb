      "A small forge set on the far end of the room heats the area to a toasty, but comfortable degree, the hearth glowing reddish orange from the coals within.  A variety of well-maintained swages, hammers, fullers, chisels, bits, and other assorted tools rest above the furnace in an organized fashion.  In the center of the room lies an anvil the size of a small table, its surface clearly used, but in otherwise good condition.  A draped anvil-stitched curtain hangs nearby as a ready exit."
