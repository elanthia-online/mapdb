      "Winding steps dance across the spine of the dragon carved into the travertine and marl cliff and cut through its shoulders as it climbs past sweeping stone reliefs of a single serpentine arm.  The appendage extends dramatically outward, talons embedded into the cliff's face as if holding the mountain in a powerful embrace.  Delicate carvings highlight the dragon's form, merging with the natural travertine textures that frame the staircase."
