      "A brilliant golden glaes altar dominates this great chapel, shining brightly beneath several flickering torches.  A low murmur of prayer and quiet conversation flows throughout the room.  Dwarves of all classes file past the altar, leaving gifts and offerings to Eonak.  A flowing gold silk tapestry decorates the wall behind the altar."
