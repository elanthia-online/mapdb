      "Along the walls, a group of ebonwood coffins has been plundered, leaving only some skeletal remains.  The circular room is a dead end, and the only exit is the flight of steps leading back toward the front.  A rusted iron plaque, its surface barely legible, is hammered into the granite wall."
