      "Simple, but elegant, the teakwood flooring of this room is polished to a lustrous sheen.  An ivory velvet pennant adorned with a golden peacock hangs near a heavy wool curtain.  Hanging from one wall is an ivory-framed dark marble blackboard.  A small mother-of-pearl bin is tucked in a nearby corner."
