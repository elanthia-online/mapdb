      "Weatherbeaten fences section off pastures in the sage green fields, patchy with amorphous pockets of sanguine flowers slicked wet by dew.  A decaying, beaded pony harness hangs from a hitching post adjacent to the double doors leading into a dark red stable with low windows.  White beams cross the gapped facade, the paint chipped enough to reveal the natural wood grain.  Finely ground gravel, bursting with prickly weeds, lays a path to the small stone lodge set back from the road."
