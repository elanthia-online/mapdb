    "description": [
      "Waves batter the island's shores relentlessly, sending curtains of salty water skyward.  A low wall encircles the grounds as the only measure of safety against the rocks and watery depths below.  Four rectangular pillars, each roughly two feet high and bearing a distinct rune, form the corners of a sand garden.  In the center of the garden stands a flickering blue portal.  A rope and plank bridge connects to a rune-covered tower to the west, while an arching catwalk leads north to a gilded, dome-capped spire that glitters in the sunlight."
