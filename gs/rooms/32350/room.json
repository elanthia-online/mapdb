      "Clad heavily in hardy barnacles, black and rotting struts support the portmost of the docks' three tines as it stretches out into the water.  Droppings spatter the walkway, white against the grey and black of the wood, but not a gull's cry stirs the air.  The waters near the dock are shallow and grant glimpses of bright blue crabs scuttling around on the seafloor.",
      "The easternmost of the trio of piers is a mess of creaky planks spotted heavily with the droppings of seafowl.  Waters to either side are deep, black, and cold.  Stinging salt is so thick on the air as to have left cakes of gleaming grit on the nearby pylons."
