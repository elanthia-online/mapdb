      "Two layers of metal fencing separate the trail from the edge of a steep cliff.  Extremely tall, thin posts topped with glowing glass orbs are strategically placed along the barrier, each radiating a nearly translucent web-work of faint red lines.  A long winding staircase leading up into a tall stone tower is flanked by handrails painted in bright yellow.",
      "In the distance, beyond the trail, a mammoth nest can be seen, built in the crux of two flat stones that are braced to lean against each other.  A pair of adult griffins fly back and forth to the spot, attending to the structure itself and occasionally disappearing within.",
