      "This spacious room features a series of weapon and armor racks.  Each rack boasts a specific type of weaponry or armor, all highly polished and obviously well cared for.  Ranging from viciously serrated claidhmores to traditional whip-blades, a wide array of weaponry fills the leftmost racks.  The right side of the room houses various sets of armor, equally as meticulously maintained as the weaponry.  The far corner hosts a counter with your locker on it."
