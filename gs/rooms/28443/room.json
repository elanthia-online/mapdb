      "The staircase terminates in a small alcove recessed into the tower wall which contains a pair of sturdy iron doors.  Various sigils have been etched into the metal though they are of inconsistent quality, with some being very precise and deep and others appearing ragged and haphazard.  A rope is suspended from the ceiling to the right, and a small rug lies on the floor before the doors.",
      "The confetti-strewn staircase terminates in an alcove recessed into the tower wall, the streamer-strung pair of sturdy iron doors poorly etched with a smiling gargoyle face and several arrows pointing inward.  A duo of stuffed straw gargoyles lay against the colorful walls, their hands attached to garishly painted maypoles that droop slightly at the entrance.  Hanging from the ceiling is a spindly human-shaped lantern, casting distorted rays of light through the various puncture wounds riddling its body."
