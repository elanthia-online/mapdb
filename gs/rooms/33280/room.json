      "Bordered on its south by the interlocking pavers of the canal-spanning bridge, the sprawling courtyard is comprised of rounded cobblestones painted bright white and laid in concentric bands around a marble fountain.  Flanking the gates that connect Vornavis to Solhaven are wrought iron loops that resemble shepherd's crooks, each dangling a glass-doored octagonal lantern dormant in the daylight.  Branching out from the courtyard like the rays of a stylized sun, five avenues head deeper into the city.",
