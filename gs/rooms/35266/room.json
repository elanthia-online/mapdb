      "Suspended from a sturdy frame at the pier's end, a grand bronze harbor bell stands watch over the waters.  Next to it, a weathered sea chest, darkened by years of exposure, rests firmly on the planks.  Aquamarine waters lap gently against the dock, their rhythmic movement a constant companion to the bell's silent presence."
