      "Enclosed by varnished ebonwood walls, the shop features a bronzed drake sculpture in the center of its oak floor.  A round mithril-framed window hangs under the beam ceiling.  Right near the front is some mithril-braced shelves.",
      "A large veniom-edged mithril anvil stands in the center of a hewn stone floor, piled with various items for sale.  Directly above the anvil, suspended from a vaulted stone ceiling by a web of massive mithril chains, hangs a perfect mithril forging-hammer easily the size of a giantman.  One corner of the room is taken up by a cistern bearing the embossed image of an armored fly.  Opposite the anvil, against one of the smooth rock walls, a massive stone forge acts as a secondary display for wares."
