      "In an effort to accomodate larger clientele, this section of the table has been raised on wooden blocks, which does nothing to increase the stability of its surface.  Two of the chairs gathered here are oversized, padded chairs with high winged sides.  Squarely in the center of this section is a block-style thrak figure painted dark grey."
