      "Worn smooth from the elements and the passage of time, the boulder is surrounded in a halo of mist and moisture.  Moonlight bathes the expanse in a silvery glow that is picked up by the bits of mica imbedded into the stone.  A soft checkered linen blanket offers a quiet resting place beside a fitfully burning candle, while nearby natural steps descend from the edge of the boulder and disappear into the crystal-clear depths of the brook that passes below."
