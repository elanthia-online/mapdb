      "Mounded halfling-high toward the shore, sea glass of every color protects the coastline like a wall of jewels.  Glistening as water cascades over its surface, the sea glass belies the smooth edges of each individual piece by cohesively forming a whole of jagged magnificence both glorious and alarming to behold."
