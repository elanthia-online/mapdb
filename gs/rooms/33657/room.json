      "Next to an arched opening stands a wooden guard post offering an astounding view of the surrounding area.  From the top of the narrow roof on the keep tower, you can see the rolling hills to the southwest as they gradually blend into a flatter, slowly wavering countryside at the outflow of the river basin.  Glancing north, the land rises, becoming majestic mountains that stand tall and mighty, rising high into the sky."
