      "The room is decorated to resemble a cabin aboard a Krolvin-style sailing vessel.  It is floored with planks of teak, and brass portholes adorn the modwir walls, allowing shafts of sunlight to penetrate the interior.  A captain's bed almost fills the room's center, while a charting table is situated against the far wall."
