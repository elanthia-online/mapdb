    "description": [
      "Flowing with silver-flecked stream water, a series of marble channels follows the cobblestone path.  The shallow channels, built to hold no more than a few inches of water each, crisscross one another and rise and fall as the rushing water ascends and descends a pattern of carefully constructed, miniature steps.  The quiet gurgling of the silvery fluid seems harmonious with the natural sounds made by local birds and the rustling of nearby trees.",
