      "Nearly hidden in the shadows of the dirt walls is a large sack of cotton.  The markings on the sack are illegible now, but the burlap of the sack itself looks like it came from a well-known merchant in Wehnimer's Landing.  Whether he was having his own goods smuggled, or they were being stolen, is something only the sack itself knows."
