      "A swaying bridge of fragile planks and frayed rope stretches between towering trees rooted in the crags below.  Every breeze awakens creaks and groans from its length, chased by malevolent whispers from the disturbed leaves of the canopy overhead.  Dangling fetishes crafted from bone shards and leather strips clatter softly, as if in anticipation."
