      "Mounds of periwinkle and woodland phlox crowd the path, leaving little room to walk without treading upon the plants as the crushed blossoms send fragrance into the forest air.  A row of tiny glaesine globes, each holding a miniature white candle, has been posted alongside the trail to illuminate the way.",
