      "The chamber is cloaked in mist, hot with the breath of hundreds of small, unwholesome lungs.  A single ghostly shaft of moonlight cuts downward, illuminating an awful panorama:  The roof of the hutch sags over a twenty foot earthen bowl, alive with the tiny bodies of infant rodents.  Sticks, fur, and scraps of refuse fill the bowl with a horrifying nest for the little beasts. Rabid from birth, their passionate cries pierce the shadows like shattering glass.",
