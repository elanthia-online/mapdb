      "Coconut palms lean slightly over a coral-hued stone cottage tucked away from a seashell path, their fronds swaying above.  Lining a flagstone walkway are clusters of hibiscus and ginger bloom in brilliant colors.  A polished brass lantern with blue-tinted glass hangs from a driftwood post next to an ivy-draped white lattice archway draped in climbing passionflowers."
