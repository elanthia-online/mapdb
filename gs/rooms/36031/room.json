      "Clay beehive ovens rise in a low arc around the stall's rear and sides, their rounded forms filling the air with heat and their surfaces marked with faint soot at each vent.  A striped awning of yellow and green stretches overhead, its fabric tied to smooth white birch poles planted firmly in the packed earth.  Set beneath the sheltering cloth, a broad dark walnut table holds neatly arranged wares and small samples laid out for inspection."
