    "description": [
      "Though not precisely spartan, none would deem the cramped quarters as lavish.  Opposite the entry hatch, a glass-windowed porthole allows a glimpse of the airship's surroundings.  Nearby hangs a gilt-framed oil painting depicting a vibrant seaside town, the bright, cool colors contrasting starkly with the pallor of the light cast by a flameless glaes lamp atop a nearby writing desk.  The bunk is neatly made but spare, clad in a green velvet blanket and with crisp white sheets and pillows."
