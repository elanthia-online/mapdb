      "Evenly spaced along the dusty road, fitfully burning bamboo and hemp torches stand at attention as they guide visitors towards large wooden gates built into the face of a towering stakewall.  Spindly saplings dot the northern edges of the area amid verdant shrubs laden with bright orange and red berries, while tufts of grass sprout along the southern edges where a long guardrail blocks access to the cliff's edge.  A dazzling aerial view of a portside town can be seen from this vantage point.",
