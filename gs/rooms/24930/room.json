      "A dented, brass spittoon is installed at the end of a long oak bar carved with initials and peppered with cigar burns.  Around the taproom, mismatched, wooden chairs are bottom up on scarred tabletops in an uninviting manner.  A silvered glass mirror with a crack running through the middle hangs behind the bar."
