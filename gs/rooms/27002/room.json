      "Visible in orbit above the northern horizon, the proximity of Tilaok casts long shadows upon the verdant arcane dome that protects the area from the void of space.  Radiant emissions decorate the black of space as it travels in colorful ribbons between the two celestial bodies and blankets the lunar valley in shades of azure, amethyst, and emerald light.  The steady pulsing of a nearby glass-lined ring does little to dispels the alluring spectacle."
