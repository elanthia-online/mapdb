    "description": [
      "A number of stumps, their tops hewn off, gather around the edges of this clearing.  Some of the surrounding trees also bear the mark of the axe, and several have been felled but not trimmed or dragged away.  A pile of boards sits off to the side with moss covering the tops of most of the boards.  None of them look in good enough shape to make anything useful out of them.  A small side trail goes only a few yards into the forest to the west before petering out entirely."
