      "A woven floral tapestry hangs on one of the refined oak-paneled walls, and a viridian Vornavian silk ceiling rises overhead.  A potted palm tree sits in one corner of a varnished dark oak floor.  There is an aqua-hued seaglass display on one side of the shop and a long brass clothing rack on the other."
