    ],
    "description": [
      "Smashed pottery litters the upstairs landing of the small farmhouse, the low ceiling of which leaves the raw timber eaves crowding down upon the passage.  What remains of a rug cushions the hardwood floor in places, but exposure to the elements has left it a threadbare ruin.  The air is cold, and occasional breezes solicit rusty creaks from a rounded wooden door at the end of the hall."
