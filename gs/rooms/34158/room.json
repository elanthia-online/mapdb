      "Water drips in the distance, its beat slow and patient.  The work of the intrusive moisture is evident all around.  White flowstones drip down from higher ledges in the cavern like wax from a spent candle, their moisture-slicked lengths offering no purchase for aspiring climbers.  The silhouettes of stalagmites fill the darkness, lit only by the faint silvery glow of the fungus scaling them."
