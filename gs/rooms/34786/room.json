      "To the north the road divides around a large tree which has been spared, one lane passing on either side of the massive trunk of this aged forest denizen.  Despite the scattered dry leaves resting on the table and bench, the area beneath its branches appears to offer a neatly manicured shelter, creating a peaceful place to stop for a picnic or merely to rest weary feet."
