      "Completely covering the low dome ceiling are a sea of brightly dyed tapestries woven with the glorified images of bards engrossed in their artistry.  Smooth stone ledges display a variety of musical instruments, ranging from the smallest flute to a gigantic set of bagpipes.  A red-bearded dwarven clerk sits behind an austere granite counter, assisting customers with their purchases."
