      "Winds scream about the peak of the talon that gives the island its name, tossing the sparse grass scattered across the tiny plateau at the summit.  Sprouting from the grass as if it grew there, an ornate seaglass altar dominates the space.  Held aloft by a twist of seaglass is a clear glass orb.  Veils of swirling mist spin about the island as if it is the eye at the center of a hurricane.  They conceal all but the vaguest view of the storm-swept ocean and the mainland beyond."
