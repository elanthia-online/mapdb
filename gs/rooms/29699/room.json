      "A multitude of ribbons woven into a loose braid hangs in scalloped lengths along the upper tent frame, where the drape of the walls meet the ceiling.  At each point on the garland is a neatly arranged bouquet of flowers, each blossom in the bunch lending a sweet aroma to the air.  Diamond-shaped glass lanterns hang from the pavilion's supports, casting soft candlelight down on a central display and the blue parchment sign upon it, while leaving a small round table seated beneath a low shelf and a high shelf in the surrounding dimness."
