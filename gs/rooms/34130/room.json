      "Stretching out to the north, a sea of silver-barked aspens, leaves shimmering with the breeze, meets a distant lake.  Mists rise from the dark waters, obscuring the shoreline.  The majestic peaks of the Dragonspine wrap around the scene as the range pushes off from the east towards the northwest."
