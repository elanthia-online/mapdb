    "description": [
      "A series of cuts gouged into the rockface of the cliff offer a way to climb higher in the rocky terrain.  Piles of loose and crumbling boulders and stones bridge a steep descent towards a lower, and perhaps safer, part of the trail.  Beside the path, only a smattering of vegetation has managed to hold fast to the inhospitable ground."
