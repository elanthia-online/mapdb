      "Damp and drafty, this cell is virtually a dark cave.  So little light filters in through the empty doorway that it is nearly impossible to determine by sight where the cell ends on any side.  Only the remains of a broken and battered door lying sideways at the entrance indicate that this cell once held prisoners.  Chittering and scraping sounds echo from the darkest part of the cell."
