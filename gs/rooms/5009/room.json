      "A vast sea of grass as tall as a full-grown dwarf stretches off to the east, dotted here and there by the spreading forms of ghostly acacia trees silhouetted against the night sky.  The shadowy outlines of predatory nightbirds glide above the grass in the distance.  A sloping trail leads down to the west into a forested valley below.",
