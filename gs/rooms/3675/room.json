      "Blankets and canvas cover the carts and tables lining the sidewalks, the merchants having closed up for the evening.  The business of the day has faded away into the quiet serenity of twilight.  High above fly banners of blue, purple, and green, their colors muted in the cool silvery moonlight.",
      "Tables of silks and other fine goods line the sidewalk along the cobblestone path, carts of vegetables and fruits interspersed between them.  The hustle and bustle is less predominant here than in the bazaar to the east, though plenty of people can be seen browsing the wares for sale.  High above fly banners of blue, purple, and green, each bright in the warm sunlight."
