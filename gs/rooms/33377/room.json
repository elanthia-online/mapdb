      "Polished marble traverses the south-north expanse of the hallway, decorating the open space between stained glass windows and the portraits of nameless nobility staring blankly from the walls.  Twin doors, a plastered ivory door and an unmarked door, offer entry into other chambers, while a guarded staircase built between the pair leads to the Baronial Bower."
