      "The trail ends at the foot of a large, impassable jumble of basalt boulders.  To the east, beyond the rocky obstacle, one can glimpse a smoother landscape marked by striated bands of colored rock pierced by irregular openings and pools.  Contrasting the dark volcanic rock surrounding the area, there the palette is warm ivory white, yellow and sienna red."
