      "Pieces of well-used fishing net draped over wide fel rafters create a spotted canopy for a long crystal aquarium.  Dozens of stuffed fish stare blankly out over the dock from a wide window above their wooden display case.  The sound of water rhythmically lapping at the pilings drifts in though a large archway at the back of the room.  Hanging just to the left of the arch is a large thanot-framed painting."
