      "A forest of oak and fir trees spreads out to the east from the top of the cliff line here.  The ocean roars against the beach below to the west, and the smell of the salt is carried in mists on the breeze blowing in from the west.  The roots of a massive oak tree that has toppled to the beach below still cling firmly to the cliff top."
