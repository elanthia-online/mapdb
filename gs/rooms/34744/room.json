    "description": [
      "The roof of the temple cuts away to reveal open sky over a neatly manicured garden.  Pathways of crushed alabaster wind between planters ablossom with crimson and white roses.  The garden's real bounty occupies large mistwood stakes driven into the ground.  Many hoist lithe figures in clinging silk shifts hanging from manacles of white imflass, their moans and cries an incessant drone in the air.  A carved alabaster archway leads into a small sanctuary at the garden's edge."
