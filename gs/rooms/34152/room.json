      "A thick, heavy atmosphere fills the air with the acrid scent of smoldering metal.  A stone hallway leads towards several forging workshops opposite a steel-banded ironwood door that serves as an exit.  Dominating the far wall, a large placard crafted from wrought iron proudly showcases the forge's emblem, depicting a roaring furnace surrounded by a tapestry of intricately forged weapons and armor.  Lined up against a wall, a large steel workbench with several tools lies in disrepair."
