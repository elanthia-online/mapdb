      "Some curtained floor-to-ceiling windows allow natural light to fill the space and provide a view of the courtyard outside and the city beyond.  A large ebonwood sleigh bed flanked by a pair of ebonwood nightstands and gold wall sconces serves as the focal point of the room, its plush mattress topped with thick blankets and soft pillows.  Across from the bed is a comfortable ebonwood chair and a large cedar wardrobe, its doors inlaid with geometric gold leafwork."
