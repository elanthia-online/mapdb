      "One long root of a fossilized tree snakes out over the water.  Its thin length seems fragile, as if it could snap easily upon the bouncing of the easterly current so strong here near the black stones of Charl's Teeth.  Liquid sluicing down the innermost surface of the obsidian crag batters the long-dead root with obvious force, belying this illusion.  The tenacious root, grey and strong as granite, remains ever unbowed and unbroken against the power of the tide."
