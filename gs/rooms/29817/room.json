      "Dampness clings to the cracked stone walls of this lopsided hut, making the enclosed space perpetually moist and musty.  Guttering candles, their flames a sullen blue, are scattered around a central stone altar and the prayer rug laid out in front of it, the various items arrayed on top of them subtly reflecting the eerie light.  Wind constantly seeps into the area, sending the ragged animal hide over the door fluttering every so often."
