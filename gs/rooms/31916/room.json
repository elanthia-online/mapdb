      "The long, dark length of the Hall is punctuated here and there with floating globes of blue-lit glass.  A white carpet, its edges bound in silver wire, runs the length of the room, filling the space between a pair of large wooden doors and a glassy marble-keystoned arch.  Between the two portals, there is little furniture, though the bubbles of blue light do illuminate several pieces of statuary."
