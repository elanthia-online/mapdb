      "Shadows stretching across the landscape enhance the foreboding backdrop of the jungle against the natural beauty of the coastline.  Foam crests upon the wet sand, and shallow gullies are left in the wake of the ocean as it ebbs from the shore, only to refill with murky water when the tide comes back in.  A salty breeze permeates the cool night air, and moonlight reflects from the dark surface of the ocean as it laps at the beach.",
      "The constant presence of the jungle serves as a dark and foreboding backdrop to the beauty of the coastline.  Foam crests upon the wet sand, and shallow gullies are left in the wake of ocean water as it ebbs from the shore, only to fill with water when the tide comes back in.  Decaying driftwood clutters the beach randomly, with spindly seaweed tendrils clinging to the water-swollen debris.  A salty ocean breeze permeates the air, while the cries of seagulls join the lapping sounds of the water."
