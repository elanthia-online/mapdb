      "Floor-to-ceiling shelves fill every inch of wall space in this semicircular open office, and wheeled ladders stand ready for the clerk's use in reaching the higher shelves.  At the front of the office stands a spruce counter, its surface covered with a fine layer of dust that is undisturbed except in the areas surrounding a metallic instructional notice and a citizenship book.  Two torches burn on the walls, their light gilding the ubiquitous dust motes that float through the heavy air."
