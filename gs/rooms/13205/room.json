      "Expertly crafted from emerald-veined marble, a large fireplace provides a home for a pile of burning logs.  A finely tooled mantel is topped with a long black blade on an ebonwood stand.  Above the mantel, firelight dances eternally across a large silver banner.  Long black leather couches sit on each side of the fireplace, creating a conversation area around an enormous and exquisitely carved emerald table.  Evenly spaced ruby candelabra complement the firelight, and a small cherrywood bar stands in one corner."
