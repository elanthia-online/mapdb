      "A massive stone fireplace fills the eastern wall behind a long, pine-topped desk stacked with moldering texts and ledgers.  Overhead, a tiered chandelier of horns in all shapes and sizes is suspended above a wide staircase leading up to the second floor.  One corner of a bearskin rug has been thrown back revealing a dark hole in the floor."
