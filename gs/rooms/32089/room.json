      "Red cedar boards have been neatly nailed together into a fence that encloses this space into a private backyard and garden.  Whatever ground isn't covered by bushes, grass, and plants is scattered with overlapping tiny pawprints, chewed bones, and dug holes.  A tiny replica of the cottage is set in one corner, its surface covered in clinging ivy, the front door open to allow entrance for any puppy-sized animals.  A round steel bowl is set in the opposite corner, a similar bowl full of water resting beside it."
