      "A nook at the end of the hallway is home to a verdigris bronze statuette that depicts a ragged halfling man leaping at a heavily muscled krolvin, dagger flashing.  Several beeswax candles burn in bronze holders around it, brightening the dark corner.  A runner patterned with prancing mules in blue and white adorns the cedar planks of the floor, gliding toward a knotted pine door."
