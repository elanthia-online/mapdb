      "Ivory walls, paired with the pale gold and green carpeting, create a beautiful contrast in color and design.  A silver flyrsilk curtain weighted with a quartet of silver moon medallions hangs across from a midnight black velvet curtain adorned with an image of a swaying willow tree.  Suspended between the portals is a trio of crystal globes.  Fanciful shadows dance along the walls created by the flickering flames housed inside the lamps."
