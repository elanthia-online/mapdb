      "Several brocade-draped tables are set before the glossy wooden floor, each one laden with a variety of trinkets and treasures cradled between a duo of stands.  Tufts of wispy fur gather upon the thick woolen rugs beneath each table, the occasional paw flashing by, swatting at loose threads dangling from the shelves above.  An ethereal form passes through the back wall, the sounds of metal clanging as the mist traverses between the shop rooms."
