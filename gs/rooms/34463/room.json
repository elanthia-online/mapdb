      "Blending natural greenery with handcrafted art, ivory-veined ivy winds about the scrollworked legs of the whorled birch pergola, allowing only glimpses of the flora and fauna etched into the lacquered wood.  Glass jars strung with pastel ribbons hang from the crossbeams, the flame-tipped tealights within bringing a warm, flickering glow to a slatted knotty elm table flanked by matching benches."
