      "A damp chill permeates the bloated timbers framing the small pile of scrap and detritus in the ship's rancid bowels.  The tang of salt hangs heavy in the air, rising from pools of sloshing water that lap at the warped edges of an overturned hoarbeam table.  Also revoltingly present is the stench of old pitch, used in ineffectual attempts to stem the trickle of water through seams in the inner hull."
