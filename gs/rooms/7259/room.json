      "The thick, mossy branches of the overhanging yews cast shifting shadows over the walls and floor of the excavation, and filtered light flickers on the ground where a few shallow puddles of dampness have seeped in from the bog.  The walls of the pit are riddled with gnarled roots and long-buried bones still imbedded in the earth, and matted with layers of dirt and moss that hint that the depression was dug at least a century ago.  The south wall forms a slope leading up to the path.",
