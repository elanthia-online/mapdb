      "The stairs leading down into the hold are narrow, brushing the shoulders of anyone who tries to pass in a group.  Running down each side is a smooth modwir railing, polished by the many hands of past crew and passengers.  Glowing lanterns hang at regular intervals along the stairwell, casting a warm yellow glow on the steps."
