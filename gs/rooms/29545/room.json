      "A stately stained glass standing oil lamp sets a warm, welcoming glow in the simple cedar-framed room, which holds a long pale spruce table at its center.  Some black leather wingback chairs are placed evenly around the table's length, resting on a polished stone floor.  The rear wall is a wide panel of frosted glass that has been etched with an elaborate mural."
