    "description": [
      "Tall and unshorn, yellow and green blades of grass rise from the fertile soil and bend beneath the sporadic breezes that sweep across the plains.  Violets and baby's breath rise amid the verdant blades to add a spot of color to the largely molten expanse, while dark shadows along the edge of the plain hint at trees in the distance.  Narrow and winding, a game trail leads through the grass towards a hill to the south and a shadowy castle to the north."
