    "description": [
      "Clear blue-green water percolates outward from the falls to the north, gradually losing energy until it relaxes into this wide glassy mere.  Time has sculpted the depths of this not-quite-fathomless water hole, providing ample space for diving, as well as subaqueous swimming.  To the south, where the shore is a mix of jagged rocks and glittering grey sand, occasional surface calms provide brief glimpses of stolid shadowy forms far below."
