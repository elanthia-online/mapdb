      "Tall wrought iron candlesticks hold thick pillar candles of beeswax, offering a modicum of illumination.  Chalk residue remains in a thin layer upon the wooden floor, providing testament to some past ritual.  A small table rests against one wall, its surface strewn with the various paraphernalia required in the practice of the summoning craft, while pieces of waxed vellum inked with celestial calculations and archaic symbols spill over and onto the ground."
