      "The smell of sea salt is heavy in the moist air of the tunnel, enough so that it burns your eyes slightly.  The ground is thoroughly soaked and you plod about trying not to get stuck in the sandy muck.  Small cracks in the walls glow an eerie fluorescent green, illuminating the tunnel so that you can see it continue to the north and west."
