      "Several glass display cases are staggered into three rows, each one spaced apart strategically to allow a wide berth for customers to pursue the gleaming inventory within.  Heavy black brocade curtains are pulled back from a large front window, making way for an abundance of moonlight to brighten the entire shop.  Wispy tendrils of flowery scented smoke drift across the vermillion-hued walls, as patrons move about after being greeted by a smiling curly-haired shopkeeper."
