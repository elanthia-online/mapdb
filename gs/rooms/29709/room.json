      "Flowers of every variety drape from the rafters, the colorful blossoms strung together with bits of string and anchored in place by tiny hooks.  Shielded lanterns spill a pale blue light over everything, while a tiny brazier in the center of the enclosure keeps the space cozy and warm.  A pair of cots are pushed to the back to make room for baskets of string, scissors, and various other baubles."
