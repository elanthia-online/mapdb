      "Overhead, swirling vapor only partially conceals the deep claw marks that pattern the shadowed granite.  Several elongated egg casings jut from hollows in the rock nearer the tunnel floor and disgorge a viscous fluid from their ruptured sides.  The yellowish substance pools in the grooved stone and oozes over the lip of a nearby stone chute."
