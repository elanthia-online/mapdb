      "Greying planks sit just above the surface of the water, meeting boats arriving from across the way and providing access to the rocky shoreline.  Under the brilliance of day, the lake resembles a mirror reflecting the sky and milky clouds in its calm depths.  Though still now, there is an eeriness about this place that alludes to a superficial deception.  Over a jumble of stones lies the start of a trodden dirt path that curves southward.",
