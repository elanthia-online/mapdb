      "A narrow aisle leads down a slight incline toward a dais containing a lectern and several blue velvet padded chairs.  To either side of the aisle, tiers of wooden benches offer adequate seating.  Colorful tapestries on the walls depict memorable moments in wizarding history.  A small band of light shines through a curtained archway, illuminating a strip of carpet."
