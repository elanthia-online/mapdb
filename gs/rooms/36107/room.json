      "The workshop of Lord Dagmar is lit by smoky torches ensconced on the wall.  Hung over the fire is a simmering cauldron and beside the fireplace you see an intricate table covered in melted wax.  The floor around the table reeks of alcohol.  Near the table is a wooden cot covered with rumpled bedding.  Bookshelves built into the walls are packed to overflowing with ancient tomes of magic."
