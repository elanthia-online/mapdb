      "Opposite some drab greyed wooden stables, an embrasure in the city's wall is occupied by a large red oak ballista.  The squared dip in the wall provides a panoramic view of the island's northeastern reaches, though the furthest extremes of the vista are obscured by mists and ashfall.  Vast evergreen forests spread out along the valleys to the northeast, stretching almost to the black sand shores."
