      "The fishermen's bunks hang empty from the ceiling, their undersides now serving as shelves for the royal larder.  Piles of rotting fruits and meats line the jury-rigged storage areas and spill over onto the floor.  The menu boasts mainly garbage scraps and the place smells more like a compost heap than anything else."
