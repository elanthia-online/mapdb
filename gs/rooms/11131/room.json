      "A powerful jet of salt water intermittently shoots forth from a small hole in the ceiling, causing a rainbow colored mist in the room as the light filters through in between the spurts of water.  Your feet sink a bit in the sandy muck as the water collects on the ground around your legs.  Some of the water runs off to the east as a small breeze carries the salty mist off to the west."
