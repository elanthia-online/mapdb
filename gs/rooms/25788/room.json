      "Pale moonlight trickles through the verdant foliage that surrounds the large manicured lawn, which in turn sprawls before a stone and white stucco villa.  Crushed shells, their mother-of-pearl bellies shimmering in the silvery light, decorate the slender walkway that travels between the villa's entry and the distant dock.  Large planters, crafted of dark green bamboo, are set beneath the building's windows, each supporting a wide variety of tropical flowers."
