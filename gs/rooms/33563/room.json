      "Hanging from a low beam, an iron lantern provides very little illumination to the room.  Oiled leather, straw, and grains scent the air.  Particles from the dried goods float throughout the area, creating a fine layer of dust upon all the surfaces.  The walls of this room are lined with wall-mounted saddle racks, each bearing the weight of its namesake, while just beneath are barrels full of numerous equine treats."
