      "Gemstones nearly the size of boulders threaten to block any attempts of visitors to venture away from the established path.  Their glassy, colorful surfaces provide only precarious handholds for clambering over their rounded and polished faces.  Fiddlehead ferns with curly green tops rise far overhead like statuesque sentinels."
