      "The narrow stall has been erected with a framework of sturdy wooden shelves, the corners framed in metal-looped swatches of various materials dyed in bright colors.  A bookish Ornathian clerk rests behind a map-carved olivewood counter, the elongated surface extending at an odd angle to showcase a velvet-padded chest, the container covered in stylized calligraphy.  The faint scent of oud and saffron drift within the enclosed space, the aroma emanating from a peahen-shaped censer."
