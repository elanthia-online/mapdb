      "There are piles of black grit covering the floor here, almost causing you to sneeze.  Rotting pieces of soggy wood and several rusted shovels are scattered about the room, and a ruined wheelbarrow lies overturned next to a row of large empty bins.  Looking closer, you notice that there are faded words and symbols scratched into the walls above the bins."
