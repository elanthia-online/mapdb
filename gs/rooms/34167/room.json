      "Pallid fish with stunted, sightless eyes dart through the water near the northern shore of the lake.  Some of them fluoresce, and dot the pool with patches of ghostly light that dart aimlessly through the water.  Waves slap ineffectually at the stony shore, sluggish and small.  They leave behind undulating patterns of fizzing white foam."
