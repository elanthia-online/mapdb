      "Pale green Vornavian silk covers the walls of the small, yet elegant cottage room.  A chandelier set with frosted globes hangs from the vaulted ceiling, shimmering rainbows paint the walls as sunlight from a pair of skylights catches crystal fragments accenting the piece.  Soft ivory velvet drapes frame the tall windows while matching wool carpeting underfoot muffles all sound.  Several small jewelry cases are displayed on shelves behind the glass front of a polished linden counter."
