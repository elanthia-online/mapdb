      "A wide ledge runs along the curve of the cliffs, dotted by huge rocks and driftwood that has fallen from the slopes above over the years.  The blue water of the bay stretches into the distance, speckled with the colorful sails of passing ships.  A rocky trail winds down through the rocks to the bay."
