      "A gleaming moon of silver glints brightly from the surface of the table, which is carved from a block of dark modwir.  Paper lanterns pierced with stars and crescent moons hang overhead, casting gentle light over the secluded niche.  A spray of moonflowers sits in a small vase at the table's center."
