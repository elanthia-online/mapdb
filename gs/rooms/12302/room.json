      "Pots of various plants and flowers dot the oak floor, an occasional adventurous vine winding up the slats of the railing to reach towards the gently sloping roof overhead.  Hanging from the edge of the roof are a few wind chimes that tinkle with the slightest breeze.  Large windows look outwards from the front of the house, the edges composed of pieces of colored glass of many shapes and sizes.  The central part of the windows are made of clear glass, allowing plenty of light to enter the shop within.",
