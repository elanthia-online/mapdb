      "Although surrounded by giant taniks and pines the boulder give you the chance to look up and see the sky.  The stone is flecked with tiny facets of mica which reflect the moonlight, making it sparkle under your feet.  One side of the boulder is worn smooth from the many hands and feet which have clambered up and down its surface.",
