      "A set of curving stairs trails off at a statuesque pavilion with a peaked crown covered in slate shingling.  Three dewy glass walls seclude a silk-cushioned trestle seat, while still allowing a sweeping view of the profuse irises and fruit trees.  Sunken into the ground, a silvery stone water basin faintly glimmers under shifting beams of sunlight."
