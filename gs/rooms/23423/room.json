      "It is too dark inside this cave to see where the ceiling is, but it's somewhere very high up.  A faint glow highlights the sloping floor of the cave, which rises at first in a gentle incline and then sharply into a strange mound that seems to form the back of the cave.  Fastened to the mound is a thick rope ladder with leather ties."
