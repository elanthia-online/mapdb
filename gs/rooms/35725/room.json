      "Wind moans past the entrance of the cave, filling the narrow corridor with a low, reverberating moan as it descends into darkness.  Where the sun's light cannot reach, phosphorescent fungi flourish along the high stone walls, illuminating the path in eerie blues and unnatural greens.  The living curtains have almost entirely occluded primitive carvings etched crudely into the walls depicting upright beings with widespread wings and bloody appetites."
