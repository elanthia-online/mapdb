      "A short distance to the east lies a broad intersection.  To the west, the road narrows slightly as it is impinged on by closely-spaced shops, beyond which the western and southern city walls intersect.  A few townsfolk mingle under the circles of lamplight in the cobbled street.",
      "A short distance to the east lies a broad intersection.  To the west, the road narrows slightly as it is impinged on by closely-spaced shops, beyond which the western and southern city walls intersect.  Prosperous ladies and well-to-do gentlemen mingle in the street with the more common folk of the town."
