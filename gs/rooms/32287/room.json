      "Sawdust and woodchips cover the rough, uneven floor of the small shed.  Pale sunlight filters through the dirty panes of a crooked, narrow window, illuminating bits of dust floating through the beams.  An old board balanced over two crates is placed in the center of the small space.  Leaning against one wall is a neatly stacked pile of wood.  Hanging above an old wooden toolbox are several totes and satchels."
