      "Positioned between two wide picture windows is an ancient Olbin spruce scroll rack.  The scrolls within give off a scent that is both acrid and dry, a strange commingling of sour preservative and dusty old parchment.  Sinuous patterns in scarlet swirl through the window panes, making the rack look as if it is at the center of an eruption of color."
