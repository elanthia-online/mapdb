      "Here you see a dazzling display of mineral deposits.  The lava flow in this cavern must have been somewhat calmed or slowed for the metals and minerals to have separated by their weight.  This would be a miner's paradise as you see veins of gold, lead and even some silver ribboned into the walls.  Minerals have even begun the formation of crystaline structures, you can actually see the birth of rubies, diamonds and other precious gems, as the crystals will grow in time to form future treasure."
