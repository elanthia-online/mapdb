      "Colorful rugs woven from vibrantly dyed qiviut cover the circular shop, the fabric stitched in patterns of wild geese leading up to the elongated pine and rowan table set at the center.  Triangular racks of juniper are wedged along the khana of the ger, the containers set between cupboards, trunks, and other ingredient-filled larders."
