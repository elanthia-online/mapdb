      "Not quite a room, the ceiling is barely high enough for a man to stoop and not hit his head.  The crawl space stretches off to the west where the ceiling lowers and the end is lost in the dim and dusty air.  The only light filters up from a rectangular hole in the floor.  The layer of dust on the floor around the hole has been disturbed, rendering some areas cleaner than the rest."
