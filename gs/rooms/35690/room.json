    "description": [
      "A jagged chasm mars the surface of the disc.  The stone is blackened and bubbled and looks as if it ran like liquid before resolidifying, leaving behind an unsightly wound, the edges of which bleed stormglow in erratic spurts.  Crystal clear water lingers in the depths of the scar, but it is devoid of life, with not a shred of moss nor a single fish visible in the pellucid pools.  An awful statue looms over the devastation as if exulting in the defacement."
