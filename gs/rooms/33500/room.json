      "Sheltered beneath a hunter-green striped canvas awning, rough-hewn oak benches are evenly spaced with hardly enough room to sidle between.  A spilled ale tankard and overturned basket of roasted peanuts lies forgotten beside a steel-banded cask branded with a sloppily painted rolton.  The wooden floor sags under the weight of the crowds in this area and is covered with a thin layer of gold-hued sawdust."
