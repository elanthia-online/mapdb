      "Dominating the immediate view with five large piers, the docking structure is comprised of water-darkened fel and oak boards with ironwood support posts set at regular intervals.  Each docking slip has its own thick bumper of cork and canvas with a handful of unused buoys tied to a piling.  A large sign hanging from the rope and oak railings reads, \"North 'Haven Quay, Green Pier - Slips 1-5,\" and shards of bright pectin shell are inset along the outer edges."
