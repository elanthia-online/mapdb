      "One of the squat black stone buildings along the cobblestone street is an alchemist's shop, as evidenced by the brightly colored potion bottles glinting from its windows.  An old stone idol stands in the red grass yard before the store.  Most of its features are worn away, but a hunched posture and a mouth of jagged fangs suggest that it once depicted a krolvin form.  The air around the idol buzzes as if alive with energy."
