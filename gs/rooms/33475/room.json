      "Enclosed by whitewashed shiplap walls, the shop features a large brown bearskin rug in the center of its plank pine floor.  A tattered merchant permit hangs under the post and beam ceiling.  Right near the front is a live edge oak table inlaid with a blue resin river and a glass display case framed in richly stained oak."
