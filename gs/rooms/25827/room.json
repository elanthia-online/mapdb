      "Visible signs of erosion cause the beach to be short, and the incline to the center to be steep.  Tiny white pebbles stand out in glaring contrast to the stark uniformity of the black sand that covers the ground.  Here and there, seagull feathers drift across the ground or are carried out to sea by the receding tide."
