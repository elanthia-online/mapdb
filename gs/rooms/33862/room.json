      "Twin fountains of sun-washed limestone frame the ivory stucco building, the quiet burbling of the blue-green water intermingling with the sounds of commerce from the nearby boardwalk.  Ink-painted terracotta pots encircle the base of the fountains, the rich soil revealing shoots of verdant foliage and budding flora.  The splayed branches of oleander and lemon trees drape over the paved road, perfuming the area in heady fragrance of sweet vanilla and citrus, the scents intermingling with the faint notes of saltwater."
