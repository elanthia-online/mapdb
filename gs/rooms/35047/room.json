      "A lush midnight blue runner unfurls from the arched entry of the auction house, escorted by a phalanx of carved basalt columns.  Banners of the same moody color, fringed with golden tassels, hang from the cloister vault ceiling, their swaying reflected in the uneven black stone tiles of the floor, which are polished and worn smooth.  Heavy glass panes laced through with adamantine filaments protect the acquisitioners working in the hall, and krolvin hireswords stand ready along the walls."
