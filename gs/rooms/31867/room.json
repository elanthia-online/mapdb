      "Dark roots shatter a cobblestone pathway running through a dark briar arch, and thick ice coats everything except a shadowed, windy path running east to west surrounded by dense trees and briars that arch overhead, nearly blocking the sky.  Tucked between vine-wrapped oak, ash, and rowan are several smaller buildings, and narrow trails wander off the main path, disappearing in snow drifts, looming trees, and thorny bushes."
