      "Driftwood beams, bound by braided, dried seaweed, splay out into the sapphire blue sea like silvered fingers.  Thick planks creak, swaying with the might of the current, their surfaces slick with moss and framed by posts crusted with salt.  The warped timbers strain under the weight of broken crates full of chipped pottery and dark metal coins corroded past the point of any value."
