      "Below a series of torches that cast their golden light on this area, some sturdy shelves of walnut display all kinds of cloth and leather baggage.  Stacked along the wall below are larger storage containers for customers who want to move more goods.  A worn stool next to a cupboard off to the side provides the owner of this shop a place to rest their butt and beverages."
