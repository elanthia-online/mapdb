      "Sprouted with crimson-capped toadstools and blanketed in verdant mosses, a fallen tree bridges the breadth of the creek, powdery decay spilling onto the path from one jagged end.  A low mist hangs above the steadily flowing water and creeps over the root-threaded banks.  Slowly, it twines around the scattered, multicolored inflorescences flourishing within the adjacent verdure."
