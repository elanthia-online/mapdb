      "Traversing a series of grand stone steps, the staircase meanders along the dragon's lower spine, offering sweeping views of the travertine terraces below.  Faintly warm mineral springs flow alongside, their gentle steam rising to the cool air.  Carved details of dragon scales cover the steps, their edges worn smooth by centuries of use.  Ornate iron lanterns, suspended from intricate brackets, cast a soft, ambient light that dances across the terraces' gleaming surfaces."
