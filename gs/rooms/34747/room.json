      "The walls of the hallway are a lightless black, matte in a way that reflects no ambient radiance.  Despite their tenebrous shade, hints of color swirl through the darkness, taking on strange forms.  The images stretch along the walkway, creeping toward faltering radiance in the west, where stairs of gold-shot marble ascend to a semicircular dais."
