      "Traversing the meandering trail proves tricky, trailing creepers and cat's-claw snatching at the clothing of passers-through as if to draw them into the verdant morass of vegetation.  A boscage of plant life girds the small road, constantly at odds with the foot traffic as it attempts to consume the ashlar paving stones disrupting its quest for hegemony."
