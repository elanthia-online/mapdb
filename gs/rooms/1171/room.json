    "description": [
      "The river makes a sharp turn, curving around to smash into the bluff just to the southwest.  The constant pounding has caused the bluff to plummet into the churning waters, creating a large strip of exposed rocks and boulders.  Above, where the trail should be, large trees cling to the edge of the bluff's side, and the undergrowth prevents passage through that area.  With no other place to go, the trail descends the face of the bluff.  To the northeast the trail resumes its movement along the bluff."
