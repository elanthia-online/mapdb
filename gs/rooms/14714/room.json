      "The ledge opens out into an outcropping of craggy red stone overlooking the expanse of forest below.  The river forms a silver ribbon far below, and the mists of the wilderness beyond blur the horizon.  Flowering plants and bushes grow thick against the canyon wall, their fragrance filling the dry air and attracting buzzing bees and insects."
