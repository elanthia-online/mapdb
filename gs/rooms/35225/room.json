      "Heavy curtains of mist writhe over the stone floor of the sanctum, but they give wide berth to a raised dais of slick black stone adorned with a gilded bas-relief ring of interlocking feathers.  The relief is echoed overhead in concentric rings that rise to form a dizzyingly high dome that stretches up into impregnable blackness.  Despite the oppressive darkness, there is a luminous glow to the edges of the stones and throne that resembles nothing worldly."
