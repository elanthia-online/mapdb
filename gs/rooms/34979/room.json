      "Lichen thrives in the shadows of rounded stone boulders near the shore, the blankets of green contrasting sharply with the unrelieved black of the sands.  The rocks are stained with the droppings of sea birds that flock the beach, seemingly heedless of the intense cold.  Brine is bitter-sharp on the air."
