      "Beautiful paintings cover the walls, honoring wizards from all over Elanith.  From ancient, shriveled elves to scraggly haired gnomes, each picture is a masterpiece.  Some of the frames have small name plates to identify the subject, but most of the pictures leave the content forever anonymous.  In the center of the room sits a currently empty desk, adorned only with a cup of coffee.  Beyond the desk is a gold-banded ironwood door."
