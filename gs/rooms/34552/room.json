      "Amethyst and golden specks add color to the thin ivory carpet of woven plant fibers that covers the floor.  Centered in the room is a small mistwood table that holds a variety of refreshments.  A group of chairs are placed in a circular pattern about the shop.  Standing next to a silk-curtained archway is a polished silver filigree mirror."
