      "Several large passageways converge here near the opening to the cave.  A crude leather flap covers the way out, and to the west you hear the distant sound of dripping water.  A foul stench, which seems to be coming from the north, permeates the air of this room.  To the northwest, a well travelled passage leads back into darkness."
