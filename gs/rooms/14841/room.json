      "The water of the tranquil lake sparkles brilliantly where the moonlight strikes its surface.  Barely visible in the distance, dozens of burning candles float upon the water, their tiny flames almost indistinguishable from the reflected stars.  Small waves ripple against the shore before you and a cool breeze caresses your skin.",
