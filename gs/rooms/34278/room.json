      "Arranged in a chaotic array, spools of thread in various colors are attached to thin spindles that stick out of the walls, each trailing a thin string that flutters when anyone passes them.  Several stools are scattered about the floor and are surrounded by baskets filled with embroidery hoops, thimbles, needle cushions, and scissors.  A large modwir door leads to the front of the shop."
