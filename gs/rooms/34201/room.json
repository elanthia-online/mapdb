      "Flashes of amber illuminate the tunnel mouth to the south and are cast back by the protruding points of quartz studding the stony ceiling.  A broad vein of aventurine paints the western tunnel fork a rich, blue-tinged green in glittering swathes, the exposed gemstone polished to glassy luster despite remaining unexcavated.  Wafting in from the northeast branch, the scent of warm, damp air mingles with an underlying note of musky astringency."
