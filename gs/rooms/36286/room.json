      "Plump pillows and overstuffed sofas encircle a massive riverstone fireplace sunken into the center of the room, creating a comfortable place to relax.  Large animal pelts are scattered underfoot, cutting the chill of the stone flooring.  Sturdy oaken beams bring the circular walls to a peak overhead.  Against one wall, a long sideboard offers food and drink.  A glass panel leads out to a lush garden."
