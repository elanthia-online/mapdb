    "description": [
      "Its base secured by a trio of flat boulders that are covered with the remains of spent tallow candles, a totem of carved driftwood rises out of the ground.  The boulders' faces are carved with leaping dolphins and swirling patterns that are repeated in bright paint on the totem alongside a stern, bearded face and the repeated image of a golden trident.  Beads, bits of seaglass, and other offerings have been heaped at the totem's base."
