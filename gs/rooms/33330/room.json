      "Ivy trickles over the top of an ecru-washed birch bookcase, its cluttered shelves illuminated by a broad bay window encapsulating a mint velvet bench.  Terminating to meet a geometric coffered ceiling, a blush silk wall sits behind a glass-topped birch desk outfitted with a plush ivory chair.  A duo of coral ceramic pots sprouting ferns flank a gilt-flecked leather couch while above a trellis-patterned sideboard and various shaped crystal vials holding trilliums decorate the wall."
