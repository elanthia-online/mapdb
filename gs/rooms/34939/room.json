    "description": [
      "A scattering of flat-topped boulders encircle the blue-colored waters of the pool, the ripples gently lapping against the strands of sea kelp clinging to the sun-bleached rocks.  Bright flags of sailcloth hang in garlands across the ramshackle lighthouse erected from various scraps of wood, the ship names carved across the planks in a myriad of languages.  Nestled away from the rocks are several otter-carved stools and tables covered in banana leaves, the seating shaded by a grove of verdant palm trees."
