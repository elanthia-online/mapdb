      "This large cabin is warm, well-lit, and quite comfortable.  A fine selection of hand-tailored clothing is displayed upon a low wooden table in the room's center, and dozens of hats and other miscellaneous accessories line the shelves along the walls.  The slight scents of pipe tobacco and tanned leather mingle together to give this cabin a pleasant aroma.  An occasional quiet, high-pitched squeal from the east mars the otherwise tranquil setting."
