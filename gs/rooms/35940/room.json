      "Sheltered by the broad, leaf-laden limbs of an ancient oak, the small clearing is covered with thick blades of grass.  Several large bricks support an enormous wooden tub that is filled with water and wooden ducks.  Lounging nearby, a freckled young boy watches over the floating avian collection."
