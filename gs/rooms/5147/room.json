      "This room glows with a soft light, as moonlight pours in from a large hole in the ceiling directly overhead.  Warmer air blows steadily through the hole, and sand that has blown in on the breeze covers the floor.  Small grasses grow in the sand, not nearly as tall as the grasses on the rolling dunes outside.",
