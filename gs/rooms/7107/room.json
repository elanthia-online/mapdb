      "The stink here is overpowering.  A score of rats swarm over what remains of a medium sized carcass.  It isn't quite the right size or shape to be a human or an elf, but it could conceivably have been a dwarf.  The rats squeak and hiss at your approach, backing reluctantly into the shadows until only their glowing yellow eyes are visible."
