      "Four spindly platforms extend from each of the towers out to the floor of this workshop.  A flawless dome of clear crystal covers the area, protecting it from the vagaries of the weather.  Within this nexus, a nervous guild apprentice sits serenely amid four circles of red, white, green, and blue marble set into the floor.  Soft moonlight is enhanced by magical globes above each exit."
