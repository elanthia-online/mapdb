      "Tall, spear-like crystals of translucent quartz sprout in a meandering line through the center of the granite corridor, leaving space to edge past on either side.  Several of the hexagonal prisms end not in natural points but in ragged splinters where their tips have been broken off.  Concentric bands of pale stone ripple across the tunnel ceiling, curving down along one wall before tapering off into the shadows."
