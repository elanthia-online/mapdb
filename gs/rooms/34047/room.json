      "Great steps, with smaller ones carved beside them for ease of passage, bridge the space between the southern gallery and another along the cavern's western edge.  The stairway passes beneath a vibrant mural, the considerable and obvious age of which has little dimmed its jewel-bright colors.  Statues positioned along a high balcony take the shape of adventurers ranging in size from halflings to kindred, holding carved torches aloft as if to hold back the dark."
