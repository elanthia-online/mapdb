      "Rich granite from Teras Isle lines the lower walls, contrasting beautifully with the white marble.  Gold veins, naturally running through the stone, shimmer under the pendant lanterns.  Central to the room is a teller counter, forged from Terasian ironwood, detailed with hammered gold, and shaped like waves crashing against the shoreline.  Above, a large mural depicts the ancient volcano of Teras, with dwarven miners chipping away at its base."
