      "Flames leap and roar from an immense bonfire built beneath a gap in the cavern ceiling through which the light of the distant stars beckons.  Huge logs and flat boulders are positioned around the pyre's perimeter and have been draped with leather and furs.  The bonfire is fed mostly with pine and spruce, which fill the cavern with the crisp effervescence of burning resin, but neither wood explains the strange bluish cast to the roaring flames."
