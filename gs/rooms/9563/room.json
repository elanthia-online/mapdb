      "Reflective tiles of polished steel have been deeply imbedded into the natural walls in a repeating pattern of diamonds.  A navy blue wool curtain drapes across a small passageway leading into the shop's storage area, though access to it is restricted by an expansive granite counter.  Prominently displayed on a series of wrought iron tables and racks are magical devices and tools of differing origin, each merely a small example of the wares for sale."
