      "A tumble-down building once made of stout wood, stands here, still resisting the winds and weather.  Whatever paint it had has long been scoured by sand and salt, and the wood looks sickly pale in the moonlight.  Age and the harsh climate here give an almost serene dignity to the old place.  On the side facing the sea, an old hatch cover still serves as a door, hanging by the corroded threads of bronze hinges.",
      "A tumble-down building once made of stout wood, stands here, still resisting the winds and weather.  Whatever paint it had has long been scoured by sand and salt and the wood has been bleached golden with streaks and lines of white from crusted salt with deeper red smears from rusted nails.  Age and the harsh climate here give an almost serene dignity to the old place.  On the side facing the sea, an old hatch cover still serves as a door, hanging by the corroded threads of bronze hinges."
