      "The walls of the cottage seem to be a welcoming shade of green at first glance.  Then, curiously, as if the sunlight streaming into the expansive windows has changed at the whim of a drifting cloud, the walls shift in tone and appear more of a rich shade of blue than green.  A hand-painted mural covers the entire back wall.  Against a wall sits a teak credenza, framed by windows which offer a view of the gardens and trees outside."
