      "The tight lines of barley plants arc to the northwest and south.  A large number of heavy rocks infest the area, and the number of barley plants is reduced proportionally.  The rocks stick up from the soil at odd angles.  Some are long and thin, protruding more horizontal than vertical.  Others are just strangely shaped, as if some rock-eating creature had come along and taken big bites out of them.  Still others are just normal, everyday, run-of-the-mill, round boulders."
