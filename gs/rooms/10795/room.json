      "Split and warped from a drastic change in the shape of the tree which holds it, the one-room cabin creaks and shudders from even the slightest movement within its ragged confines.  Gaping holes, torn open from branches which at one time supported the weight of the small structure, rend the walls.  The wooden flooring is blanketed with dead leaves and an odd assortment of feathers.",
