      "This oak panelled room is bare, save for a portrait hanging on the east wall.  The smooth wooden floor has been polished to a high sheen, and your footsteps echo softly as you walk upon it.  Four silver sconces containing white candles are strategically placed on the walls, lending a soft glow to the surroundings."
