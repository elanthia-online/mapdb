      "Softly flickering candles illuminate a massive carved mahogany bed and a narrow writing desk topped with a variety of quills and scrolls.  A cream-colored sylvan rug lines the rosewood floor beneath an exposed beam ceiling.  A pair of cushioned cross-frame chairs is positioned at the foot of the bed and an embroidered tapestry lit by frosted pendant chandeliers hangs behind it.  The far wall is dominated by an imposing marble fireplace, with a basket of sticks placed nearby."
