      "The tunnel splits around a nigh-transparent crystalline column embedded with metallic red and gold rutile filaments.  Butter yellow gossamer clings to the northeast fork, partially occluding the passage from floor to ceiling along one side.  The northwest fork is clear of obstructions, though puddles of some sticky substance meander across the uneven stone.  Droplets of foul-smelling water trail away to the south."
