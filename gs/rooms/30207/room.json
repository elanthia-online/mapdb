      "Salt-stained oak and fel piers spread across the large docking structure, providing ample portage.  Each ironwood support post has been carved with the image of a peg-legged cat, and the powerful scent of salt water and seaweed drifts in the breeze.  Strung from the hempen railing, a large sign reads, \"North 'Haven Quay, Blue Pier - Slips 16-20.\""
