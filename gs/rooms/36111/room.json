      "The room is dimly lit by a crackling fire that flickers in the granite fireplace.  A thick velvet rug covers the floor before the hearth.  Three walls are hung with heavy drapes dyed a color deeper than midnight.  Nearly all light is swallowed up and the room seems a lair for dark thoughts.  A giant painting of a misty forest draws your eyes upwards, and you realize the ceiling has been painted to match the night sky.  So real it seems that for a moment, your head swims in confusion."
