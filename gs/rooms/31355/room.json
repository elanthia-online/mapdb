      "Somewhat shielded from the elements on three sides by the roof of the cabin, this cleverly constructed perch looks out across an expanse of undisturbed snow.  The night sky is brilliantly lit with an innumerable number of bright stars, and a pair of padded wooden chairs are situated to allow both comfortable relaxation and easy access to a small rhimar chest strategically placed between them."
