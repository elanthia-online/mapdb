    "description": [
      "Luminaries dangle from the branches of neighboring trees, their soft glow illuminating the branches in pinpoints of yellow, white, and gold light.  The scent of moldering leaves hangs heavy in the cool air, side by side with that of maple sap and freshly disturbed earth.  It adds a certain weight to the air that is heightened by the dimness of the surroundings and the stillness of the pond.  Resting beside a copper and mahogany bench is a woven river reed basket filled with smooth stones."
