      "The trailway climbs toward higher ground, weaving through falling ash and around rivers of blazing lava.  To the west stands a mountain with a broken peak, one of several fountaining its fiery blood onto the lowlands.  Northward rises a vast plateau cloven in twain by a river of molten rock.  Winds carry the distant sounds of civilization, from the creak of carts to the cries of children, but they come in tantalizing snatches lost to the louder complaints of the earth."
