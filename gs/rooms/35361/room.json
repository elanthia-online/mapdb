      "Rough oak steps lead upward from glistening kidney-shaped tidal pools to a stretch of white sand, their surfaces weathered by salt and time.  Amid the pools and dunes, a copper-bound rough oak barrel stands beside a shucking oyster harvester, its form worn yet unmistakably functional.  Shallow waters mirror the sky, capturing fleeting images of drifting marine life along the rugged shore."
