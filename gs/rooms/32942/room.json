      "Rough wooden timbers form the walls of this small shop, lengths of braided cord tethered from one side to another.  Dangling from the cords, a selection of colorful kaftans, pantaloons, and burnooses sway gently as a coastal breeze pushes its way through the entrance.  A tall copper-framed mirror is affixed to the wall adjacent to a small pedestal near a wooden order counter, where a young rosy-cheeked woman stands attentively."
