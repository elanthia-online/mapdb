      "The flat hilltop extends to the southeast.  Something slithers across the gravel behind a rock a few yards away, and the ever-present lizards coolly keep watch over your movements.  A group of white wildflowers have taken root in a depression on this windswept hilltop, and they display their flowers as signs of their defiance to the elements.  The moonlight glints brightly off the scoured rock surfaces.",
