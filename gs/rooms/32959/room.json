      "A large rectangular table dominates the center of the room, with an even larger map of Elanthia draped across its surface.  Small figurines of obsidian and wood sit atop the map, marking various locations across Elanith.  Faint etchings mark the known locations of major structures, cities, and terrain.  An ornate steel-banded silver door serves as the room's only exit."
