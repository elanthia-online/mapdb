      "The riverwalk ends at a stone breakwater on the eastern end of the island.  The great Tempest River divides here, a smaller branch flowing north, the main branch continuing along the southern side of the island.  A stucco watchtower stands like a ghostly sentinel in the moonlight atop a grassy knoll on the breakwater.",
