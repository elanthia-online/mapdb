      "Lit from either side by a pair of glimaerstone lamps, the passage is split by a heavy red brass ladder leading down to the orlop.  The sounds of the weather deck overhead are muted by solid wood, but not entirely inaudible.  Everywhere there is a faint thrumming, as if the walls themselves were suffused with the life and pulse of a great beast."
