      "Quaint and tidy, the rustic shop has exposed beams and knotty oak paneling.  Thick rugs of braided linen are spread across the floor, making it impossible to determine what color the creaking boards are beneath the explosion of color.  A long glass-front counter spreads across the expanse between the two corridors that lead deeper into the store, while the white birch door leading to the street is fitted with painted rose-colored glass."
