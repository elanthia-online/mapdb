      "The dank and musty aroma here is so pervasive as to almost cause choking.  A few cracked beams supporting the cottage above sow seeds of doubt about one's safety here, but fortunately most of the heavy wooden structure overhead is dry and intact.  A scattering of black mold spores near the crawlspace opening shows the primary area where moisture seeps in."
