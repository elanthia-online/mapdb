      "Chilled air seeps in through the tent's linen walls near the ground, while the upper reaches are protected by thick, furred hides hung from the wooden supports.  Lanterns with squat, ovular shades in hues ranging from amber to crimson dangle overhead, giving off warmth as well as a scent that is spiced though subtly sweet.  At the center of this area is a tiered wooden display table, with a row of copper hooks fixed on one of the larger supports, and a low-profile wooden shoe rack set neatly beneath.  A multi-hued linen runner leads further into the tent."
