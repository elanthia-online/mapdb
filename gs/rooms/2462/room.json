      "Bumblefinger's Pawnshop is perched on the south side of the road, the well-tended wooden building draped with several blue and green banners proclaiming its low prices and fine goods.  Several giantkin mill about outside, counting their coins.  Freshly painted some white stairs climb up to the pawnshop porch.",
