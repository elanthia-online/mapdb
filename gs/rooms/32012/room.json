      "A two-storied home sits upon the desolated hill, the blackened silhouettes of flames encompassing the stone walls.  The faint glinting of broken glass litters the dried grass beneath the house, the metal window frames warped into contorted curls of melted iron, the claw-like bars extending into the dwelling."
