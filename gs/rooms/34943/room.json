      "The centerpiece of this sparse, uncovered section of boardwalk is a river rock hearth set on metal legs.  Around it, a considerable space has been cleared to allow bystanders to gather.  To one side at the boardwalk's edge, a woven net tangled with bits of kelp hangs from twin driftwood pillars through which bright azure waters stretch toward the horizon.  To the other, wooden pylons are set to mark spaces to fish or use as tie-offs for smaller watercraft to be pulled up close to the boardwalk."
