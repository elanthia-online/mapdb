      "The shallow steps of the winding stairway taper off at a round room marked by a group of narrow slitted windows.  Pale starlight shines through the narrow gaps in the stone, shimmering wanly against the bits of ice formed along their edges.  A steel grommet fixed beneath one of the wider windows holds a long length of rope."
