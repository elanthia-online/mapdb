      "The conflicting tones of black and white assail your senses as you gaze around the room.  Your eyes are drawn to a sculpture in the corner that seems to be turning.  The cool onyx and white ora floor is offset by a warm snowcat fur rug in front of an onyx bed.  Along one wall stands an altar in contrasting patterns of black and white ora."
