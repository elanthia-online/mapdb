      "A rocky wall rises up along the sea channel.  Cracks mar the smooth sea-worn surface, giving roothold to various plants and vines.  A small pool collects at the base, its depths littered with a variety of colored shells brought in from the sea with the tides.  Various crustaceans move about, darting from place to place."
