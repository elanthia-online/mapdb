      "Sunlight spills through the high windows recessed into the blackwashed walls, creating bands of shadows and light upon the heavy cobblestone blocks of the floor.  Brass fixtures adorn the edges of each accounting booth, where lanterns provide additional illumination, the polished metal gleaming and lending an air of opulence to the otherwise austere space.  Twin arches lead deeper into the structure, while a steel reinforced ladder leads to a guardsmen's ledge where archers watch the proceedings with keen eyes."
