      "Spaced far enough away from the main dining hall to offer a portion of privacy, a blocky ebonwood table is draped with a crisp white cloth and set with a cut glass vase brimming with fragrant mournblooms.  A thick parchment menu lies open atop the table drawing attention to the chef's specialties and gourmet fare.  Flickering votive candles cast a soft glow on a silver-framed portrait hung on the wall, its subject gaunt and in need of a good meal."
