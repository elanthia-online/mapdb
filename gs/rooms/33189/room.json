      "The polished black granite flagstones are covered with a thick handwoven carpet.  Several large oak chairs sit in a semicircle in front of the massive marble hearth as if pulled together for a quiet conversation.  On the wall above the mantel, five long daggers are arranged in a star-shaped pattern, the edges of the dark blades glistening in the firelight."
