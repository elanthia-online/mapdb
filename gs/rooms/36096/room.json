      "The house taproom is finished to rustic perfection with cherrywood-panelled walls, a stone floor covered by a huge bearskin rug, and a cherrywood bar fronted by a round table and several chairs.  The flickering light of hand-crafted oil lamps glints off the bottles, prompting an undeniably parched and thirsty feeling in your throat.  In the far corner, a set of steep stairs leads down to the basement."
