      "The chilly wind blows across the open space, amplifying the sounds of waves crashing across the Tenebrous Cauldron as they echo across the wooden framework.  A hemp rope-knotted vine hangs along a beam set across the cylindrical roof, swaying gently in the ambient breeze, causing the tiny bells woven through the fibers to tinkle quietly.  Unoccupied nests of straw and shredded parchment frame the staircase leading down to the ground, the wall above them affixed with small trinkets crafted from sea glass."
