    "description": [
      "The northwest corner of the crystalline cavern is bathed mostly in tints of sapphire and white due to the preponderance of blue toadstools in this section.  Other colors are evident, though, due to the refractions from the dome's crystals.  A long, thin opening interrupts the crystals high on the north side of the dome, and the sound of wind coursing through a tunnel emanates from that area.  A wide entry occupies the west wall, flanked by two huge furs, and a marble table abuts the north wall."
