      "A hallway winds through walls decorated with bas-relief carvings of a variety of instruments.  The floor is covered with large tiles, and a plush runner twists along the meandering curves, precisely following the twists and turns of the hall.  The rug matches the light-toned stucco walls, and a series of conch shell lanterns are suspended overhead.  An arch opens on the South Wall, revealing a pub beyond and admitting mouth-watering aromas and the distinctive clink of plate and mug."
