      "This spacious but cozy room is lined with bookcases containing tomes on every aspect of Elanthian life.  A wooden four-poster bed covered with a white quilt stands against the back wall, a massive misty glaes trunk at its feet.  Several paintings stand displayed on a modwir nightstand next to the glowing fireplace that brings a sense of warmth to the room, and a small shrine stands near the door."
