      "Twisting its way in an ambling fashion through the gardens, the crushed seashell pathway glitters in the light of the moon and slips between rows of carefully cultivated roses.  Two different scents mingle in this area, the semi-sweet fragrance of the bright pink dog roses nestled in bushes and the heavy, heady scent of the black dragon roses that stand tall on their long stems."
