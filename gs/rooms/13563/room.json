      "The broad sweep of the pine floor is interrupted by a pile of unmarked crates.  Halfway to the arched ceiling, a pair of crossed cavalry sabers hangs on one of the plain wooden walls.  A rusted metal display rack and a splintered cargo crate are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
