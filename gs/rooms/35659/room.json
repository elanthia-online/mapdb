    "description": [
      "A precarious ledge juts out from the middle of the stone wall just over an arm's breadth away from deep niches in the black stone.  Winks of gold and other precious metals flash from the darkness of several of the crevices.  A single such recess might be the work of nature, but the even procession of them suggests the use of tools.  Above, the cliff face is smooth, offering little purchase for climbing beyond a few slick handholds.  In some places it appears smooth as volcanic glass."
