      "As the tunnel angles from northwest to southwest, it slopes downhill and the passageway becomes more rocky and difficult.  The soupy fog rises as the way descends, as if the floor is the bottom of a pool plunging down into the depths.  Moisture has collected in this branch and creates a steady drip from the rough ceiling, collecting in pools within the rocks that are hidden until one chances to step into a slippery puddle."
