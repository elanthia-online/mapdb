      "Several boulders have been gouged into a stairstep pattern, creating the eastern wall of the structure.  Upon their surfaces, herbs, reagents, and supplies of every type are organized and labeled, while a lithe sylvan apothecary, dressed in light blue chainsil, busies herself keeping everything just so.  One particular shelf has ingredients yet to be ground or distilled, and before it stands an ebonwood work table with several mortar and pestle sets ready to do the job."
