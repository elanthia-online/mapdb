      "Amethyst-dyed swaths of silk encircle a diminutive white marble fountain at the center of the room, the curved basin filled with a variety of gemstones occupying the castle-shaped vessel.  Radiating outwards from a sunburst-shaped chandelier are falls of silver-forged beleria the flowers' unfurled petals highlighted by slivers of lilac-tinted arathiel.  Murals of an airship-dotted sky encompass the pale blue-colored walls of the room, the far corner nestled with a crystal-inset spire rising into the clouds."
