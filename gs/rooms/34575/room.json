      "The path appears endless, its twists and turns attempting to disorient those who traverse through.  The forest's thorny walls are lined with sharp thorns that glint in the dim light.  They almost seem alive with malevolence as they reach out to snag your clothing and scratch your skin.  The silence is only broken by the occasional rustle of leaves or the snap of a twig underfoot."
