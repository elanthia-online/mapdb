      "The ceiling and walls in this room have been painted pale blue, with fluffy white clouds here and there.  On the floor is an intricately woven rug that is entirely comprised of a landscape.  Tiny trees and shrubs, and the peaks of mountains in detailed perspective, give the illusion of the lay of the land from a bird's-eye view.  A colorful patched linen balloon is suspended above a large and sturdy woven basket.  Next to the basket is a tall sign."
