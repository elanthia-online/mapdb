      "Longer than it is wide, the pantry is lined on either side with narrow rosewood shelves and cabinets, their bounty great enough to lend the room a sense of mild claustrophobia.  The far wall features a low row of built-in cubbies complete with a locker prominently arranged for easy access.  Warm sunlight spills through a narrow window above, reflecting off a small imflass mirror resting on one shelf and gently illuminating the pantry's shadows with a gold glow."
