      "Gruesome instruments of torture fill this room, although most are now broken beyond repair.  The dampness of the castle walls here has promoted the growth of several molds, and a dank, musty smell hangs about the room.  The vague stench of death wafts up from cracks surrounding a trap door in the floor, filling you with dread."
