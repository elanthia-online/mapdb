      "The trail veers sharply inland as the bluffs grow unstable, undermined by the ebb and flow of the icy tide with no beach to protect their base.  To either side of the path, tundra grasses grow thick on the tops of earthen humps deposited by the wild wind, looking like colorful tufts of scraggly hair.  Glistening white drifts, the product of recent snows, are scattered across the harsh landscape."
