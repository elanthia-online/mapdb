      "Tall oaks and modwir pines have grown up along the outer edge of the western palisade surrounding Wehnimer's Landing.  To the north you hear the sound of horses stamping impatiently against the wooden walls of their stables as they await their turn in the Jousting Arena.  The wind whispers softly through the trees, bringing you a sense of peace as you wander.  A shady path leads off to the southwest, sheltered by a thick stand of modwirs."
