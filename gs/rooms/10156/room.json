    "description": [
      "Dried, dead roots wind their way across the earthen walls, occasionally being blocked by the crumbling remains of a stone wall visible through the moist dirt.  A few rusted sconces still perch upon some of the sturdier stones, though each now holds a skull instead of a flame.  The aged scent of decay lingers within the musty air, and an overwhelming stillness pervades the underground crypt that not even the faintest sound from the surface disturbs."
