    "description": [
      "Warm light fills the colonnade, spilling from stained glass lanterns suspended from the terracotta ceiling.  Shifting colors dance across the floor tiles and nearby vendors stalls, creating geometric patterns upon their surfaces in emerald, green, and amber.  Ribbons and banners stir lazily in the breeze, their ends curling and twisting about the pillars they are anchored to.  Murmured exchanges and the clink of coins drift through the air as a testament that the market is open despite the hour."
