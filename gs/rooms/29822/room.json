      "Warped and uneven, the wall-to-wall pine floorboards display signs of water damage, which cause many of the copper nails to rise up from the seating within the wood.  Floor-to-ceiling bookcases are pristinely kept, their clean shelves a stark contrast to the utter gloom that hangs over the rest of the shop.  A lone candle rests upon a counter covered in cobwebs, its flickering flame threatening to consume the dusty gossamer strands."
