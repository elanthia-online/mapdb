    "description": [
      "Clear of debris, the central waters of the pond are still, while its edges are murky and brown with sediment from a slow tributary stream beyond a row of clustered mangroves.  A moss-covered sunken fishing dock creeks softly underfoot, connecting at an angle to another section of planks by a natural bridge of tangled vegetation leading east.  Occasional splashes near the dock's pilings confirm any suspicions of inhabitants beneath the surface."
