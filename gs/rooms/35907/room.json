      "A small wooden footbridge, lost to the elements after years of disuse, spans a thin run of water that twists its way down the slope, ever running toward the shallowest point within the valley.  Small stones and clumps of moldering leaves bend it out of shape, diverting the water in a series of turns and miniature falls that leave a lingering gurgle of water in the air."
