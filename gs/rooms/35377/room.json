      "Offering a stunning view of the travertine terraces below and the sheer cliffs above, the veranda is encircled by stacked marl stones that form a protective wall.  Comfortable seating areas are arranged throughout the semi-circular space, their tops decorated in bright blue, green, and red cushions that offer a contrast to the stark white travertine of the area."
