      "Wind whistles through cracks in the walls of the poorly built hut and threaten to extinguish the flame of a dented bronze lantern hanging from the ceiling.  Various odd-sized crates and barrels, many of them speckled with dark stains, are stacked haphazardly throughout the room, forsaking any sense of organization.  Several table legs lean against a massive stone chest placed in the back of the room and along the walls, hanging from pegs, are numerous dented cups and nets of broken dinner plates."
