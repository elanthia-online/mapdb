      "The branching tunnelway slims into a narrow recess, walls pressing in on both sides.  Heat from nearby vents and the closeness of the space conspire to magnify the odor of old rot rising from a corpse propped up against the wall of the chamber.  Mushrooms sprout from the figure's drooping flesh, the decay of which has been accelerated by the hot dampness of the nook.  The fungi make it impossible to discern the deceased individual's features, or even its gender."
