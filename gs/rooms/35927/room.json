      "Within the deep woods on the other side of the split rail fence that separates the path from a misty maze of trees is the shadowy outline of an old barn.  Its countenance is askew, slanted to one side, and bearing the shape of a bent, old man, stubbornly hobbling along with a cane.  Gaping holes in its side gaze at onlookers like dark eyes, the jagged edges of the crumbling wood lined by the pale fall of light from nearby lanterns.  To the southwest is an awning-covered field."
