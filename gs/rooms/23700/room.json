      "Stacks of tightly packed blocks of ice are nestled next to the earthen walls.  A variety of tongs and picks hang from cast iron hooks on the walls, in easy reach for moving the frozen water.  Peppered with sawdust, the frozen heaps insulate each other, keep them from melting.  Several large hunks of ice are scattered carelessly about the room."
