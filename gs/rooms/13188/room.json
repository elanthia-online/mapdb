      "The branches of the ancient linden tree twist about themselves, offering numerous locations throughout for comfortable seating.  Five-petaled golden flowers and verdant leaves gently rustle against the soft bark of the tree, and the sweet fragrance of nectar permeates in the air around you.",
      "The branches of the ancient linden tree twist about themselves, offering numerous locations throughout for comfortable seating.  Five-petaled flowers shimmer softly with a golden glow and verdant leaves gently rustle against the soft bark of the tree.  A soft, gentle hum can be heard emanating from within the core of the tree."
