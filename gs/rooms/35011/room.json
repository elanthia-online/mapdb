      "A small fetish of scrimshawed bones and shark teeth hangs from the lintel of the lighthouse's entry arch.  Relentless ocean winds whistle through gaps between the rounded stones making up the edifice's walls.  Though sparsely furnished, the antechamber is occupied by a winding stone stairway that curves toward the upper story."
