      "Painted in vivid colors and with lifelike realism, a mural decorates the northern wall of the pavilion and stretches into the ceiling.  Along the western edge, gnomish trinkets, baubles, devices, and mechanisms are depicted in garish grey, black, and mud brown hues as they encroach upon the verdant foliage of the eastern side that is redolent with fauna, organic growth, and vibrant elementals.  Pure white globes illuminate the space, while a smooth bench rests upon the thick carpeting."
