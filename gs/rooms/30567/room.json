      "This small room's walls have been painted a pale red.  A skylight in the ceiling gives access to the day's light and is likely the cause for the fading of a heavy wool rug on the floor.  A sturdy barrel-shaped workbench stands off to one side, its weight having formed a permanent circle in the rug beneath it."
