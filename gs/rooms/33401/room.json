      "Rays of moonlight pierce through the ceiling-high windows of the conservatory, highlighting the orderly wooden bookshelves filled with colorful leather-bound tomes and folios.  Several embroidery-covered chairs are scattered beside the live-edged haon table, the arrangement facing the blackboard attached to the sketching-draped walls.  A tri-legged easel stands beside a staircase leading to the facility above, the narrow hallway displaying artifacts and small knickknacks on angular displays."
