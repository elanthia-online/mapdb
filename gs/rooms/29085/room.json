      "Built at the corner of the stockade fence, the parapet widens into a full circle with vantage points to view the cleared areas below.  Placed in the center of the smooth wooden platform, a long bench sits beneath the shade of a protective roof.  A rain barrel with a thin mesh screen over it collects runoff water from a large pipe connected to the shingled roof."
