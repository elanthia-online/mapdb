    "description": [
      "Copper-bound planters stake out the edges of the flagstone terrace.  Orchids grow in profusion in the raised beds, the riot of blooms ranging in hues from snowy white to startling fuchsia.  Cloying sweetness from scented oils drifts from the double-door entrance of a capacious marble bathhouse, which reveals an opulent interior lit by candles.  The stone is predominantly cream-hued, but has flourishes of richer ash rose traveling through it in striking veins.  An arched black gate leads back out onto the road."
