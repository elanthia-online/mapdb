      "Beneath the blanket of night, the coral's bioluminescent veins pulse to life, casting vibrant hues of turquoise and fuchsia across the soft sands below and the lattice-like coral roof above.  The glow seeps into the surrounding kelp walls, their edges limned in color as fronds dance with the current.  Beyond the kelp walls, dark waters press close, broken only by the shimmer of passing fish.  A hollowed niche in the rear wall gleams faintly, its contents illuminated in the rhythmic waves of the glowing coral."
