      "Screaming wind tears through this area, filling the air with a dreadful howling.  Just ahead a cavern looms, offering a bit of solace from the biting wind.  As you move closer to the safehaven, you see that the cavern is actually the open mouth of a massive, long-fallen statue - the wind, an eternal scream."
