      "Threading through the crowded boles of trees, the trail winds in a serpentine ribbon, making directions turn back on themselves in a dizzy coil.  The trees seem like an endless, confusing wall of similarity, each with heavily furrowed bark and impossible size.  Overhead, the dense ceiling of black leaves creates a murky gloom beneath their boughs, as if the sun is afraid to penetrate their shadows.",
