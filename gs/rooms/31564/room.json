      "Filling the space from the high-raftered ceiling to the polished bird's eye maple floors, the sweet scent of sugared confections is mixed with vanilla, chocolate, and pumpkin.  Warmly glowing lanterns flood the space with light, making it impossible to see the street beyond through the store's front windows.  A short glass display cabinet occupies a space near the door, while a round table and high shelves fill the rest of the display area."
