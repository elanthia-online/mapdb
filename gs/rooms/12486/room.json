      "The gazebo is polished brass, gleaming brightly as a halfling at breakfast.  Delicately carved benches of white modwir are set in a semi-circle, surrounding a small, raised stage.  The gazebo walls are lined with small, clay pots, each of which is home to a single red rose.",
      "Polished to a bright shine, the brass frame of the gazebo reflects the sunlight with a brilliant gleam.  Carved benches of white modwir are set in a semi-circle, surrounding a narrow, raised stage.  A small copper-rimmed barrel sits to one side, its base encircled by a ring of wildflowers.  Tall, clay pots that line the walls are each home to a single red rose."
