      "Thin strips of sinew are threaded through lengths of canvas and stretched between carved wooden poles that create the framework of the shelter.  Bits of rope are wound about the supports and are adorned with various caved ivory charms.  Centered in the small space is a large stand crafted from several racks of antlers."
