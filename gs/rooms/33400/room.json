      "A number of live-edged tables are scattered across the perimeter of the facility, the various cuts of wood covered in lacquer to preserve the fine grain.  Displayed at the center of the room are a small duo of potted gardenias, their intertwining branches grasping upwards toward the branch-like lantern hung above the crossbeams.  Clay and ceramic pots are stacked haphazardly between tall wrought iron stools, the seating weighed down by small canvas bags of soil."
