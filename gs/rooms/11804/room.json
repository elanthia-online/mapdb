      "Two massive granite sentinels reach toward the sky, flanking the road as it moves to the west.  The sentinels are highly weathered, and their surfaces are pitted and cracked.  No method of circumventing the sentinels presents itself if one wishes to continue along the road in a western direction.  One must pass between the sentinels.  To the southeast the road enters a spacious mud plain."
