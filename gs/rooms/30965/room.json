      "Resting in planters against the railings that stretch across the western edge of the courtyard, cultivated lantern trees are filled with flickering orbs that illuminate the immediate area.  Fragrant aromas drift free of a cornflower blue pavilion, whose tied-down sides keep the cool night breeze from invading.  Cajoling the stars, the ocean tide lyrically rolls across the rocks far below and fills the night with a soft lullaby."
