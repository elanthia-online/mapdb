      "The trail ends abruptly at the edge of a swift stream.  Lichen-covered granite lines the bank, and mossy round stones can be seen under the water.  The brook foams white where it passes around obstacles and is crystal clear in the small pools and eddies.  Moonlight streams through the trees, reflecting off the creek with a silvery brilliance.",
