      "Heavy drapes, thick and voluminous, trail from polished brass poles in blended shades of dark green and black, each drawn back to provide a view of the street below through whorled glass-paned windows.  Thin-striped grey-on-plum bourde fabric dominates the walls where decorative glass sconces are supported by polished faceplates.  Glass-fronted trophy cases decorate the southern walls of the corridor, their spindled legs resting upon a thick carpet of woven ebon and scarlet wool."
