    "description": [
      "Only two toadstools, growing in large pots, remain alive along the tunnel, and their weak glows indicate that they are not long for this world.  The others have died and fallen over, extinguishing their luminescence and plunging those areas into darkness.  Several of the crossing support beams have broken, littering the floor with sharp wooden pieces, and the ceiling sags dangerously in these sections.  To the north, a timber extends across a wide trench that traverses the floor from wall to wall."
