      "The wind whistles softly through the upper reaches of the surrounding trees, providing a soft backdrop for travel along the road.  The raucous call of a blue jay occasionally echoes from deep within the forest, and bullfrogs respond from the moister, sheltered patches beneath fallen logs.  Warm air circulates lazily along the road, and it would be as easy to curl up and sleep under one of the large, spreading pines as to continue to forge on along the cobblestone way.",
