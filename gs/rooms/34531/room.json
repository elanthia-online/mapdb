      "Thick clusters of trees draped with curtains of dense vines surround the small glade.  Visible through the loosely woven canopy, pale moonbeams filter down, illuminating a lanky pale seedling.  A tangle of roots travels away from the focal point, branching out to the far edges of the clearing.  Small shrubs and rich clusters of fern carpet the forest floor, their greenery creating a verdant perimeter."
