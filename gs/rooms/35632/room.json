    "description": [
      "An immense banyan tree spreads its massive branches outward, draped in vines and moss that cascade like living curtains.  Roots thick as a man's torso push through the dark, rich earth, sheltering hidden alcoves that have likely not seen light for centuries.  Insects hum and buzz among its branches like mad, talentless choristers, their even droning a steady counterpoint to the erratic ebb and flow of bird calls and bestial chittering in the heavy air."
