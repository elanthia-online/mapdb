      "Low, wide oak benches suitable for sitting or sleeping line the walls of this spartan room.  In the middle of the room, surrounded by a cluster of stools, a few plain but sturdy tables have been pushed together.  Tall, narrow windows are set in the stucco walls, permitting a night breeze that smells faintly of saltwater.  Hung on the wall is a small sign.",
