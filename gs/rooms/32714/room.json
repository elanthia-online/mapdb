      "Starlight from alabaster skylights gently illuminates this comfortable room, casting a soft light on the many exotic plants growing here.  A profusion of heat-loving tropical vines twine about a white-veined green marble fireplace, their flower-laden tips nearly covering a silver looking-glass set above the mantel.  Pots of bright crimson and gold dragonstalks nearly obscure a pinewood bar flanked by a pair of white, green, and silver banners.  A brilliant green faenor medallion caps the painted trellis archway leading into the room.",
