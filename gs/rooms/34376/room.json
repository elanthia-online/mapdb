      "Chilled beads of water rain down from the cave's stone canopy, a veil of moisture clouding the main panorama.  Partially excavated, with a mining pick lodged into the granite and its wooden handle broken in half, a small alcove gathers a pool of water as its entrance slopes downward.  An iron lantern with yellowed glass panes hangs from a patinaed copper hook."
