      "Squared stones tile a narrow walkway between two heaps of glittering spoils.  Chests full of gold, silver, and electrum coins spill their contents over marble busts wearing necklaces of emerald or ruby.  A garland of flowers made from gemstone flakes hangs from the edge of a portrait framed in widowwood.  Only cordons strung together by steel chains stand to dissuade clever hands and larcenous intentions.  A dark blue-grey banner marked with a trio of conjoined faces hangs from an archway leading north."
