      "The sunlight shining through the thick, leaded glass window casts a warm, relaxing light through the room.  An oak bedstead holds a thick feather mattress on which a plump, down-filled comforter has been folded.  A blue vase holds some freshly cut golden chrysanthemums.  A cinnamon-colored wicker chair occupies one corner.  On the wall is a framed oil painting."
