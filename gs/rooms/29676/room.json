      "Scattered rugs of heavy wool stretch across the muddy ground, providing a layer of warmth that keeps the cold earth and subalpine breezes at bay.  Burning lanterns release spicy fragrances into the air and maintain a soft golden light throughout the spacious tent.  Woven river reed baskets are tidily tucked away beneath a low pine table that showcases a small display stand and a variety of wares."
