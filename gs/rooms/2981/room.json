      "A small path of pale rock chunks and powdered plaster leads up to a breached white brick wall at the ossuary's far end.  The wall looks to have exploded outward, as if blown apart from the other side.  Oddly undisturbed, a thin marble shelf to the left of the opening holds a tall slender vase, which is adorned with a dried garland of wild roses around its slender neck.  A flickering torch has been driven into the ground below it, though its light seems uncertain and barely throws back the darkness beyond the breach."
