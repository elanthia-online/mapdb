      "Secured by heavily reinforced hinges on a grey granite wall, an invar-banded gate is guarded by a small parapet to either side.  The wall extends north and south, beyond numerous rows of sturdy saplings, curving from view as it bends to encircle the settlement beyond.  Armored dwarves stand at attention within each parapet, crossbows at the ready."
