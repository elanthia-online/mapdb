    "description": [
      "The trail opens into a small clearing, where several old, rotting logs line the muddy banks of the Locksmehr River.  A wide rope bridge stretches east, across the river, toward a narrow island in the center of the swiftly moving current.  Resting off to one side of the trail is a neat stack of wood.",
      "A small clearing opens up at the bank of the river.  Several old, rotting logs line the muddy banks of the Locksmehr River.  A long, narrow island sits in the center of the water, sheltered from the swift movement of the current.  A hefty amount of cracked and faded wood is stacked neatly off to the side of the trail.  A tight rope has been strung above the river to serve as a way to cross the raging current to the small island."
