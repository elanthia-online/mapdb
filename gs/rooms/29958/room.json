      "Several jagged stones, each as large as a small building, have fallen from the terrace above, heavily scoring the western wall of the fane.  Amidst the rubble, one span of ruined stonework is twined with crude but intricate runes that depict an undulating aurora framed by stylized stars.  The rock is corroded and pitted as if eaten by a caustic substance."
