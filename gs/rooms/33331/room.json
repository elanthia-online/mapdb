      "Burnished wooden floors span the length of the room, broken up by a thick rolton wool rug that rests in the center of the chamber.  The expanse of a large red oak bed is tucked away along a far wall and bordered by two tall modwir armoires.  A small black mithril brazier is nestled beneath a high wooden shelf, while a pair of old boots leans up against an open closet."
