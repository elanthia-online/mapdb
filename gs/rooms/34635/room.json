      "Rook Boulevard blends into the road encircling the citadel at the village's center.  Steepled manses give way to smaller homes and businesses content to huddle in the shadow of the walls around the central spire's base.  Near to the walls is a stand of strangler figs that have found hardy purchase in a craggy section of the greenway, their boles tangled about the corpses of trees they have consumed."
