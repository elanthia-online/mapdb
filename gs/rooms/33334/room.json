      "Wildly contorted spires of igneous rock explode from the sands of the beach.  The stone and sand are a study in contrasts; the former is blood-dark and craggy, while the latter is bright as diamonds and blessed with a surpassingly fine consistency.  Inland, the beach makes a reluctant segue into green grasses and wild growth, their green hues enhanced by the stormy sky's odd glow.  Catching droplets of crystal clear water, flowers in a variety of riotous hues border a steep path up the island's central spire."
