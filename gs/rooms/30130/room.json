      "Across a pitch black spruce gangplank, the main deck stretches out in both directions, from the bow to the stern of this massive warship, the wide oak planks gleaming in the sunlight a misty grey hemp sail billows from a wooden mast above the entrance to the cargo hold below, while a crows nest can be spotted high above.  The bulkheads are lined with cannons facing ports fitted with wooden hatches."
