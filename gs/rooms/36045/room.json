    "description": [
      "Lengths of fishing line are secured between twisted rafters overhead, dangling numerous small fish covered in salt and spices.  The floor of the ger is covered with woven reed mats, some stained with dry blood and others with various seasonings.  A pair of huge fish jawbones is adjoined in the center of the roof, where the rafters are secured to their large, jagged teeth.  Bright white walls of thick felt are well kept, with only a few lightly stained patches near a short wooden rack from the day-to-day toil."
