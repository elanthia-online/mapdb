      "Bathed in candlelight, a small round table of white birch rests within the shelter of painted screens.  Several stubby pillar candles encircle a white porcelain urn painted with wrens upon the smooth surface of the table, while a soft rug of lamb's wool provides a vibrant splash of verdant color to the area."
