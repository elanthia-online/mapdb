      "Water has eroded a hole through the rocks creating a natural bridge over the falls.  To the north lies a large, spring-fed pond of water, runoff from the mountains.   Water from the pond flows beneath the rock bridge and over the falls, creating a magnificent spectacle.  Looking out over the falls and pool below, sunlight on the mist creates a vibrant rainbow.",
