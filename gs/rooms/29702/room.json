      "A curious mixture of vivid green verdancy and gnomish gadgets pepper the tent's interior, lending an earthy, workshop coziness to the bustling sales environment.  Near the double-wide tent flap, which is tied open, a certificate-laden, gilded table sits next to a chalkboard informational sign and a giant cog and vine tortoise.  Several oak-inset fel displays circling the central tent pole offer wooden box contraptions fitted with stirrup irons, while the vine-wound racks ringing the outside present large, leaf-like constructs."
