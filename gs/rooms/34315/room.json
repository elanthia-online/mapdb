      "Dense clouds hang in the air with disorienting consequences until an abrupt flurry forces the misty mass to sail away, revealing an opportune glimpse of the muddy ground.  Dangerously close to the edge of the cliff, one miscalculated step could be the deciding factor between life and death.  A few powder blue feathers jut out from the wet dirt, primarily noticeable because of the utter color contrast from the drab brown path that leads away from the precipice."
