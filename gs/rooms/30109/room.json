      "Messy and cluttered, the wagon is piled with crates overflowing with various materials.  The interior of the wagon is crossed with a twisted labyrinth of piping that travels in and out of the walls.  Bits of jewelry and other items hang from the chaotic tangle of metal.  A small archway covered with a tattered blanket at the back of the space is barely visible through the jumbled mess."
