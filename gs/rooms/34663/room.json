      "Fine metal chains hang over the patio, suspending a series of glass lanterns.  Though unlit, they catch the daylight and refract it in a constellation of rainbowed shards that illuminate the surfaces of the round tables that occupy the patio.  A quiet but picturesque street runs along one side of the patio, while on the other, some glass-paneled doors lead into the rustic opulence of the restaurant."
