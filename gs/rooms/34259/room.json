      "Torrid humidity blankets the raised terrace, misting the curious stone construction with perspiration.  The steam is laden with a predominant acidic tang, but also holds the odor of minerals and damp earth.  Larvae inching their way across the ground seem undeterred by the harshness of the miasma, congregating in clumps as they form their dreadful chrysalises."
