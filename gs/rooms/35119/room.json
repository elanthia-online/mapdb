      "Cerulean silk banners hang to either side of the high arched entrance of the office, each sporting a horned crab clasping a red dagger.  Cold sunlight streams through the heavy panes of the curtained windows, pooling over the fine textiles upholstering a sumptuous fraelhan couch.  A regal reception desk looks down on the foyer, its dark wood boasting insets of ebony and rosewood."
