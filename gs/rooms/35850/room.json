      "A multihued rug from the north ends here, rounded and tasseled, where it matches an equally rounded room.  The shelf-laden wall curves almost entirely around a flame red twisted ironwood table that curves to match the symmetry between the rug and the wall on either of its sides.  To the west, a massive sword is displayed in an otherwise unfinished part of the dwelling."
