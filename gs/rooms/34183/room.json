      "Frayed ropes of rusty red-orange webbing cling to ridges in the scuffed stone and unfurl trailing filaments that flutter in the warm air.  Yellowish splatters discolor the steep slope of the tunnel floor, spreading into half-dried smears riddled with scraps of broken chitin and shreds of translucent, papery film in the descent to the southeast.  Further up the passage to the east, the faint gleam of reflected phosphorescence casts a blue sheen across the walls."
