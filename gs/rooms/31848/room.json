      "Tall leaf-framed mirrors stand on either side of a wall-to-ceiling rack wrought into climbing ivy vines, the display set against the back wall alongside a duo of vase-set pedestals.  A lone faenor wire mannequin stands at the opposite end of the room, its base weighed down by heavy bolts of fabric dyed in deep jewel tones.  A rose-draped chandelier hovers from above, the onyx-petaled flora engulfed in long tangled vines extending across the ceiling and through the varying components of the shop."
