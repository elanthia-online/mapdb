      "A worn track leads out onto the road to the southeast.  Thick weeds flank the edges of the track, keeping a distance of about six feet apart, but few of them attempt to invade the central ribbon.  To the north, a wooden barn, the only building in the area, stands out against the skyline.  All else seems to be weeds, rocks, road, or fields.  The plaintive bleating of roltons reverberates across the landscape, its source apparently somewhere to the northwest."
