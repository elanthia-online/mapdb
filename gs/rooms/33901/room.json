    "description": [
      "Ceiling-high windows are draped in a fall of onyx-petaled taerethil, the blooms arcing over the curved lattices framing the faenor-chained chandelier at the center of the shop.  A gilded cabinet of ebony stands behind an elongated glass-paneled counter, the surface encasing rows of pastries labeled with vellum placards and placed upon leaf-framed platters.  Nestled in the back corner is a nacre velvet curtain, partially concealing a spiraled flora-wrought staircase entwined with thin vines."
