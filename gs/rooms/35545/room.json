      "Smooth, damp walls enclose the secluded grotto as torchlight casts flickering shadows across the stone.  Along one edge, a dark and uneven narrow fissure splits the wall, while a small opening rests in the opposite corner.  A shucking oyster harvester sits on the side of a large pool occupying most of the chamber.  The water shifts gently within the basin, catching light in brief glints across its surface."
