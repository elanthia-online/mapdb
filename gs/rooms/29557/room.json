    "description": [
      "This room is framed with dark blue walls that encircle a floor of tongue and groove ash planks.  A large bed fills the far corner, set with round, stone grey pillows, a heavy pewter and blue-green quilt, and a tasseled bedskirt of teal and brown velvet, creating a quaint semblance of a river running past thin river reeds.  On the wall directly across from the bed is a riverstone fireplace, with a hammered silver bucket of sticks atop the hearth, and beside it is an old, but handsome writing desk."
