      "The room is a bustle of activity with clerks moving stacks of paper left and right for reasons you cannot begin to fathom.  A musty wood fragrance fills the air, somewhat reminiscent of an old log cabin filled with dust.  Just behind a low wooden desk sits a middle-aged halfling clerk who seems to be waiting impatiently for something."
