      "Leading away from the arch, the dirt path moves around a long teak hall covered with flowering vines on either side.  A pair of stone wildcats flank the entry to the main hall, their stone skin adorned with a lattice of vines dotted with colorful jungle flowers.  Sounds of swords and shields bashing mingle with the general noises of camaraderie that drift from deeper in the compound."
