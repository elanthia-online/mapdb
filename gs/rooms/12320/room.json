      "Crushed velvet carpets, thin and narrow, occupy the center of the floor where the northern and western corridors meet, their dark colors bleeding down the spiral stairs positioned within the curve of the white stucco wall.  Tiny sea glass charms are arranged in the railing and upon the ceilings, their oddly shaped pieces catching the sunlight from nearby windows and reflecting it upon the otherwise stark walls.",
