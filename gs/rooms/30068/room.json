      "A mostly untouched stretch of the once-grand hallway is free from infestation but for a few thick threads of silk clinging to the floor.  Beneath a tangle of copper inlay in the wall that resembles the dance of the aurora's wild light, a rounded pedestal rises out of the ground.  Sitting atop it, bathed in the faint luminescence of the chamber, is a crude golden chalice."
