    "description": [
      "Frayed hempen ropes cross overhead, lined with old cooking utensils and broken weapons that jangle as the ship rocks on the swell.  Some old wardrobes lean precariously along the starboard side of this mid-sized ship, while mounds of stained canvas bags line the port.  Stacked on edge horizontally, unhinged doors of faded colors line the very back of the stern.  Amidst the clutter a hatch can be seen that leads down into the depths of the hull."
