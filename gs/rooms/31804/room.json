      "A rectangular wren-etched mirror stands behind a deep basin of ashen porcelain, the circular bowl filled with opaque black water, with the contents threatening to spill across an ebonwood table against the wall.  A claw-footed tub is nestled by a curtained window, its shattered lip stained in rusty crimson rivulets splayed across the surface.  Web-like cracks have formed in the upper corners of the room, covering the emerald-colored walls in dark fractures."
