      "The silhouette of an imposing, stone-built mansion rises above an overgrown garden covering the expansive lawn, the wide pathway framed by distorted topiaries looming over the shattered cobblestones.  A broken marble-crafted fountain stands at the center of the walkway, the cracked basin covered in a curtain of blackened moss.  Gnarled vines engulf the imposing iron and vaalin gate, the spear-tipped finials impaling the decaying sanguine roses ensnaring the framework, leaving the twisted metal stained in dull red."
