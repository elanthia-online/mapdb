      "The parapets are topped with helmets of various races, each helm painted with a mock face.  Sloping down and away from the steep stairs behind, the cobblestone wall widens dramatically ahead.  A row of oak buckets lines the base of the wall, each containing a long wooden ladle and filled with scum-topped water."
