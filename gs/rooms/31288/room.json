      "A polished brass lantern brightens the wagon, directly above a large sign that greets customers upon entry.  A small glass case, secured with iron fittings, casts prismatic light across the makeshift ironwood shelving.  Nestled above an oak table, the contents of a glass-topped ruic cabinet glisten softly in the ambient light beside a latticework divider."
