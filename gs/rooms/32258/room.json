      "The passage ends in an obsidian wall, its facade carved with a countenance that is, in itself, ghastly visage, demonic in nature, with a yawning maw that reveals razor-sharp teeth and a forked tongue.  Horns crown the being's head, wings rise large and menacing over its shoulders, and a disturbing hybridization of clawed tentacles coil along the lower edge."
