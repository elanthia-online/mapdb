      "Storax trees cast long shadows over a fenced shipyard.  Moonlight illuminates the area, with the wooden hulls creating dramatic silhouettes.  A calm settles over the shipyard, contrasting with the daytime hustle and bustle.  Starlight spills through carob and apricot trees that line a street to southwest, causing the cobbles to wear dabbled shadows."
