      "Two heavy linked iron chains slip through a series of pulleys and wrap around a huge windlass, all covered in a heavy layer of grease and grime.  A number of curious dark small holes pierce the ceiling of the entry area.  Past a closed and rusted out black iron portcullis is an open central courtyard, while an old oak drawbridge leads back out towards the merchant road."
