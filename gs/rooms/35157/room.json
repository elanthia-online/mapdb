      "Bronze-bowled braziers dot the corridor, their brightly burning coals adding warmth to the air and providing a companionable glow that illuminates the russet-painted walls.  Carved support posts flank a set of descending steps steps to the west that lead into the open-air tavern, while opposite a grey-washed white oak door provides access to one of the inn's rooms."
