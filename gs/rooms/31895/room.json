      "A variety of twilight and celestial-themed knickknacks adorn the walls and decorate the fabrics chosen for this shop.  A narrow window with drawn moon and stars curtains adorns the eastern wall.  Empty doorframes leading into other rooms hint at this building's previous function as a house, although it is unclear how long ago the conversion took place."
