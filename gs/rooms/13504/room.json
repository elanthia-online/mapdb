    "description": [
      "Beautifully landscaped, this courtyard is surrounded on three sides by a low stone wall and on the fourth by a half-timbered grey stone house.  A copse of deringo trees grows near the wall, shading a low stone bench.  A mottled grey and brown stone walkway leads from a single arched opening in the stone wall.  It meanders across the wooded grounds and melds with three grey stone steps leading to the simple carved oak door at the front of the house."
