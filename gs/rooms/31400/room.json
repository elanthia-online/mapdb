      "Flowing with urgency, the stream empties into a dark, ominous cavity.  The water's roar is deafening, drowning all sounds from the enveloping forest.  Sharp and jagged rocks along the water's edge create a protective barrier from a fatal plunge into the cavern's depths.  The heavy growth to the south has become impenetrable."
