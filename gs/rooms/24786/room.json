      "This southern corridor dead ends with a circular room made entirely of oak with three north facing doors.  Standing eight feet tall, a petrified oak door is flanked by an ironbound and an oak door.  Rough-hewn oaken walls surround you, each prominently displaying different types of well-used weapons ranging from claidhmores to falchions and halberds."
