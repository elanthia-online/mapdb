      "Much of the rock has been chipped away here, creating a cavern that is as large as any you can recall seeing.  The floor is covered with a thick layer of dust, though it sparkles oddly in the light cast by a torch set set into one wall.  Every so often, a few crumbled bits of rock cascade down the western wall, rolling down the steep incline that angles so sharply to the southeast."
