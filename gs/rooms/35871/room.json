      "The cobblestone path of the promenade divides and weaves between colorful dwellings and varied merchant stalls, adjoining a row of stone houses to the south, a small market to the east, and a magnificent fountain to the north.  Constantly falling grey ash has been pushed into small piles at each corner, either intentionally or by the heavy amount of traffic moving through the area."
