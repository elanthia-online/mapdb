      "Alternating dark and light wood paneling encloses the darkly lit small room filled with the scent of fresh tobacco lingering in the air.  A glass display case fills the northern wall of the shop, boasting neatly layered rows of cigars and fresh tobacco jars, while a matching display counter exhibits the shop's various pipes and pipe tobacco options."
