      "Gritty limestone steps descend into this ancient mausoleum, where the floor is scattered with a variety of bones; some human, others not.  Near an alcove shelf, some pitted brass hooks are suspended from a far, nearly intact wall, rising adjacent to a dark tunnel leading to the north and deeper within."
