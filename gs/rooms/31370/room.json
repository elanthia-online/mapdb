      "Broad and naturally level, the plateau affords a breathtaking panoramic view of the shadowed valley beyond.  A chill wind whips across the expanse of granite, which is offset by the rising spires of the estate's roofline as it ascends the mountainside from below.  A scrollworked copper gate provides entry to a formal garden placed just opposite of the conservatory, while a crystal walkway curls around low stone terraces outside the structure before descending along the cliffside."
