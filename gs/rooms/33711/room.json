      "Suspended from lofty, spreading branches overhead, great pendulous nests have been repurposed into comfortable seating, each lined with down-filled, silken pillows.  A firebowl carved from a half moon of rock is positioned in the center of the open air parlor.  Beyond the corner of the octagonal wooden platform, an arched passageway of intertwining lianas frames a picturesque waterfall fringed with bracken."
