      "Thick bamboo stems make up the roof, pillars, and backside of this cozy beach office.  Long gauzy silk draperies fall from the overhead framework and lay pooled along the outer edges of the soft white sand floor, partially obscuring the expansive ocean view.  Sounds of the waves rolling just outside quietly filter in, punctuated with the occasional seagulls cry."
