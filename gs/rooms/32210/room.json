      "Pristine white-washed walls are illuminated by evenly spaced sconces that create a warm, pale yellow light that spreads throughout the shop.  Bright white curtains embroidered with cows and roltons decorate the windows, while a long service counter is skirted with brick red linen and decorated with black and white chickens.  Standing across from one another, a tall storage shelf offers dry goods and an insulated ice chest houses dairy items."
