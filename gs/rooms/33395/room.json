      "Reinforced shelves flank the entry, stocked with rolls of bandages and small, well-sharpened tools, the bundles of supplies placed close to the enclosures.  Various jars of raw chrysoprase are placed at the center of the table, the gemstones casting subtle green shades across the dark-inked parchment scattered across the surface.  An herb-embroidered curtain partially conceals the window-inset door at the back of the area, the fabric loosely draped over a blackboard angled in the corner."
