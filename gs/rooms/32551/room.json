      "The wood-planked walls of the wagon are covered in hand-penned parchments and sheets of vellum, interspersed with colorful sketchings and watercolor renderings framed in bamboo.  Several blanket-cradled containers are nestled between curios filled with knickknacks, each piece of furniture adorned with a variety of faded stamps."
