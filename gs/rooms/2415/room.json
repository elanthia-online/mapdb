      "Wedged into a cramped walk between two tall buildings, the alley slumbers in shadow.  The brick wall behind a stack of empty crates is scrawled with an ugly symbol in dark brown pigment that looks like a harpy wreathed by a burning ring.  Soft scuttling resounds from within the crates.  Despite the unappealing locale, a grungy little shop does brisk business near the midpoint of the alleyway.",
      "Wedged between two sturdy stone buildings, the alley is blanketed with shadows.  A stack of empty crates leans against one wall, from which a quiet scuttling noise can be heard."
