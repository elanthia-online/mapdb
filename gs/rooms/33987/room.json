      "Ceiling-high bookcases are filled with gilt-leafed volumes and tomes, the rigid leather spines covered in a veil of dust-riddled webbing spanning across the library.  A stained mahogany ladder leans against the far wall, the bottom rungs half-buried with a haphazard pile of books and scrolls, the copper-tinged ink bleeding across the margins.  An antler-mounted plaque has been affixed above the red-stained entryway, the sharpened tines dangling in broken angles along the doorframe."
