      "Colorful pavilions of silk and canvas line the grass-covered walkway, the greenery being slowly consumed by a variety of animals meandering by the otter-shaped fountain in the center of the neighborhood.  Wooden-framed easels are scattered amid the chaos of mammals, the canvases propped up next to several chalk-colored chairs."
