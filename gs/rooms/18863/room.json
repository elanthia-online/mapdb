      "Roses in full-bloom entwine themselves around ornate trellises, their petals shifting softly in the whispering breeze.  The pathway spirals inward, its edges lined with countless bushes, each offering up a unique flower unlike any other in the garden.  Lilies, tulips, roses and daisies all combine to offer up a heady aroma that soothes the soul.  In the center of the garden stands a large gazebo, inviting you to stay a while."
