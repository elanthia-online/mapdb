      "Snowflake patterns of frost coat the windows, giving a fractured view of the outside world.  A large couch piled high with furs sits almost dangerously close to a pot-bellied woodstove, and a pair of snowshoes hangs on the wall.  Carefully labeled scrolls fill a shelf at the back, behind a massive oak desk with clawed feet."
