      "Smooth dirt spreads across the circular clearing, its surface packed firm and traced with faint imprints of past visitors.  White marble pillars rise just south, their floral-plinth bases forming a quiet threshold to the colonnade beyond.  Northeast, a pebbled pathway of blue shale and red marl curves into the dense tangle of laurel, cypress, tamarisk, and juniper, vanishing beneath shifting layers of shade.  Near the edge, a rustic traveller's wagon stands beneath a canvas awning, marked by the scent of pigment and oil."
