      "Evenly spaced recesses in the inner and outer bulkheads house sparse bunks stacked two high.  Stowed beneath the lowermost of each pair of bunks is a set of foot lockers, shut and padlocked.  There is little opportunity for privacy in the cramped living space, a fact complicated by the narrow archway leading out onto the main deck."
