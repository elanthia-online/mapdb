      "Curving sharply, the path doubles back on itself, dipping southeast beneath a break in the canopy and curling south toward a distant convergence of pathways.  Light spills unevenly through the opening above, pooling across roots, fallen needles, and struggling saplings.  At the curve's heart rises an oak of impossible age, its trunk split down the center into twin columns.  From one sturdy limb hangs an ancient swing, its seat carved from a weathered branch and suspended by ropes braided of coarse grass."
