      "The lane to the east leads into the heart of town and the main square.  Pedestrians and carts laden down with cargo make their way along the road.  The back wall of the grocer's shop borders the road, its wide door surrounded by piles of rough gunny sacks and stacks of wooden crates, some empty, others still to be unpacked.",
