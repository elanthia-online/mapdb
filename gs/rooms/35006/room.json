      "Sheer and sharp, cliffs of black volcanic stone rise over the southern beaches of the island.  Though severe, the cliffs are far from lifeless.  Tufts of hardy red tundra grass grow in profusion near a narrow path that plummets steeply toward the shores below.  Nesting birds, from murres to auklets, make their nests in cracks and crevices in the natural stone walls, and their droppings have stained the rock white in places, like splatters of paint on a huge canvas."
