      "Bare stone curves into an oval chamber beneath a vaulted ceiling, its surfaces scarred with uneven tallies and spiraling gouges.  Bolted to the center of the floor is a heavy iron chair with corroded manacles, while barred display cases and rust-pitted lockers line the walls with secured wares.  Overhead, warped mirrors and a swaying lantern scatter distorted reflections in restless patterns."
