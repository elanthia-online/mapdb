      "Brightly colored awnings sway and flutter in the transient arctic breezes, the ropes that anchor them to nearby support posts creaking and groaning when they pull against their bindings.  White picket fences stretch along the east and west, forming an encircling pen in the thick blue-green grasses of a rolling glade.  Small mounds of stubborn snow cling to the footings at the entrance gates."
