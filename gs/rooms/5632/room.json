      "A lone, grass-covered hilltop, crowned by a ring of healthy oak trees, rises high above the bog to the east of the path.  This unlikely hill seems strangely out of place in the decaying bog, and seems pleasant and inviting.  Progress toward the hill is barred, however, as the eastern edge of the path crumbles away underfoot, threatening to dump travelers into the bog."
