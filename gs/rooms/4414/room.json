      "A worn rug covers the floor of this cavern, and the rock walls have been chiseled smooth.  Strung along one wall is a length of mithril chain displaying assorted blades, while a solid wooden stand and an enameled white rack occupy opposite corners.  A long marble slab sits in the center of the cavern."
