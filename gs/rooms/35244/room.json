      "Revealing a trellis covered in climbing roses, the twisting turns of the garden are filled with a medley of scents.  Succulents line the edges of the path, their thick leaves and varied shapes providing texture amid white and grey pebbles.  A carved stone birdhouse hangs from a tree branch, and an antique wooden wheelbarrow brims with blooming flowers freshly transplanted to the space."
