      "A soft murmur fills the room as a few patrons mill about, their footfalls dampened by the plush midnight green carpeting.  Bronze half-moon wall sconces project light towards the ceiling, bathing the room in a muted glow.  A white-robed elven attendant stands behind a dark maple desk, occasionally scribbling something on a small stack of parchments.  Spaced evenly around the room are number of large cabinets filled with towels."
