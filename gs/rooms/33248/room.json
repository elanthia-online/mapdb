      "Surrounded by darkness, dampness and the smell of mildew, you find yourself cutoff from the light and life of the town somewhere above.  An occasional heavy footstep overhead breaks the silence but the muddy walls quickly dampen the sound.  It seems this is not meant to be a comfortable place and you are soon totally damp as the floor seems to be mostly muddy water.  There is nothing to do now but wait."
