      "The trail ends at a rose-veined white marble arch laid into the side of the mountain, its pale hue marking it immediately as distinct from the surrounding stone.  Narrow slits in the surrounding rock face are paned with stained glass, indicating that the mountainside is the facade of a small stronghold.  An engraved golden ora plaque gleams through the snow and ice from a smoothed plane of stone to the right of the entryway."
