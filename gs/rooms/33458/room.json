      "Armless chairs upholstered in spruce green distressed velvet are arranged in a semicircle around a white oak table brimming with sewing supplies.  Tiny pins with colored heads lay scattered about the floor, and thin strips of fraying material dangle along the edge of a nearly full wastebasket.  A full-length mirror sits next to a console table prepared with a modest selection of treats."
