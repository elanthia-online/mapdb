      "A glinting blanket of snow covers the tall ironwood trunks along the periphery of the encampment, the rope-secured barricades spaced with iron-caged braziers forged into vertical tusks.  Frost-covered barrels sit clustered across the straw-strewn dirt, the makeshift seating encircling the pole-framed bonfire contained between the weathered rocks set in a wide circle.  Steady light radiates from the flag-adorned structures at the back of the encampment as a steady stream of cooking smoke rises above."
