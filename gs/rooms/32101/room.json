      "Tables littered with spare parts, marked cards, and random bits of miscellany line two of the four walls in this small backroom, while several mismatched stools and chairs sit scattered about.  A partially clean worktable is tucked into one corner, and a multihued glass bowl of hard candies rests on its edge."
