      "Shadows dance across the steeply sloped, golden sand dunes that develop then become compacted as the beach transitions into rugged cliffs to the northwest.  Shafts of hazy moonlight break through the large trees that edge the sand to the north, the vegetation slowly changing to bare scrub as it nears the rocky coastal terrain.  Piles of driftwood, cast aside by the fickle ocean, lay randomly about the dark, seaweed-strewn shore.",
      "Steeply sloped, golden sand dunes develop then become compacted as the beach transitions into rugged cliffs to the northwest.  Large trees edge the sand to the north, the leafy vegetation slowly changing to bare scrub as it reaches the rocky coastal terrain.  Rolling in the surf, a pile of seaweed serves as a trap for any of the stray logs used as the sea's playthings.  Piles of driftwood, cast aside by the fickle ocean, lay strewn about the shore."
