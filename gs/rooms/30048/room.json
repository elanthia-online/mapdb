      "Infestation has induced a terrible transformation in the wide hall, which looks to have been some sort of treasury.  The double doors are missing entirely and the aperture they guarded has corroded into a ragged acid-pocked gash.  Strings of ichorous gunk hang from the ceiling, dripping unsavory substances that smell vaguely of lizard.  The tang of it chokes the space."
