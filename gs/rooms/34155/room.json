      "Rising out of the smooth-worn floor of the tunnel is a massive mineral column as big around as a mighty oak.  It spreads into thick branches as it reaches the ceiling of the cavern before finally merging with the darker stone there.  Veins of the same pale stone wind through the walls of ubiquitous black granite.  Despite the stillness of the air currents, faint snatches of a scent like stale vinegar waft through the air in unpleasant drifts."
