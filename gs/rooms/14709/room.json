      "This large, circular room is surmounted by an elaborately decorated dome.  Frescos cover the ceiling with images of battles and celebrations alike.  A massive dragon skeleton hangs overhead, suspended by unseen means.  Over three tall archways leading to metal-adorned vestibules, a bleached dragon skull is mounted, its sightless eyes staring at its comrade."
