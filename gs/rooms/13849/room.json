      "The huge chamber is filled with detritus of all kinds, from large complex contraptions to a thick conglomeration of bits and pieces, all of which defy identification.  Chains in a variety of thicknesses hang in a loopy tangle from the ceiling, snarled with an array of ropes and pulleys.  A long workbench covers the far wall, strewn with tools of every description.  The most notable thing about the whole mess is that everything, barring the rope, is made of mithril."
