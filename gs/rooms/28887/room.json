      "Moonlight and cool air drifts over the sandy dunes where tufts of grass obscure the ocean view, though it does little for the sound of the lapping waves.  Sand clutters the southern edges of the cobblestone street, the pale dust collecting around the various lanterns set at even intervals.  Fresh paint decorates a sprawling structure built within a white fence and manicured lawns, a painted sign above the entry proclaiming it as \"Sailor's Solace.\"  Situated in the curve of a fork in the road is a dark-shingled white oak shop.",
