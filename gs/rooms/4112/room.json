      "The steep hills of this area rise suddenly and become the steep walls of a narrow canyon to the south.  Scores of tiny caves riddle the slopes of this region, all much too small to allow you to enter.  A large number of animal tracks crisscross the dry floor here and seem to lead to and from the natural dens created by the caves."
