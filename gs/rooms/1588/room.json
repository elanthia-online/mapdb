      "Whether by chance or by design, this end of the street is filled with drinking revellers and a trio of bards engaged in an improptu performance.  A beer vendor has parked his cart to partially block the court from the intersection to the east, but whether he was the instigator of this little celebration or just an opportunist is unclear."
