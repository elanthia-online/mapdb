      "Stone walls encircle this small area, rising fifty feet or more straight up.  The ceiling appears to be some sort of latticework or mesh that barely allows any illumination through.  All along the expanse of wall a hundred misshapen shelves extend out to hold one long white candle apiece, creating a tunnel of flickering stars ascending toward a softly glowing moon.  On a wide pedestal in the room's center fifty candles of all shapes and sizes cluster, igniting and extinguishing one at a time."
