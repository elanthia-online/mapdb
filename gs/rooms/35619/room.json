      "To either side of a corroded hatch, shelves bowed by exposure to the brine hold waterlogged remains of books whose pages have fused together in a messy mishmash.  They hang above the crumpled remains of the captain's bunk, which is a mess of moldy fabric and sodden wood.  A carved compass rose in the forward bulkhead spreads from a narrow hatch that has rusted shut, barring access to a secondary hold near the bow of the ship.  Seawater trickles from the surrounding planks and runs along the floor in rivulets."
