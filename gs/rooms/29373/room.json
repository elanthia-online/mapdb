      "Oak sideboards set with an arrangement of glass-covered platters and trays, along with some covered wide-lipped bowls, stand along the circumference of this small area, and the scent of vinegar lingers in the air.  A green-curtained window on the back wall stands open just a bit to let in a breath of fresh air."
