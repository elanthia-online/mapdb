      "Filament-strung lanterns are scattered across the leaf-engulfed ceiling of the shop, the spherical glass decorated in tiny greenish gold fireflies cut from arathiel.  Oversized blades of leather-cut grass encircle a fine-grained dark walnut counter at the center of the room, the bottom trim of the wood carved in metallic-painted ladybugs and gilt-winged bumblebees resting on the flora-intaglio panels."
