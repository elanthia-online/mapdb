      "Creeper vines crawl across the ground occupying nearly every available space of dirt, their seeking tendrils gripping the granite wall but finding no purchase.  A solitary bird's nest fashioned of twigs manages to maintain its balance upon the wrought iron spikes driven into the nearby bulwark despite the efforts of the harsh winds.",

      "Heavy iron chains are scattered across the ground, their broken links impeded in the dirty cobblestones of the pathway.  Whistling and howling winds cause the clouds above to race through the moonlight at a quickened pace creating shadows that rise and fall at odd intervals throughout the area.  The sound of gravel skipping over metal fills the air."
