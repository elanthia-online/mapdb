      "Age-worn brass and copper spears are shackled inside of an elongated crystalline case in an elegant formation amid a varied assortment of ancient coins and tools.  Erupting in sporadic intervals from the periphery, a quivering hiss rises to a fever pitch and is quickly silenced by a reverberating thud.  A lengthy, gently curving path cuts cleanly through the leftover gritty rubble of a crumbling sandstone wall."
