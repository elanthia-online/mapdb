      "It is dim inside the shop, but not dark.  Glimaerstone lamps are hung along the walls, their light trained on a number of glass display cases arranged around the large room.  The cases are mostly empty, though there are half a dozen items within them, mostly trinkets and baubles of little apparent value.  The floor is covered in a rich wall-to-wall carpet the color of burgundy wine, and a velvet curtain of the same color masks a doorway leading eastward."
