      "Bright pink muhly grass spreads its feathery stalks around several palm trees along the southern edges of the street, the bristles all but hiding a winding path that leads to a small promontory.  The northwestern section of the road is clotted with warehouse and custom buildings, their terracotta roofs a bright contrast to their whitewashed faces, while to the northeast a sprawling shipyard with heavy pulley systems and high fences dominates the road."
