      "Rising from a natural stone fountain set into northern wall, the sound of trickling water provides a backdrop of pleasant crystalline music to the bustling space, feeding an overgrown tangle of iceblossoms in a curved planter at the base.  Next to the burbling font, a chiseled marble arch leads into the mayor's office suit.  A stern halfling guard watches over the area, her posture tense despite the calming surroundings."
