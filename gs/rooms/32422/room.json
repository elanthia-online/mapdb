      "A vast, deep ravine severs the highlands on which the city sits from the high hills dominated by the castle.  Joining them is a sinuous bridge of pale stone, a masterwork of architecture and stonecraft.  Flecks of mica in the stonework gleam brightly in the daylight, engulfing the bridge in a nimbus of reflected light."
