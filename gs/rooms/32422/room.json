      "A vast, deep ravine severs the highlands on which the city sits from the high hills dominated by the castle.  Joining them is a sinuous bridge of pale stone, a masterwork of architecture and stonecraft.  Flecks of mica in the stonework glint sharply in the moonlight, twinkling like stars against the dark silhouette of the bridge.",

Flecks of mica in the stonework gleam brightly in the daylight, engulfing the bridge in a nimbus of reflected light."
