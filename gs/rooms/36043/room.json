      "Goat-hide walls stretch across the criss-crossed khana, held firm by belly bands while the continuity of the ger broken only by a tied door frame.  Rafters rise into the central roof ring above cases and stacked crates along the curved walls.  Copper lanterns hang from rafter joints, and a woven carpet covers the packed ground next to a blanket-draped archway."
