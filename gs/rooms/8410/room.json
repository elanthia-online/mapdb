      "Perfectly round and suffused with an eery unnatural light, the room serves as a hub to a wheel of corridors surrounding it.  Glyphs, carved and smudged with soot, almost stand out and writhe in the odd lighting.  A slightly raised stone platform with blackened arrows pointing off in all directions sits in the focal point, emitting a strange hum."
