      "A circular table carved from gilt-veined marble dominates the mahogany-planked room, its surface covered with a small scale model of Elanthia and its waterways.  Iron-framed windows flank an antiqued gold telescope, leaving a pair of tall leather-backed chairs to hold back the heavy curtains fashioned of faded pirate flags.  A collection of weaponry is displayed above an unadorned slate fireplace, the mantle stacked with nautical charts and volumes."
