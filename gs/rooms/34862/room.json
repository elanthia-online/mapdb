      "A wide wooden gate, painted in shades of blue and white, offers both entrance to and egress from this lush garden.  A shaded path of packed dirt and pebble-sized gemstones winds into a dense garden of delicate ferns and gently waving grasses.  The tops of colorful mushrooms peek from between their greener neighbors, welcoming visitors with inviting splashes of soft crimson, vivid violet, and lemon yellow spots."
