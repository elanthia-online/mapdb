      "Sturdy red cedar trellises are attached to the wall upon either side of a pair of double doors, their mahogany lattices laden with the thickly corded vines of flower-laden wisteria.  Heavy shadows lay across the path from the catwalk above, though several rays of sunlight manage to sneak through the thick foliage to illuminate the crushed white seashells of the pathways as they meander towards other sections of the garden.",
