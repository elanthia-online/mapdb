      "The trailway comes to an end at the base of the sheer black cliffs overlooking the beach.  A narrow path ascends through a break in the cliffs, offering a steep ascent to the clifftops.  Bird nests crowd every nook and cranny in the rock face, their occupants filling the air with shrill cries and song."
