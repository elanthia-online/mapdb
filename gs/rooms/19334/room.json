      "Intertwining ivy and wisteria blossoms frame large, stained-glass windows, their panes radiating a rainbow of color across the room.  The foliage sweeps across the remaining walls revealing numerous, half-hidden niches holding potions, exotic plants and specimens.  A sylvan rug covers the floor in front of a black onyx fireplace, its richly patterned surface topped with a soft pyramid of silk pillows.  However, it is the hearth that draws one's eye with its intricate carvings of dragons in various poses."
