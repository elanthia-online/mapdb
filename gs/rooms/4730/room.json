      "Broken yellowed cobblestones meander among the dense woods, half lost in the creeping tendrils and fallen leaves of the forest floor.  Overhead, the sky is barely visible through the heavy shadows created by overgrown oak trees.  Hidden amongst the thick foliage in the uppermost branches, a dark thing moves slightly, watching from above.",
