      "The air is almost uncomfortably hot and steam roils around you with every movement.  Just large enough to fit one long wooden bench, the room is designed to accommodate only one person at a time.  Near the door is a bucket of water and a brazier containing smooth stones, their surfaces split from rapid heating and cooling."
