      "Deep shade pools beneath towering thuja and cypress, their dense branches enclosing a secluded patio of smooth stone tiles.  Along the western edge, colorful ribbons stretch from the colonnade's roof to the treetops, their cobalt blue, yellow, and white strands rippling in the rising heat.  Flames dance within iron braziers, casting flickering light over the gathered sturdy chairs.  Shadows shift across the stone as embers crackle softly.  To the south, an arch of rambling roses spills dark blossoms over iron lattices."
