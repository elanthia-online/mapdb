      "Two large totems of snow-covered ice stand here, side by side, before a large snowy hill.  They have been carved from the ice in shapes too intricate for the shrieking wind to have made and tower twenty feet into the air, as if marking this place, or posting a warning.  You shiver, not entirely from the cold, at the implication that something that large might not want you here.",
