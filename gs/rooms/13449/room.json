    "description": [
      "Scratch marks cover the walls of the tunnels, signature marks of creatures intent on expanding this underground haven.  The floor of the tunnel seems to be composed of a mixture of dirt, pebbles and crushed bits of animal bone.  No doubt the carnivorous animals living in the woods have used the tunnels as a handy dining chamber for many years."
