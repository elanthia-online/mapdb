      "Bright white seashells create a path to and from this section of the garden, their mother-of-pearl bellies glisten brightly in the golden sunlight.  Nestled amongst the verdant, flower-laden vines of tropical plants is a pair of high-backed benches that are carved with bas-relief images.  A series of blown glass hummingbird feeders dangle from wrought iron chains that are connected to the limbs of an enormous redwood tree that towers past the scattered roofs of the inn.",
