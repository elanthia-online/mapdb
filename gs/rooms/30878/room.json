      "Massive cedar planks stretch wall to wall, covered in places by various tanned hides.  Portals cut into the tree walls, some perhaps old knots, allow light to filter in from outside.  A basalt fireplace and chimney rest in the center of one wall.  A large metal grate rests horizontally across the fireplace, forming a grill for some impromptu cooking."
