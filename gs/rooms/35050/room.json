      "North of the road, the ugly, crooked bars of a spade-tipped barbed steel gate cast nebulous shadows in the pale moonlight.  Judging from the cracks in the tenebrous basalt walls and the pitting and rust scarring the bars, the metalwork is a relic of a time long past.  Large carts with wide beds are stationed outside, drawn by huge aurochs.  The placid beasts seem disquieted, as if by the ghost of an old scent on the frigid air."
