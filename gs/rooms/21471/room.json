      "The heavy green suede ceiling of this roomy tent is held aloft by a series of thin, pliable tree limbs woven in a circular pattern through the more sturdy overall structure that is the main support.  A central pole peaks the tent, and several poles at the edges define the walls that enclose this area.  Bundled herbs hang from above, lending their scent to the air as they dry, while nearby white paper lanterns shed a warm, diffuse light over the surroundings."
