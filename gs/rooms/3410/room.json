      "A vast and peaceful courtyard surrounds the crystal tower bordered by a stone wall.  Engulfed by clinging ice-coated vines that create a large frozen mosaic on the wall are a white birch branch message board and a heavy slate blackboard.  Almost hidden by the vines, a staircase spirals upward against the central tower, while a massive white modwir-framed entryway stands as the obvious entrance, with a granite monument placed nearby.  An ice-covered pond dominates one corner of the courtyard.",
