      "Soft, sand stretches beneath the cavern, where winding paths curve between vibrant coral outcroppings in hues of rose, amber, and violet.  Lunebloom coralweed clings to the base, its pale fronds unfurling like petals in slow motion, each tipped with a faint silvery glow.  Gently waving with the current, the plants form soft, moonlit halos along the edges of the walkways, casting dappled light across the swirling schools of fish that pass overhead."
