      "A tremendous tree spirals upward in the middle of the main path, which forks to either side, and its crooked trunk is as gnarled and curved as the spine of an old man contorted by age.  Thick, heavy vines that seem more wood than verdure climb into its dense canopy and knot themselves amidst the limbs, though the entirety of the tree is so massive that the effort seems entirely futile."
