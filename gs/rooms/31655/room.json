      "The wide bases of pumpkin ash trees line the river's edge, limbs laden with seeds, while beneath grow mushrooms of such unusual size that their presence strains the limits of rational existence.   Nevertheless, there they stand, stems too wide for a giantman to wrap his arms around and caps more than spacious enough to shelter several people from any rainstorm.  Several stems stand bereft of their heads, while several stacks of inverted caps rest near the river's edge."
