      "Bars for a wooden capstan are stacked neatly alongside heaps of coiled rope ready to be wound around its wooden drum and to the anchor beneath the ship.  Atop a small platform, a sea blue ironwood wheel takes pride of place at the ships helm below the mizzenmast, just a stones throw away from a wooden door leading to the captain's quarters."
