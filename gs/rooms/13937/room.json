      "Polished hoarbeam floors stretch uninterrupted from wall to wall, their natural grain accenting the rustic walls.  In the center of the room, an intricate pattern of mahogany is inlaid into the wooden floor, adding a bit of flair to an otherwise plain room.  To one side, a pair of bamboo and reed couches face each other across a glass-topped tree stump coffee table.  A tall linden arch in the back wall leads further into the structure."
