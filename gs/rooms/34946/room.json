      "The wooden planks of this section of the boardwalk are discolored with crimson stains from fresh catches brought ashore.  Multiple market stalls set between driftwood crates frame the area.  Gaps in the wood below afford brief glimpses of clear azure waters over white sand, with bits of kelp concealing bright, darting schools of fish.  The entire scene is overhung by a bright multihued sailcloth canopy with stitching of nautical imagery and a series of forged metal lanterns."
