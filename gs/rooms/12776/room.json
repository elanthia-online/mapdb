      "The trail curves sharply to the northeast, circling jagged stone perimeters and sidling along gullied rents.  Loose shale creates a downward slide south of that, where large, irregularly configured knives of stone stick up out of the scree here and there as the decline disappears into the gloom.  A low hissing can be heard, the sound of steam escaping from unseen fissures elsewhere in the cavern.  It rises and falls in volume, like gusts of wind sighing around a closed window during a storm."
