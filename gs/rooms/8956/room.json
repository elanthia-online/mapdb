      "Peeling paint and highly polished brass fittings make conflicting statements about the opulence that the area was known for in earlier times.  Circular windows and stained glass on some of the buildings look to be \"borrowed\" from a church.  Ice covers some of the window clasps, effectively sealing the openings shut."
