    "description": [
      "Wide planks of pitch-covered larch stretch from a companionway to the ornately carved figurehead gracing the bowsprit.  A large coil of tarred hemp rope lies at the base of a thick mast that rises twenty feet in the air.  A crow's nest is perched at the very top of the mast and has a commanding view of the moon glinting off the waves.  An ironwood gangway is positioned between a gap in the low railing."
