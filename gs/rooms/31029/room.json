      "Streamers in bright colors stretch across the ceiling, their unfettered ends falling down the walls to pool in a jumble upon the lacquered floorboards.  Tiny pieces of paper and discarded streamers drift across the reflective planks in the slight breeze that trickles in through the partially open door.  They collect against a lower counter that separates a pleasant shopkeeper from the front of the shop.  A trio of pillars support the weight of a wide blue glass bowl, a deep ruby red glass bowl, and an opaque grey glass bowl, respectively."
