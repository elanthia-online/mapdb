      "The inside of the wagon hosts an assortment of goods and minimal furniture arranged into organized chaos.  Windowless, the interior is lit by a pair of ceiling-mounted crystals, radiating enough illumination to see featured merchandise, but not enough to detail the messy perimeter.  Abutting a random pile of items stands a collapsible monir crate on a retractable mount, jutting out from a like-sized floor opening.  A couple feet above the crate, a braided hemp string dangles from a lightweight hook."
