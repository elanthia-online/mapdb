      "In front of a long wooden counter, faded and threadbare rugs are scattered over a hard-packed dirt floor.  Various cobbling tools hang from nails and spikes driven into oaken walls, while an assortment of broken shoe forms are piled high in one corner beside an open battered trunk.  A broken crate sits at the foot of a narrow staircase leading to a small loft."
