      "Sturdy floor-to-ceiling shelving filled with books and folios organized by subject matter line the walls of the room.  Atop a thick wool rug in the center of the room sits a dark byssine-lined chair and a grand mahogany desk covered in neatly organized papers and trays containing various alchemical apparatuses.  Above, a polished gold lantern hangs from a decorative canopy that has been inlaid with various gemstone constellations."
