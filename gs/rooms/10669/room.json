      "In a wide brick hearth, a bright and merry fire burns a roast to a crisp, sending thick black smoke up the chimney and filling the room with a sharp, foul odor.  Resting on some shelves nearby, a variety of jars and baskets contain various herbs and spices.  A small table pushed up against the brick interior wall functions as a butcher's block, judging from the deep cuts that have been hacked and slashed into the dark-stained wood."
