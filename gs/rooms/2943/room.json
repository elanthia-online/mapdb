      "A solitary stall toward the rear of the stables is occupied by a braying, white-muzzled mule.  The creature makes more noise than the half-dozen horses quartered next to it.  Hanging from the rafters above is an arrangement of wild roses and garlic, swaying slightly in the still air.",
      "Motes of dust float gently in shafts of light streaming into the stable through great holes torn from the thatched ceiling.  The hard-packed floor is littered with molding straw, from which puffs of dust arise with one's every movement."
