      "Glistening in the ambient light, damp charcoal grey planks stretch across the pier between stark white pillars of carved travertine.  Copper cleats are attached at regular intervals, their polished surfaces reflecting the aquamarine waters below.  Ropes coil near the base of the pillars, their fibers rough and weathered from the salty sea air."
