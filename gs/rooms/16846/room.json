      "Looking more like a forgotten nook in the tunnel than an office constructed for transacting government business, the clerk's cramped quarters is merely a fifteen-foot-square room with unpainted granite walls, floor and ceiling.  Exposed timbers shore up the ceiling timbers that bend precariously in the middle.  A warped desk with an unpadded metal chair behind it rests near a steel door.  Cabinets overflow with documents, and a post board near a steel door holds notices long outdated."
