    "description": [
      "Neatly organized dishes rest upon steel-reinforced shelves, which stretch the length of the narrow, galley-style kitchen.  Copper lanterns provide ample illumination throughout the windowless space and a clever pulley-system attached to the ceiling rotates several palm fronds in slow circles.  One segment of the counter has been turned into a polished wood chopping block that has a pile of fresh garlic cloves and a large stoneware basin on it, while opposite stands an iron stove supporting a steaming pot."
