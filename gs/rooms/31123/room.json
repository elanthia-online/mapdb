      "Several ornate brass candelabras illuminate this spacious room in which several tables have been arranged.  The tables are elegantly covered with white linen tablecloths, and on each is a small silver dragon candleholder. The candlelight is reflected by the polished white marble floor, and heavy red velvet curtains cover the glass windows."
