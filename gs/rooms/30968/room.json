      "Scattered herbs tiptoe into the courtyard from just beyond the wrought iron railing that guards the cliff's edge, their fragrance filling the sea-born air.  Starlight plays upon the metal of a small table surrounded by blue-cushioned chairs that is perfectly positioned to take in the panoramic ocean view."
