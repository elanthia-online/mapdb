    "description": [
      "Tiny motes of light flash aimlessly as fireflies gather about the landscape.  Two lofty trees stand on either side of the lawn as they guard over a freshwater pond between them.  An ancient ironwood prevails in the eastern half, while a stately haon tree spreads its boughs across the lawn's western side.  A stone path wanders through the yard, curving alongside a large fallen branch under the ironwood, before it reaches a low dock jutting over the pond."
