      "A tiny scratched image of two figures fighting with swords decorates one of the pilings, a crooked timber that looks ready to fall at any moment.  The piling is somehow more intact than most of the planks, which are cracked, broken, or rotted depending on their proximity to the crashing surf.  Icy waves throw up spray like cold needles as they crash mercilessly against the pier.  In the battle between water and wood, there can be only one victor.",
      "The thoroughfare of the main pier is wide and largely clear of debris.  Rotting barrels crowd to the sides of the dock, sprouting from heaps of netting, lines, and twine that have been similarly abandoned.  The cold has glazed all surfaces with a glistening coat of rime."
