    "description": [
      "Huge volcanic boulders interrupt the flat, sandy expanse of this vast area.  Training stations sit next to each boulder, and training in martial arts, weaponry and bodybuilding seems to be the main occupation of those gathered here.  Sandbags are piled haphazardly next to one nearby boulder.  Potted cacti next to standing, unlit torches and small stone figures of various creatures break up the monotony of the sandy flat.  A gate leads into a small walled compound."
