      "Trellises of latticed ebony provide the framework for a series of domed enclosures scattered across the pebbled garden, the stones creating a pale walkway through the lawn.  Lacquered lengths of rope suspend vivid faerthiel interspersed by sailor's knots, the tiny lanterns dancing like fireflies along with the ambient breezes off the nearby waters.  The faint echoes of music reverberate throughout the area, the instruments occasionally accompanied by a passing choir of impromptu performers."
