      "A closer examination of the temple's walls reveals nature's dual role of destroyer and consoler.  Vines have torn apart some of the more delicate carvings, but moss has healed the breaches in the stonework.  Friezes of stylized flames and lotus flowers that span the length of the facade are almost hidden in the shadows, but the sandstone figure of a kneeling woman on the lintel above the entrance is plainly visible even in the faint moonlight.",
