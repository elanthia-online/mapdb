      "Over the cliff side of the rise, red-gold light sweeps up into the underside of the trees, setting the leaves with their already vibrant fall colors aflame with illumination.  It makes the path ahead well lit and rather like strolling through a hall of stained glass windows lit by sunlight.  Off to one side of the path is a great heaping pile of fall leaves."
