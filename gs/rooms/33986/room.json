      "Sprigs of alyssum and amaranth are hand-painted across the parquetry dance floor, the sanguine and ivory-colored flora traced in splatters of gilded ink across the sweeping ballroom.  Pallid marble fountains spray water between the potted dark-colored foliage, the chilling mist clinging to the velvet-curtained windows, leaving the stained glass covered in rivulets of condensation.  Chiseled marble busts flank the various thresholds, each profile covered in a veil of aged, discolored lace."
