      "Crude friezes are painted along the walls of dark blue stone.  Under the feeble light of nautical lanterns hung from the ceiling by swaying chains, the paintings fluoresce an unsettling, vivid indigo, revealing the writhing bodies of countless eels.  Underfoot, the floor is transparent, offering glimpses of darting fish as they glint and gleam in the uncertain light.  Stairs of silver-shot marble descend into the depths below."
