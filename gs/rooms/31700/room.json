      "The split rail fence bordering the path extends straight to the river's edge, thus far hidden by the mists, then levels off to transition into the railing of a shallow but wide dock.  A pair of coils of heavy rope rest near the railing, while the far opposite end of the dock is occupied by a bunch of halved cider barrels.  Twin pendant lanterns dangle from mooring posts on opposite sides of the platform, with a small space to directly access the river left in the middle."
