      "Frosted globes dangle from the distant stone ceiling, providing a warm light that is reminiscent of sunlight.  Smooth walls filled with wrought iron grates stretch to the east, while the west terminates in a series of floor-to-ceiling shelves that are loaded with fresh linens, grey trousers, and white cotton shirts displaying an encircled kraken patch.  Flanking each other, a painted sign over the left-hand cell proclaims it as \"Gaol Five,\" while the right-hand cell is labeled \"Gaol Six.\""
