      "Skulls line alcoves along the walls of the temple's antechamber.  Some are darkened by age and riddled with jagged cracks, while others are clearly more recent acquisitions.  Haloed by candlelight, the alabaster statue of a small man with a wiry build stands at the chamber's center, his dancing shadow stretching almost to the entrance.  A bundle of foxglove lies heaped at his feet alongside offerings of coin and incense."
