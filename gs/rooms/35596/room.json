      "Beneath the engulfing shadow of the foremast, a heavy capstan of black iron rises from salted planks.  Thick spokes, scabbed with rust from exposure to the sea air, extend well past an arm's length from its center.  The mast's shrouds are anchored to the deck nearby with heavy chainplates of the same material, but a few are rusted through, leaving their rigging to flap aimlessly in the breeze.  With each of the sea's swells, the ship's ancient lines protest and the mechanism groans mournfully."
