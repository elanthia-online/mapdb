      "Several narrow, angled openings are cut in straight lines into the rock high overhead, each trickling water down the walls.  Every few moments, bursts of hot steam rush through each opening, creating a simple tune in a deep thrumming bass amidst the surroundings.  The floor is adorned with intricate tilework depicting various musical instruments, all rendered in a fanciful manner.  A small altar stands to the south, directly in front of a statue of an exuberant young man holding a harp."
