      "Winterberry hedges grow at the base of a wrought iron fence enclosing the yard of some forging workshops located beyond a blued steel gate.  The greenery helps to muffle some of the repetitive clanging of metal on metal emanating from within the workshops.  A narrow alley, marked with a clever sign crafted from the top of a hogshead barrel, jags off to the northeast.",
      "Boxwood hedge have been trained to grow here, wrapping around the poles of a wrought iron fence.  The grey stone of the outer wall of the city is just visible over the top of the fence, surrounding a cleared work yard.  The greenery helps to muffle some of the volume of the repetitive metal-on-metal noises emanating from the forging workshops located beyond the gate.  A narrow alley, marked with a clever sign crafted from the top of hogshead barrel, jags off to the northeast."
