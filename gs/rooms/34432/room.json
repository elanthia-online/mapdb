      "A long, polished mahogany table takes center stage in this well-lit meeting room.  Dark carpeting runs the length of the room, finely woven with messenger birds in flight and bordered by a twining grapevine motif in shades of taupe and mossy green.  Upon one wall, a large scale map of Elanith is framed above the tall carved credenza.  On the opposite wall, a marked-up calendar hangs beside several draft sheets of parchment.  Beside the door, a simple rectangular window looks out over the newsroom."
