      "Banners of stygian velvet trimmed with golden brocade are emblazoned with prowling jackals.  They twist in a cold breeze with no apparent source that gusts through the hallway in frigid surges.  Standing solitary atop a low circular platform at the chamber's center is a pair of doors hewn from black stone that reflects no light.  Shards of amber dreamstone gleam from the frame as if lit from within."
