      "Shale walls ripple outward in jagged terraces, their surfaces slick with moisture and flecked with veins of silver and rust.  Broad swaths of turtle grass blanket the cavern floor, their blades shifting in lazy undulations with the water's movement.  Thin streams of light spill from high openings above, casting shimmering ribbons across the shale and glinting from a polished nacre mirror hung against a rough outcrop.  Nearby, a barnacle-encrusted shell-shaped sign leans into the stone, its script softened by age."
