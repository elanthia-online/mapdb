      "Bundles of fragrant phlox, winter savory, and tufted goosegrass hang from the exposed rafters of the cottage, the scent of dried flora mingling with the haze from a cobblestone chimney.  Baskets, gardening and hunting tools, and various trinkets hang from the rough pine walls, creating a cluttered yet cozy feel to the space.  Low chairs surround the fireplace and rest upon a faded rug of ebon and tangerine hues."
