      "Shrouded in what seems a perpetual mist, this reinforced old dock creaks as the waves splash against its pilings.  Out in the bay, fishing boats trawl the waters dragging their nets.  A sleek brigantine flying a sapphire crested black flag sits at the end of the dock, a long wooden gangplank leading to it from the back of a varnished teak boathouse.",
      "Shrouded in what seems a perpetual mist, this rickety old dock creaks as the waves splash against its pilings.  Out in the bay, fishing boats trawl the waters dragging their nets.  Just far enough from the dock so that swimming would be difficult, a dilapidated sailless brigantine flying a tattered grey flag sits off of the harbor, its creaks and groans sounding like the last gasps of a dying man.",
