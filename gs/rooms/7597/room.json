      "A foul scent of rotting flesh fills the air in this alcove.  Close examination shows that the bed of moss and lichen against the wall has been filled with bones and bodies of various creatures, some almost human or at least gnomelike.  The corpses stuck between the rocks appear to be gnawed and stripped of flesh, as if they were being stored for food."
