      "All four walls are open to the surrounding area, and yet protected from the elements by the domed ceiling supported by carved columns that rise from a matching white marble railing.  A large brass-fitted telescope against one railing peers up into the heavens.  In the center of the room, a black cast iron brazier rests beside a basket of sticks.  Situated in a circle around the fireplace are several sofas, settees, and armchairs.  A low polished oak table sits between two chairs, its surface laden with refreshments.  A narrow stone staircase leads down."
