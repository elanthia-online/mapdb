      "Set back and away from the hustle and bustle of the town's center, this fence-edged area is a grassy sanctuary away from the dirt and mud of the streets.  A tall beribboned maypole is silvered by moonlight, as many of the ribbons encircling it are made of bright satins.  Just slightly behind the maypole sit the judges, who yawn behind raised hands as they wait for the next person brave enough to venture the climb.  On the opposite side of the pole is a scoreboard.",
