      "Hung with ebon-hued curtains, all but one side of the room is swathed in velvet.  The unadorned wall is cut with a small opening leading to a private alcove.  Carved from a large block of grey stone is a basin filled with crystal-clear water.  The surface shimmers as light from hovering crystal globes above gleams over the liquid."
