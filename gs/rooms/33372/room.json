      "Haon-framed chairs of burnt plum velvet are arranged before the silver-washed railing, their brush-shaped legs resting against the marbled ivory floor.  Heavy curtains are draped across the ceiling-high windows, obscuring the light through layers of lilac-on-aubergine brocade, the fabric pooling below a lacquered heartwood table affixed in the far corner.  A spherical silver lantern emanates a soft glow across the table's surface, providing a faint modicum of light."
