      "The Lassaran D'ahranal encampment is a sprawling maze of tents and lean-to shelters.  Here and there, livestock are tethered to long lines, and the field looks on its way to being grazed down of its tallest grasses.  In the middle of the bivouac, a table is covered with a veritable dead forest of maps, notes, and pinned missives."
