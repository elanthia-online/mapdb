      "The lane ends in a small cul-de-sac which looks down over the river below.  A neatly painted wooden fence separates the lane from the bustle of the town streets to the west.  Brightly blooming rosebushes surround the cul-de-sac, their fragrance blending with the fresh air of the waterfront."
