      "Tall birches and poplars compete with spreading maples, walnuts and elms for sunlight, water and nourishment.  In some places the birches and poplars seem to be winning, their long trunks extending narrowly up and their leaves clustered at the top to drink in the sunlight during the day.  In other places, though, it is apparent that the slower growing walnuts and elms eventually win out, as witnessed by the large number of rotting birch trunks beneath the wider trees' stately crowns.",
