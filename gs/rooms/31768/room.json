      "Rising like a sentinel over the high grasses beyond the curving track, the skeletal remains of a once towering tree hunkers to the north.  Though leafless and decrepit, the arboreal colossus still spreads a shadow upon the land, expanding and contracting like long fingers of inky blackness grabbing at the round wooden entrances to homes built directly into the barrow.  A series of smooth-featured stones carved in various forms of supplication encircle the tree."
