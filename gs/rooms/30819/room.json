      "Small inlets of crystal blue water run inland along carved troughs, vanishing into the tropical foliage, and pieces of driftwood pepper the white sands closest to the shore.  A lush green coconut palm arches over the beach until it is almost touching the water, anchored solidly by its thick, shaggy trunk.",

A lush green coconut tree arches over the beach until it is almost touching the water, its thick trunk the only thing holding it back."
