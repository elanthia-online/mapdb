      "Set back from the road at the end of a lane shaded by red larches is an ostentatious guild hall flying black and gold banners.  Carriages and wagons are chained to stakes in the spacious yard, most overseen by armored guards and mercenaries.  A plate of solid brass is riveted to the lintel over the arched entrance and depicts a set of scales heavy-laden with coin."
