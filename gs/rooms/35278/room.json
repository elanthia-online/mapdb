      "Stretching out into the clear aquamarine water, the pier's charcoal grey wooden planks are bordered by white travertine pillars.  Large baskets brimming with freshly caught fish are set near the end of the dock, their woven sides wet with seawater.  The distant greenery atop the sheer cliff is barely visible against the skyline."
