      "Behind a seashell-painted silk screen, woven rugs are scattered over a gleaming hardwood floor leading to a polished modwir counter.  An oval, sandstone-framed mirror hangs above a cushioned bench and small table topped with a painted terracotta planter.  Neatly stacked locker boxes take up one wall opposite an oil painting depicting a seaside town."
