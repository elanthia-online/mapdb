      "Sturdy mangroves stand along the shore like stooped sentinels, their tangled roots digging into the sands like gnarled fingers.  Their leaves glow green in the sunlight, canopies shading little crabs the color of verdigris that scuttle hurriedly among the root systems.  Waves break softly along the shore, the impassive trees taking the brunt of their fury."
