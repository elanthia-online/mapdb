      "Near to the entrance to Hope Alley, three small cottages sit at a bend in the way.  Two occupy the south side of the lane, residing behind a wall carved with roses and stylized hearts.  The third, it appears, is being slowly overrun by the glacier.  An outcropping of solid ice jabs out over the rooftop, jutting from the glacier proper.  The owners seem little deterred by the intrusion, having dug a small upper story into the ice.",
