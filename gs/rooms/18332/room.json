      "Eroded by the lagoon, damp soil tumbles into the water with the effortlessly lapping current, and small plants flourish from the constant source of hydration at the shoreline.  Moonlight dances over the thick, verdant carpet of moss and grass extending from the shore to the backdrop of towering trees and thick vegetation, helping to alleviate the heavy shadows of night encasing them."
