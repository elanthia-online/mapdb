      "The dark oak-paneled walls glow faintly blue, the luminescence cast from fungi-filled earthenware pots stationed around the room.  Bushel-sized wooden baskets clutter a long counter to one side, while bundles of herbs dangle from the low ceiling on strings.  The air is rich with the scent of wet dirt and mushrooms."
