      "Copper gears have been inset into the polished cherrywood walls of this spacious wagon, each reflecting light from candlelit globes to create a warm and welcoming environment.  A brass-edged cherrywood counter rests below a copper shelf, with a copper-framed sign set off to one side.  Silk-draped cherrywood partitioning separates the wagon's interior into two sections, a copper-threaded curtain leading into the back area."
