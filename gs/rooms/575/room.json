      "At the shore of a swift river, the path emerges from its cocoon of trees.  Serenaded by the rush of the water, the ambiance is serene, a welcome relief from the oppressive shadows within the forest's enclosure.  The trail continues for a short way to the southwest, following the stream's edge and zigzagging between large boulders.",
