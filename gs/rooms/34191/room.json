      "Moisture drips from cracks running the length of the rock wall, darkening the speckled granite in uneven streaks.  The susurrus of water rushing over stone is faint, but present.  To the east, thready veins of mottled green aventurine become wider and acquire glossy polish as they approach a tunnel intersection within the winding warrens."
