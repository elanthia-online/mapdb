    "description": [
      "Large white sandstone rocks litter the area, serving as places for the denizens of this pen to lounge and soak up the sunlight streaming in through the glass roof above.  Along the perimeter, white jasmine has been strung around the fence, suffusing the area with a pleasant scent.  At the center, a small fire pit has been dug to provide further warmth for the animals present.  You also see a white wooden gate leading out of the pen."
