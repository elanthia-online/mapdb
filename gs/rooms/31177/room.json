      "Towering boulders meet the edge of a pine forest to the east and block the cliff to the north, their faces smooth from exposure to the elements and pock-marked with rust-hued lichen.  Huckleberry bushes huddle against the edge of a small pond, their bright green, rounded leaves mottled with reddish hues.  A pair of stepping stones leads from the water's edge into the pond where a floating mat of collected moss resides."
