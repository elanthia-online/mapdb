      "The light here is almost blinding, due to the salt crystals embedded in the walls and the stalactites about you reflecting the glow of the mushrooms in the tunnel.  You can taste the salt in the air every time you take a breath, making your lungs itch and burn.  The light seems a tad dimmer to the northeast and the ground gets rather soggy to the east."
