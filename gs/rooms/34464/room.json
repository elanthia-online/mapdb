      "The lattice-woven walls of oak and laurel are washed in honey-colored paint, the amber and gilded tones complemented by enamel flowers interspersed between the crossed beams of wood.  A trio of beehive-shaped lanterns are nestled at the far corner of the stacked stone counter, the display firmly positioned in the center of the shop.  Short wood-planked racks are scattered along the periphery, filled from top to bottom with bolts of undyed fabric."
