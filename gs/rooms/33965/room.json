      "Walls of pale grey stone enclose the spacious building, while thick rafters of oak support the layers of a compact thatched roof.  Partially covering the polished wooden floor is an oval braided rug mixed with a wide range of green.  Centered in the room is a live-edge maple table draped with a forest green velvet runner.  Next to a curtain-draped archway is a series of bronze hooks fashioned in the shape of various skeletal creatures."
