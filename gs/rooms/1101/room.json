      "The trail turns, following the plateau's curve.  A small mountain range, barely more than scrub hills, unfolds below the plateau to the south.  The wind continues to sing its melancholy song, rising and falling as it dips in and out of the crevices on its way across the Dead Plateau.  The cloudless night sky adds to the chill as the day's heat stored in the grey basalt escapes quickly into the cold night air.",

The sun, beaming down from the cloudless sky, brings no warmth, only an uncomfortable brightness as it reflects off the grey basalt surface."
