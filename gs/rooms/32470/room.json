      "Near the mouth of the gallery, a portrait in a brilliantly gilded frame looks down at the walkway with a bemused smile on her face.  The painting depicts a surpassingly beautiful woman framed against a quay tossed by storms.  Drapes have been drawn over the broad picture windows along the hallway, and the light of the torches on the opposite wall makes the eyes of the figure seem to dance with secret amusement."
