      "Before you stands an old, but relatively intact, building.  The crumbly walls appear to have once been painted white, but have since yellowed with weather and age.  A small door set into the wall hangs on by its rusted hinges, a sharp, distinct odor drifting out from within.  Moss covered walkways lead off in several directions, but the passing mist obscures whatever might lay down them."
