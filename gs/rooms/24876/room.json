      "The path ends on a small platform, where hanging just out of reach over the crater are some massive chains, swaying back and forth.  The ceiling of the cavern is carved out in a circular shape surrounding the chains as they continue skyward.  Dense banks of clouds cling to the opening in the ceiling, blotting out any light from above."
