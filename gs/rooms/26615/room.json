      "A ring of dying torches flickers through the grotto, the flames casting elongated shadows over the pale greenish waters.  A crumbling curved stairway cuts alongside the underground pool, the ramp briefly concealed as the torches threaten to be extinguished by the rivulets of liquid dripping from the ceiling."
