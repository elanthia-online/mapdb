      "Several circular targets hang from the fire-tinged remnants of a trio of oak trees, their bloodied ropes swinging the pieces in pendulum-like motions.  Set just along the higher branches are a pair of hemp nooses, the skeletal targets filled with arrows stuck within their ribcages and skulls.  Some muddy leather boots stand a few feet away from the trees, the owner's tibia bones still firmly set within them."
