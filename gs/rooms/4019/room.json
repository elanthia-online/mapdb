      "Stacks of furs and pelts are thickly layered upon maoral shelves which cover the shop's stone walls from floor to ceiling.  Several glaesine lanterns hanging from the rafters above cast a dim amber glow across the windowless room.  A lone counter sits at the rear of the shop, behind which the shop's proprietor stands, waiting for patrons to assist."
