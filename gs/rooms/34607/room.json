    "description": [
      "High overhead, a vast, spread-winged owl of bronze perches atop the apex of an arched steel gate separating the town from the wilds beyond.  Cool and imperious, its metallic eyes watch the roadway below as it winds between booksellers' shops and pipe dens.  The latter breathes the scent of their sweetly earthy smokes out onto the roadway, where the odor mingles with the woodsy fragrance of incense drifting from the temples to the northwest."
