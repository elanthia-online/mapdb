      "Creamy white parchment screens separate this space from the main pavilion.  Trunks and boxes laden with wares are piled high in the corners, waiting to be sorted and set out for sale.  Wedged between woven reed bins, a dye-splattered bin, filled with vivid, liquid-filled vials, creates a colorful centerpiece."
