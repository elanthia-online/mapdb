      "Suits of matching plate armor stand sentry along opposing walls, each no taller than an elven child.  Centered along the back wall is a suit of burnished crimson field plate.  An elegant banner covers the wall behind the lone armor.  A long wooden shelf and a glass-paneled case flank the open walnut door.  Stretched across the polished walnut floor is a gold-edged deep crimson rug."
