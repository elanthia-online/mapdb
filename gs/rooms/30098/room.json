      "The interior of this tent has been painted with a starry night motif with scattered pale specks forming familiar constellations amidst a backdrop of deep blues and blacks. Several metallic contraptions have been set atop small stone pillars, their gears and joints clearly well-maintained, but their purpose unknown. The tantalizing aroma of fudge wafts in from somewhere."
