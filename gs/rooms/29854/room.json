      "Every surface of this chamber is cast in white and glass.  Against pale walls, bleached wooden bookcases and cabinets hold shelf after shelf of tidy white pages and manuscripts on glittering glass-crafted shelves.  A painted white staircase connects the chamber to the floor above, while a hint of purple indicates the way to the stairs leading back down."
