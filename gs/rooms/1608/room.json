      "Small board-and-plank shops wearing the odious whitewash of perching gulls line either side of the bridge.  Relying on the bridge's traffic for business, and taking advantage of the gentle incline from here to the peak of the bridge, the shops look to be an odd mix that might appeal to Marshtowner and 'Havener alike.  You notice a small, weathered cask hangs above the doorway of one of the shops."
