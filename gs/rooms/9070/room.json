      "The strange lack of snow goes right up to the western edge of Dervish Park, and several homefronts take advantage of it with their walkways directed towards the field.  Several planters line the edge of a small serene pond.  A few halflings sit on the bank fishing and basking in the warmth before returning to the cold outside the mithril gate.  Others stroll happily along carefully manicured pathways, enjoying the flora and fauna that thrive in this temperate haven."
