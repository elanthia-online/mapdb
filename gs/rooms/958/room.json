      "Stray twigs and torn bits of dried grass cling to the rocks in this area, their tiny frames blown about by frequent chill blasts from the mountain winds.  A barely audible scuttling can be heard as the gusts subside, perhaps from the subtle movements of small animals hidden within the blanket of night.",
