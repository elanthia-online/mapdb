      "The uneven floor dips sharply at the northern end of the tunnel, where rivulets of dripping water have collected in a deep, clear pool.  The tunnel has long ago collapsed into a caved-in barrier of stone that half-fills the pool and blocks any further passage.  The tips of several stalagmites break the mirrored surface of the water like the spines of some enormous sea creature."
