    "description": [
      "The starboard upper deck is riddled with gaps, its timbers rotting away beneath heaps of seaweed and clusters of opportunistic barnacles.  The main mast has fallen, crashing through a weak spot of railing to point accusatorily out into the waters to the north.  Partially submerged in the brine, portholes along the upper hull gape like blind eyes into submerged darkness.  Remnants of the ship's name are limned in golden paint, barely legible but clinging defiantly to the mutilated hull."
