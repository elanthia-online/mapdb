      "A breeze circles in through the window, carrying with it a hint of fresh air and the suggestion of recent rainfall.  A cobblestone floor, adorned with mats and pillows for both decoration and use, shows little signs of wear and tear.  A glowing globe sits on a shelf near the window, directly beneath an extravagant tapestry.  The whistle of the wind enters through an arched doorway that stands open to the elements outside."
