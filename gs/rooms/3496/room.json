      "A small covered porch wraps around the front of a large shop.  Climbing roses creep up the structure's stone walls, sending cascades of deep red blossoms out into the var.  An elaborate sign hangs from two small hooks on the eaves of the porch.",
      "A small covered porch fronts the general store.  An elaborate sign hangs from two small hooks on the porch's roof.  Rope wraps the porch posts closest to the door.  Cool night air blows through the var, making the sign rock slightly on its hooks.",

      "The shop still stands, but barely.  It lists severely to one side, its stone walls knocked decidedly out of plumb.  The shingled roof that formerly covered the porch has collapsed in the middle, its fractured edges charred.",
      "Standing stoutly at the edge of the var, a single-story limestone building houses the Ta'Vaalor General Exchange.  A trio of thick, square windows on either side serve to bracket the sturdy wooden door, which is reinforced with narrow strips of vivid crimson eahnor.  Mounted directly above the wooden door is a sign."
