      "A great mound of rubbish and filth rises up here west of the commons.  Trash from every inn and tavern in Elanthia must have been dragged here to make it.  High above the surrounding slovenly huts rests an even more slovenly sight: a decrepit fishing boat lies keel-up amid the filth.  Gaping holes dot the rotting hull, only a few stopped with rickety shields and other scraps of wood serving as doorways and shutters.  The fishermen are gone, but the smell of fish lingers on."
