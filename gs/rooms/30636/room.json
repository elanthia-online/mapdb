      "A refreshing breeze blows across the granite-railed balcony, offering a quick respite from the ballroom.  The high vantage point offers a clear view of the eastern part of Wehnimer's Landing, and hundreds of people wander the streets below, appearing as ants as they go about their business.  Two potted plants frame the glass doors leading back inside, and gold-stitched red banners are draped from the roof of the building."
