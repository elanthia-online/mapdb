      "Beyond the ashwood door leading into the wagon lies a cluttered entryway, bracketed on either side with pockmarked shelving crowded with knickknacks, dried mushrooms, a collection of candy jars, and other miscellanea.  Perched precariously on one sagging shelf, a neatly printed placard rests catawampus near an assortment of boxes.  A shabby magenta rug with carefully mended patches covers most of the floor."
