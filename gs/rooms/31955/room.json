      "Leafy, overhanging boughs cast shadows upon the countless brambles arching over one another to form perilously thorned domes.  Almost hidden by the natural camouflage, a stygian opening creates a break in the tangles of sharp-toothed briars.  A precarious, cobbled path dives southerly toward a stacked stone archway, the unattached portal framing a golden scene that brightens in comparison to the oppressive darkness enclosing the world before it."
