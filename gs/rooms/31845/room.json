      "Shapes emerge from the unraveling mists as a dim light begins to creep through the overhanging trees, their branches weighted with thick, heavy moss.  In the distance, a crumbling mausoleum comes into view behind a tall, wrought iron fence.  A rocky path leads away from a wooden dock at the water's edge."
