      "This compartment is fairly spacious and well-appointed, with an aubergine velvet sofa sitting adjacent to a glass-topped ebonwood sideboard which is lined with open-faced shelves occupied by fine decanters and glasses.  The floor is covered wall-to-wall with thick plum-hued carpeting, and lanterns with cut glass shades are mounted periodically along the walls."
