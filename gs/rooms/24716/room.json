    "description": [
      "A compact half-sphere of thick trees circles outward to eventually peel away and reveal the broken and scattered remnants of what appears to have once been a village.  Some wooden buildings remain intact with little overgrowth, while others have been left in useless piles of rubble, smashed or scorched.   Intermittent flecks of silver or golden light can be seen within the hazy mist that saturates the edge of the woods."
