      "This room encompasses the entire third story of the building, with bull's-eye windows perfectly aligned along the length and two large picture windows on either end looking down upon the second-story balconies.  One side comprises the sleeping area, with a carved narra bed and a koa wardrobe, and the other a sitting room of sorts with a nacre-inlaid teak desk and several chairs around a riverstone fireplace.  Scattered across the polished koa and teak floor are several lamps and a few handwoven carpets, with a silver and brass hatch by one wall."
