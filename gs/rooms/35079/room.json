      "Driftwood shelves jut from the raw timber walls, stained by saltwater but sturdy enough to support the weight of the packing materials lining them.  Only a single torch lights the niche, leaving its smoky eaves partly lost in shadow.  A small display of envelopes and stampbooks sits atop the counter, accompanied by several cylinders of wax in different colors."
