      "A pile of weathered and faded pillows provides a measure of comfort near a wide wooden railing that looks out over Darkstone Bay.  The salty spray of the waters periodically splashes up to add to the stains along a copper-banded keg, while a narrow wooden gangplank juts out over the side of the deck, warped under the weight of time and use."
