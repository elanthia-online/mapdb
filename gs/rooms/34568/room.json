      "In stark contrast to the rest of the wagon, this workshop is immaculately organized, albeit chockablock with tools, reference books, and jeweler's supplies.  Each gadget and gizmo gleams neatly from the hook, table, or shelf that houses it.  A glass-paneled lantern hung above a plushly cushioned bench provides ample lighting for even the most painstaking handiwork."
