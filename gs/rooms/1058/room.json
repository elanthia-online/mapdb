      "A large pile of white bones stands between the trail and the forest.  The bones are devoid of any flesh, and most appear to be from animals such as boar, urgh and rolton.  The forest is impenetrable, but through the screen of vegetation numerous lights of varying colors flash, spin, and appear to advance and recede accompanied by raucous laughter and loud singing in an undecipherable tongue.  The trail continues to run between the forest and the moor."
