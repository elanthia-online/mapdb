      "A deep crevice bisects the walkway near an intersection of three tunnels.  Though no wider than a handspan at its broadest point, the crack plummets down into shadow, its walls shot through with veins of pale grey mithril ore.  From somewhere deep below, the sound of rushing water echoes, but the distance has muted its mighty roar to a meek whisper easily lost in the sound of pattering water that fills the darkness."
