      "Carefully tended beds of glowing moss in blue, green, silver, and even spots of red radiate outward from the nexus, between the numerous walkways of the courtyard.  A smattering of unnatural metal trees enclose the area along with their equally fabricated foliage in a riot of colors.  Sitting on a hewn stalagmite base is a small keg and a sign."
