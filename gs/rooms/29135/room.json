      "The steep rise brings with it brisk winds, drowning out the sounds of barking dogs and late-night revelers from the town below.  Tenacious beach grasses cling to the rocky embankment rising steeply to the northeast, while a gentler slope trails through the pebbled sands due west.  A moisture-laden mist carried on the breeze is saturated with the scent of the sea.",
