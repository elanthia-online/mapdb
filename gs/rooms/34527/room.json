      "A portrait of Darkstone Castle hangs on one of the knotty pine walls, and a modwir beam ceiling rises overhead.  A pile of striped throw pillows sits in one corner of a polished oak floor.  There is a flexible willow woven basket on one side of the shop and a vine-carved mahogany table on the other."
