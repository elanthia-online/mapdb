      "Towering walls of fitted stone line this spacious hall, arcing inward near the top to form the vaulted ceiling above.  Shredded tapestries and faded wall-hangings of purple and gold hang in tattered streamers from the walls among long ribbons of dust-laden spider's webs.  Tables and chairs, splintered and unserviceable, are piled in a large heap near the arch, while a sideboard, still draped in old festival streams, leans precariously near a small passageway cut into the rear wall."
