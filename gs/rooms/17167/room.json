      "Deep grey walls sparkle with glittering stars, reflecting the soft white light of glowing orbs situated in each corner.  Pristine white silky sheets cover a large sleighbed that is nearly overshadowed by a magnificent crystal sculpture.  An oil painting rests above the bed, depicting a peaceful evening illuminated by shooting stars."
