      "Occupying a large section of the hallway, a cherrywood curio with glass doors displays various pieces of collected bric-a-brac and keeps them safe from prying fingers.  Standing opposite one another, a painted blue door leads to the guest room, while the double-wide doors lead to the master bedroom.  An ocean-themed, circular rug dominates the landing, its glossy mahogany planks easily transitioning into a wall-hugging maoral staircase that leads to the floor below."
