      "Framed by walls lined with shelves bearing a plenitude of spices and sundries, the welcoming pantry is gently lit by frosted glass windows.  At the center, a spacious granite island boasts a spread of delectables and beverages spaced around an ice sculpture carved to resemble a thriving wolf pack.  Just inside the spruce archway, a shallow porcelain wash basin rimmed in hand-painted winterberries stands at the ready."
