      "The forest passes near the edge of the plateau giving a breathtaking view of Mreanith Lake spreading out below to the east.  Unfortunately, the pristine view of the lake and surrounding valley is marred by the presence of a rather foul odor.  Wagon tracks lead directly to the edge of the precipice, and pieces of refuse are scattered on the ground near the dropoff.  It is evident where much of the garbage produced in Zhindel's Hold gets deposited."
