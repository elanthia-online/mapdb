      "Several wooden tables stand along the southern wall.  Before each table are several chairs, with a mirror hanging above the table before each seat.  Luminescent orbs glow brightly around each mirror.  One corner of the room is crowded with a desk topped by all manner of gaudy jewelry, painted masks, and colorful wigs."
