      "Situated along the wall, a polished ebonwood table is nestled between a pair of blood red leather benches, the padded seats a little worse for wear.  The cozy booth is separated from the one in front and behind by brass-set stained glass panels of eerie forest scenes.  A large bowl of popped corn partially conceals a lightning bolt-shaped scorch mark on the table."
