      "Tiny shrubs bearing small pinkish flowers and white berries encircle the perimeter of a dilapidated two-story building.  As if painted by the hand of a child, the image of a lopsided mug topped with foam decorates the door.  Attached to a braided rope, a rusty bucket rests on the lip of a well.  Slumped against its side is a tattered doll.  The branches of a dead tree droop over the thatch roof, blackened pieces of its bark littering the ground."
