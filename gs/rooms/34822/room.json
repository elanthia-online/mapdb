      "Surrounded in the serrated, black-purple leaves of towering beech hedges, the small garden is quiet and serene.  Flowerbeds of echinacea and zinnia rest at the edges of angular flagstones that are overgrown with leafy pimpernel.  A decorative marble fountain with a wide ledge sits at the heart of the space, its waters cascading over a copper mandrake statue."
