      "Slowly rotating one way then the other, a large crystal prism hangs over the center of the floorspace in the back of this large tent.  Multihued motes dance across the walls and wares here, refracting light from the entryway to the west, and are a constant source of entertainment for passing patrons who partake in the visual display."
