      "Curving along the edge of the grotto, the path reveals a stunning inlet carved from the shoreline, its shape resembling a perfect slice of pie.  Blue waters shimmer over white sands flecked with mica, each grain catching the ambient light with a soft sparkle.  Across the inlet, the cliffs of the Agora Promenade rise dramatically, their rugged faces touched by shifting hues.  Nearby, travertine statues stand in elegant relief, their intricate forms more visible against the calm waves."
