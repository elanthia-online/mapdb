      "Sky blue washed walls surround the plush green carpeting of this nature-inspired room.  The ceiling is decorated with white fluffy clouds.  An oak tree-shaped bookcase stands in the far corner of the room, its branches covered sparsely with green felt leaves and hanging multicolored lanterns.  Along the opposite wall rests a lacquered oak bench topped with coppery velvet cushions.  Sprawled in the middle of the room lies a peach and white checkered blanket covered with fuzzy squirrel-shaped pillows."
