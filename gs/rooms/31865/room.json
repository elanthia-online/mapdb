      "Dark briar hedges loom behind a riverstone lodge, dozens of tiny, candelit gourds impaled on their thorns casting eerie shadows across the grounds.  In front of the lodge, a frozen lake sparkles in the starlight, and large drifts of snow block access to everything except the lodge entrances and the pathway.",
