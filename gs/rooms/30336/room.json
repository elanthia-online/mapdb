      "Sprawling across the icy oak decking, a gold and crimson-striped tent occupies the bow and utilizes two wrought iron hooks in place of stakes, the metal covered in a frosty sheen.  The consistent sound of hammering filters from between the canvas sheets, muffled by the snow.  Just beyond the peak of the tent, a stony arm rises into the air and is holding aloft a copper lantern."
