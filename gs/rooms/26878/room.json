      "With barely enough room to move around, this cramped space between the two buildings seems more like a trap than anything else.  A small pile of crumbled cement has gathered on the floor beneath a brick that protrudes slightly from the wall.  Trails of fresh rat droppings lead between a sigil-incised display case and a rune-covered wooden crate."
