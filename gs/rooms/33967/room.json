      "A simple cot outfitted with a grey cotton bedroll and a plump goose feather pillow is pushed up against the wall beneath a circular window, the diffused light filtering through the colored glass slicing the room in two.  Across from a roseate tufted armchair with a matching footstool, a walnut worktable displays a porcelain mask project in process amid a scattering of jewels and feathers.  Velvet-cushioned boxes packed with elaborate disguises are stacked on narrow shelves covering the walls."
