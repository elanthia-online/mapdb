      "Hovering below the ceiling, a miasma of smoke drifts through the small hut from a nearby window, choking the air and forming a haze that obscures the walls.  Faint light trickles in through an opening in the peaked, twig-covered roof, creating pools of light upon shelves that ring the space.  A low sleeping pallet filled with preserved furs is thrown against one wall, while several ancient food crocks are scattered about the dirt floor."
