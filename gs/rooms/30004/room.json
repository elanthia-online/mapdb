      "Arched beams of yew struggle against the weight of the longhouse's collapsing roof.  A black stone statue, once heroic in scope and stature, has been thrown down from its place atop a raised dais at the rear of the longhouse, and it lies in shattered chunks across the wood panel floor.  Smears of dried blood adorn the walls, forming serpentine patterns, but there is no sense to the gibberish scrawlings."
