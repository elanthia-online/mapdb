    "description": [
      "Neat and tidy, the stall is partially walled off from the main forge by varied blacksmiths' tools that hang on ropes along the rear.  A much smaller hearth is situated next to the tools, a set of bellows, a slack tub, and two protrusion-ridden anvils gathered around it.  Horseshoes, nails, and horse armor make up the majority of the finished pieces that are visible in the stall, with a very select type of armor and gauntlets seemingly the only non-equine subject of interest to the proprietor, a petite copper-haired blacksmith."
