      "Near the aft portion of the ship's grey-green deck, the railing has given way to permit a dangerous but thorough view of the ship's starboard hull.  Despite the great age of the vessel and its considerable disrepair, there are the bones of a sleek and predatory ship beneath the decay.  The timbers around her portholes are painted in silver gilt and emerald lacquer to form radiating streamers of kelp."
