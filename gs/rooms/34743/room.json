    "description": [
      "Pristine red and white roses sweeten the small alcove with their velvety perfume, notes of honey and spice lingering on the air.  Pedestals draped in white velvet hold a variety of relics.  One supports a coiled whip, another a blackened humerus fused with shards of blue-black razern, and a third a crystal bottle full of ruddy sand.  Each has a placard beneath it.  The eastern wall boasts a teardrop-shaped mirror of silver, the decoration's simplicity in peculiar counterpoint to the chamber's elegant decor."
