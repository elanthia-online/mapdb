      "Large chunks of rock lay strewn about the tunnel, making the way precarious.  A lone torch, sputtering in its iron sconce, provides just enough light to traverse the rubble.  A cracked bone the size of a whole gnome sticks out of the exposed earthen wall that appears to have served as an archway to the passageway."
