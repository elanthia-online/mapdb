      "A marvel of dwarven masonry, this ancient spiral staircase carved into the rock of the mountain is wide enough to accommodate simultaneous up and down traffic.  While they may have once been sharp-cornered, the steps have been rounded over time by the countless passersby that have traversed them.  An iron chain secured to the wall serves as a right-handed railing opposite the central column that is worn smooth from the contact of many hands seeking its support."
