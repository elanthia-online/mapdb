      "The walls of the corridor are unadorned except for a pair of brass wall sconces, used to illuminate the area.  On either side of the corridor, a maoral door and an oak door stand ajar and at the end of the hall is a highly polished linden door.  An arch to the southwest opens into the rotunda and silver-veined marble covers the floor."
