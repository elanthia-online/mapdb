      "Narrow lengths of purple carpeting cover the dark chestnut marble flooring of the hallway.  On the north wall is a heavy rosewood door and on the opposite wall facing it is a silver-traced door.  The remainder of the hallway branches off into other rooms, likely the quarters for the staff on the riverboat."
