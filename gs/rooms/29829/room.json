      "Azure paints blend into the twilight hues of a dying day across the rafters of the ceiling, while star-shaped votive holders fashioned of stained glass dangle from above.  Pale grey dominates the walls, except for melon and amethyst-hued curtains that frame the windows.  Various weapon racks stand at even intervals about the space, their wares glimmering in the dim light."
