      "Thick skeins of dust-laden webs slant across the rough stone walls of the corridor, their pallid tendrils swaying as the air beneath them is disturbed.  Tattered and faded, an ochre and pale green banner presides over a glass and brass display case.  Debris, comprised of discarded rodent bones and moldy papers, litters the floor, which is covered with a hole-riddled carpet of faded silk."
