      "Contrasting with the surrounding areas, the walls here are lined in thick lead and iron plates.  Several plates on the walls are dented or severely scorched.  A collection of tables with various glassware, tools, and containers upon them are scattered through the room.  A large sign on the far wall is severely dented in its center.  A series of racks on one side of the wall hold stretched skins in the process of tanning."
