      "A few brass buttons and a heavy mace distinguish the otherwise charred and unrecognizable remains of a guard near the door.  His torch, now cold, lies at his side.  Other bodies lie huddled together as if trying to shield one another from the disaster without success.  Their flesh has long since given way to bone, and yet the stench of burning flesh hangs in the air as if the conflagration had occurred only yesterday."
