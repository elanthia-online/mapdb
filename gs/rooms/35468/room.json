      "The simplicity of the space allocated to the High Council of the Sylvisterai in the Wild belies the authority gathered to those who take up station within.  The glade is little more than a circular bit of field, thick with grasses and blooms, within which is a ring of woven rush mats.  If the flowers bloom here a little bigger around the periphery of the circle, or the grass grows a little thicker here or greener, surely it's just a trick of the light."
