      "Nestled into this corner of the pavilion is a small sales nook lined with plush rugs.  A multicolored assortment of stained glass lanterns illuminate the shop's wares with a warm welcoming glow.  Decorative plants in glazed pots line the walls and hang from the ceiling, creating a verdant oasis in this nook."
