      "As you travel along this stretch of tunnel, the ceiling disappears and the walls fall away, replaced by elaborately carved, massive marble columns to either side.  At least ten dwarves around, their tops are lost in the darkness above.  Shadows obscure what lays beyond them to the east and west.  The air is cold and damp, and the darkness is oppressive in this vast and ancient place."
