      "White and red roses crawl the gilded fence of the garden, the pristine buds and blossoms filling the air with a gently sweet perfume.  No less lovely are the abundance of mournblooms and bleeding heart that prosper in beds lined with pale chunks of stone, jealously guarded by stinging nettle.  The flora bounds a trail of crushed alabaster running from gates of white imflass to a pale marble temple erected far from the street."
