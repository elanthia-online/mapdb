      "Blackened heather and charred rocks cover the bleak ground, and only a few deep green blades of living grass push through the scorched earth as a faint sign of life.  Thick grey mist swirls in the bone-chilling wind, its ghostly tendrils like ancient smoke from whatever long-ago fire blackened the land."
