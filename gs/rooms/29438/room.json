      "Dissimilar to the rest of the shop, this area has been kept in great shape.  Sturdy shelves line two of the walls from floor to ceiling in this quaint space, stuffed with tomes, maps, notes, and drawings.  Several desks bearing various tinctures of colorful inks, assortments of parts, and half-finished maps are clustered together in the center of the room.  A makeshift bed that is neatly made sits against a wall decorated in depictions of various creatures; a pair of slippers rest at its base."
