    "description": [
      "Covered in a mottled gravel of red marl, limestone, and shale, the open air shipyard is filled with light from lanterns and torches anchored to the surrounding fences.  The vast expanse is dotted with wooden scaffolds and large pulley systems, their ropes and beams gleaming in the starlight.  Despite the hour, the air hums with the sounds of saws and hammers as nighttime workers continue where the day crew has left off, the industrious sounds mingling in air along with the scent of sawdust and sea salt."
