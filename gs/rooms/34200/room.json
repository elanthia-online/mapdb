      "The passage winds around a tiered rock formation that forms a natural series of jutting limestone shelves.  Water bubbles up from the topmost tier, hissing and spitting a fine mist at erratic intervals, and sloshes over into the lower shelves.  Colorful mineral deposits trail in layered streaks down the stone, bracketing thin streams of noxious water that diffuse across the tunnel floor."
