      "A swinging door provides glimpses of the long tables and benches in the refectory each time it opens.  The walls of the kitchen are lined with counters, water tubs, and stone-lined ovens positioned to vent excess heat through the outer wall.  The floor is slightly slick from spilled food but the kitchen is otherwise clean."
