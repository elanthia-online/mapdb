      "The path ends at Greymist's feet, where a clearing marks the demarcation between forest and the younger saplings.  This portion of the tropical woodlands appears to be a finger of trees stretching south from the greater body of Greymist.  The belt of jungle stands along the edge of cliffs, which overlook the sea.  The distant sound of the surf provides a soft background of thunder, as waves buffet the rocky escarpments.  The trail narrows and winds into the jungle foliage."
