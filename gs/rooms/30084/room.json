      "Holly grows in iced-over patches along the edges of the game trail, lending bright splashes of crimson to the snowy surroundings.  Laying abandoned in one patch is a rough-carved hoarbeam staff adorned with raw bloodrubies, its owner's torn arm several paces away.  The fingers and knuckles have been gnawed on by creatures, but the hand is otherwise remarkably well preserved by the surrounding snow and ice."
