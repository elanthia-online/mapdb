      "A solitary phosphorescent anglerfish swims casually about you, assessing you with its toothy mouth agape.  Its bright, fleshy, illuminated lure is akin to a yellow eye with a penetrating gaze.  In the vast, cold and empty stillness, you grow aware of the *whoosh* of your own breathing and the steady pounding of your heart."
