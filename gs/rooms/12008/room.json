      "The walls of the tunnel are dry above the water even with the constant presence of a foot of water at the bottom.  The air, likewise, is dry, and the water is rather cold.  The greenish cast emanating from the liquid does nothing to warm the area but only serves to illuminate the walls and ceiling with a cold emerald light."
