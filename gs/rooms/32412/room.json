      "A toymaker's shop along the streetside is boarded up, doors and windows secured by sturdy lengths of hoarbeam and nails thicker than a finger.  The broad display window is cracked at the center, the damage radiating outward from the point of impact in a spiderweb pattern.  Though obstructive, the damage and boards do not entirely obscure the phalanx of painted, smiling toys standing attentively on the other side of the window, their lifeless eyes watching the street."
