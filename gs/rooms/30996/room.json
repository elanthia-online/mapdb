      "Painted in gradient hues from niveous to virescent, the walls of the tidy little shop resemble a rainbow if its hues slowly transitioned one handspan at a time.  Crisp white shelves are arranged beneath strategically placed orbs of light and hung at approximately midway between floor and ceiling around the room, while short display counters house gnomish devices just below them.  A stack of rolled parchments stick out of a hexagonal cubby near the exit."
