      "Smooth, pale stone walls encircle the spacious area, and evenly dispersed windows provide plenty of light.  A large portrait hangs next to a pale stone arch, and above the arch is an elegant sign.  Tucked into an alcove are some rough stone steps flanked by a gold-bound plaque and a highly polished gold sconce.  Rising through the center of the ceiling is a wrought-iron spiral staircase.  Accessible through an archway to the east is a rope and plank bridge."
