      "This room produces a deep feeling of true warmth and comfort in you, despite its unpretentious fittings.  A plain oak-framed bed sits along one wall and a simple maple table flanked by wicker chairs stands nearby.  A welcoming glow emanates from the fireplace.  Piled on the table are a number of scrolls tied with silk and secured with wax seals."
