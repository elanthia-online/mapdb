      "Sanguine mosses, sodden and squishy, cushion the alien landscape in a lurid display of color.  Shaped like gargantuan disks, chartreuse sundews tilt at diverse angles and decorate the terrain in a random, spotty pattern.  Dense roseate hairs sprout from the flat surfaces, tipped with viscous globules of mucilage.  The sticky orbs slowly consume hapless insects hopelessly trapped within."
