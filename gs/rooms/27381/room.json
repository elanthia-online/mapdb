      "The tent is large and airy, smelling strongly of good ale and honest sweat.  Giantmen chat with the barkeep, who seems perfectly happy to talk.  A large group clusters about a barrel in the corner.  As they drain their mugs they dip them into the keg, refilling them with good giantkin beer."
