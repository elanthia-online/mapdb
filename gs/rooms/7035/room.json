      "This room is in surprisingly good condition.  The walls are solid and unbroken and there are even some furnishings in good repair to be seen.  Perhaps a guardroom or entry hall, it now seems to do duty as both a bedchamber and library.  A rough but servicable bed sits in one corner and a massively solid blackened oak table sits in the center of the room with some ancient leather-bound books upon it.  A woven tapestry hangs on the far wall, heavy and black as primordial sin."
