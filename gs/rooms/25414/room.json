      "Arched windows with narrow slits along each wall of this stone room provides ample line of sight on the environs surrounding the outpost.  Racks of spears and javelins are positioned near windows, and hooks jut out from the walls with quivers of arrows hanging from them.  Through the view of a window, a crisp blue banner embroidered with a silver phoenix flaps in the wind."
