      "The flats slope downward to the south with gentle eddies of rock that grew from erupting underground furnaces.  A few pits cluster beside the trail to the west, full of steaming muck.  Every so often a trapped bubble of steam escapes the clutches of the mud, making a loud plopping sound as it bursts, and spraying the pit's perimeter with a shower of mud."
