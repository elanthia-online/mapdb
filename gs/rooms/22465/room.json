      "The combined smells of oil, steam, and molten metal assault the senses, and the distinct sound of a hammer on anvil resounds from beyond a wrought invar door located near the back wall of this dimly lit sales floor.  Racks filled with merchandise are attended to by a pair of young dwarven clerks dressed in blacksmith's garb.  Opposite the invar door, a forged glaes ramp leads out."
