      "Tendrils of silver-cast ivy frame the ebony-planked walls of the shop, the hammered metal leaves curtaining the thorn-framed stand occupying the west wall.  Tall burgundy glass lanterns are affixed on either side of a faenor rack bedecked in garlands of leafy florals, the lavender and roses scenting the air.  A collection of parchment-labeled bottles are displayed on elongated shelves leading north, the colorful containers filled with various liquors arranged between wide glassware."
