      "Opening into a long east-west corridor, the entry of the inn tumbles across the expansive lacquered pine flooring towards the semi-circular front desk.  Braziers of bronze and blackened iron occupy the corners, their burning contents providing illumination, warmth, and a spiced pungency to the air.  Gleaming yellow and white in the ambient light, an enormous woolly mammoth skull rests high on the wall behind the desk."
