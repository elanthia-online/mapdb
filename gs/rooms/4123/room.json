      "The width of this tunnel varies along its length, from barely wide enough to crawl through, to about twice your height, but its shape is always a circle, or very near.  The rough stone makes it easy to find footing on the slope, but scrapes your hands, and anything else that might touch it or brush against it.  The deep end of the tunnel is definitely warmer."
