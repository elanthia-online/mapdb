      "Dark and dank enough that the moisture seeps from the stone walls and cobblestone floor, this spot looks eminently defensible.  Portcullises, situated at the outer and inner ends of the walkway, are raised now, but are ready to be lowered at a moment's notice.  Trapdoors open from the ceiling, making the area even less hospitable to unwelcome visitors."
