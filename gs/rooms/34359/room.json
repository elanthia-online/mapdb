      "Huge mud puddles create slick terrain that makes every step hazardous.  The torrential downpour keeps coming, ensuring that the puddles will never disappear.  A softly glowing hemisphere of bright white zorchar rests on the ground, perfectly aligned with one of the obsidian spires of the large ring at the center of the island."
