      "Braided lengths of hempen rope loop across the ceiling of the shop, each one threaded through a series of scrimshawed rings.  Set at the center of the rug-covered room are a set of faenor racks wrought into outstretched branches, the angular boughs decorated with a variety of jewelry, leaving the tapering ends to cast shadows above the lantern-lit floor."
