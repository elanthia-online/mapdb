      "Twilight hues spill through the open windows, giving the dimly light room a bruised appearance that is vivid contrast to the plush carpeting and gold fixtures.  High-backed leather armchairs are arranged in social circles throughout the space, while an elaborately carved cabinet occupies a space along the back wall.  The thick scent of cherry tobacco fills the air."
