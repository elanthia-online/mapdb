      "A tattered map hangs above a mistwood bed with an ornately carved footboard situated near a window that runs the breadth of the stern, the view of the sea beyond superior to any painting hanging on the cocobolo-paneled walls of this well appointed cabin.  The nautical charts strewn across a shadowy black mistwood table tell the ship's history at sea, while the details are all recorded in the log books stacked on an ironwood throne finished with a glossy veneer.  A large sea chest occupies one corner, a lock securing its contents inside."
