      "The sound of moving water is ever present in the gurgling of the stream that follows along the path on the other side of the fence like a devoted traveling companion.  Easing into a comfortable pitch for walking, the slope of the earth underfoot flattens at the valley floor, and the dirt path is embedded with tumbled stones in a nature-made cobbled lane."
