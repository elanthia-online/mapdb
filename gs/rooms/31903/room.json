      "A glimmering green glow courses through large, densely intertwined roots overhead, revealing a circular, hard-packed dirt floor edged with fiery red-yellow toadstools.  Dirt walls glisten from above-ground snowmelt, and the warm, humid air in this half-sphere hollow carries hints of acrid mud.  Beneath some severed hook-ended roots, a gnarled knife block and a lacquered live-edge root bowl sit atop a flat-topped petrified toadstool."
