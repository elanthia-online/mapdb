      "Dark finishes and plush fabrics lend to a cozy atmosphere despite their obvious age and wear.  Directly across from a pair of paneled sliding doors, a large framed Talador map hangs in a place of honor above a small fireplace.  On the west wall, a tall back overstuffed armchair with cracked chocolate leather and large desk face a small sofa and floor-to-ceiling bookcases across the room."
