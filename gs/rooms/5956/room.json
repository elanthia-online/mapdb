      "A crumbling dirt path winds southward through a sea of tall grass, its uneven surface patched with a few scattered remnants of the gravel road which once existed here.  On one side of the old road, a warped and rotting wooden structure sags under its own weight, its demise at the hands of the elements and time clearly arriving soon.",
      "A crumbling dirt path winds southward through a sea of tall grass, its uneven surface patched with a few scattered remnants of the gravel road which once existed here.  Crunching underfoot, the fragile clods of dried soil and the occasional piece of stone provide rugged passage toward the gently sloping hills to the south.  On one side of the old road, a warped and rotting wooden structure sags under its own weight, its demise at the hands of the elements and time clearly arriving soon.",
