      "Smooth marble walls, veined with delicate streaks of green, frame the collection office.  Brass sconces, shaped like graceful swans with outstretched wings, hold aloft glass globes that cast a warm, steady glow over the room.  At the center of the office stands a heavy desk of dark walnut, its surface meticulously inlaid with a mosaic of emerald and gold that forms the Vornavian crest.  Behind the desk, a tall bookshelf displays rows of leather-bound ledgers, each spine embossed with a different year."
