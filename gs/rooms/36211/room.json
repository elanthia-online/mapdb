      "To the north, the terrain rises steeply, creating a gentle waterfall that cascades down into a deep pool.  Here, the waters move in slow, eddying waves that pick up speed the farther south they go.  The banks of the stream are gently sloped and easily accessible, and a carved sign has been placed next to a cluster of vibrant pink and red torch ginger plants."
