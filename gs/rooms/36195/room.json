      "Bright canary yellow walls of canvas drape from the central post, each spread outward and pulled taut to create an open space beneath the conical roof.  Rugs of jute, linen, and flax spread across the wild grass, their woven designs a blend of gold, chocolate brown, and teal.  Metal hooks attached to the supports display a variety of wares, while woven baskets house assorted trinkets."
