      "The piercing snaps of assorted shop banners peel in the volatile sea winds, coaxing the eye to some rear entrances that are kaleidoscopically painted in all manner of colors, languages, and implausible feats of anatomy, though no individual message is even remotely discernable.  Raucous shouts briefly punctuate a delicately lilting background melody, as one of the doors of a high-reaching gold and ivory lighthouse bangs open, then steadily sweeps the laughter away as it eases shut."
