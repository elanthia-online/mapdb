      "Pale blue rays of light trace the edges between the dark interior walls and the low flat ceiling of this solemn chamber.  At the center of the calm space, a sylphlike figure of light poses atop a small circular plinth, its body arced in graceful poise.  Its slender arms extend to cradle a spherical crystal in cupped hands, gaze angled towards the heavens.  While appearing dark and solid, the floor feels a bit spongy.  Two shimmering light blue portals stand on opposite walls."
