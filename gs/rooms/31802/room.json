    "description": [
      "A dark-painted plague of grackles covers the slanted ceiling of the narrow room, their shadowed bodies illuminated by a small caged lantern hanging above a simple blanket-adorned bed.  The weathered floor boards are partially concealed by scattered pieces of clothing, the tattered shreds slipping beneath the loose planks like an open maw, its edges stained rust red.  A cotton-stuffed grackle sits perched above a wrought iron ladder, appearing to gaze over the bed with its glass eyes."
