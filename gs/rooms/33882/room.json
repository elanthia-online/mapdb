      "A street-wide lattice of flora-laden vines is affixed high above the sun-bleached cobblestones, the greenery curtained from opposing balconies, filling the air with the scent of honeysuckle and citrus.  Vibrant veils of star-shaped jasmine flowers frame the entry of an ecru limestone building, highlighting the rich jewels displayed behind a layer of smoky glass.  A collection of mahogany-planked crates flank an iron-arched gate, the insignia-inlaid archway connecting further into the shop."
