      "Soft, swaying grasses carpet the incline between the meandering row and the walls of the citadel above, leaving ample space for elegant brownstone homes and a scattering of storefronts.  Among the tidy procession of businesses, an apothecary's shop with a squared chimney stands out for the garlands of herbs strung from its eaves.  Bay laurel and vervain are woven together in a colorful display of yellow and pink flowers over the front door, which is etched with a stylized mortar and pestle."
