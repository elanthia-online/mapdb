      "The mountain trail ends here, opening into a wide area that provides a good place to rest.  Progress to the west ends with an exposure of several thousand feet.  You notice a wooden beam trellis which runs from this point up the side of the mountain to quite a distance above you.  On one side, a freshwater mountain stream tumbles out of an opening into a pool."
