      "Next to the arch to the northwest, a gnomish contraption rests as a shrine.  A yard-wide wheel has been filled with sand and water, while gears keep the wheel in constant back-and-forth motion.  The blue-dyed water and pristine white sand intermingle, creating a miniature storm within the wheel's confines.  Sitting unobtrusively to the north and west are two bridges offering access to the other towers."
