    "description": [
      "The walls of the assembly hall are paneled with dark wood, and several thick blue rugs are spread about the sturdy wooden floor.  A stage rises up against the far wall, where several armchairs and a high podium stand.  The center of the chamber houses rows of cushioned chairs, and behind them hangs a crisp banner with the crest of a red lion before a crossed hammer and pick on a field of silver."
