      "Thick woolen rugs cover much of the floor, helping to insulate the precious heat generated by the nearby fireplace.  Stocked on handcarved shelves are a variety of supplies necessary for fletching, each item labeled clearly and displayed neatly.  A small window in the western wall offers a glimpse of the torchlight glow upon the blanket of snow on the snowy trees surrounding the cabin.",
