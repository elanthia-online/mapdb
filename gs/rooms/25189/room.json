      "The grey brick facade is in dark contrast to the aged and peeling wood lining the interior of this smoke-filled room.  A circular table, covered with a stained linen cloth, serves as a stage for a trio of filled candle votives, each casting their own dancing shadows across the floor.  Broken bottles of ale surround an unfinished oak cupboard that leans precariously to one side, and a collection of dusty trunks are strewn into one corner.  A hand-painted screen is propped against the wall."
