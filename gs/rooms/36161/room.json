    "description": [
      "Sunk partially into the hull of the ship, the quarters are impeccably cared for with polished wood planks of various species forming a tight-fitting wall to keep the weather and wet out.  A polished oak-framed window, providing a view out of the ship's aft, occupies a space above an intricately carved modwir desk that has a sturdy rolling chair resting in front of it.  Floor to ceiling, a set of glass-faced bookcases dominate the space opposite a tidy overstuffed bed covered in squared clean cotton sheets and a heavily embroidered quilt, while the open veniom door occupies the remaining wall."
