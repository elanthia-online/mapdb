      "Foamy outbursts of white cap rough water that varies in hue from deep teal to midnight blue as a powerful whirlpool is forced upwards from the depths.  The vortex speeds up and slows down at random, but never loses entirely its dizzying energy.  Spinning and swirling in a clockwise direction determined by its own internal makeup, the strong eddy batters against any object with which it comes in close contact."
