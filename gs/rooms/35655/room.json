      "A length of anchor chain is heaped onto the dock, one dangling length clanking insistently against a nearby piling as the waves tug at it.  Rust from the decaying links has stained the wood below an unsavory reddish brown.  Tiny crabs, ghostly white and no larger than an infant's fist, have made the shadows of the abandoned chain their home."
