    "description": [
      "Billowing clouds glide past upon a persistent breeze that brings both a light chill and the scent of desiccated flesh to the air.  Whistling slightly in its passage, the zephyr dances around the defenses spikes recessed into the walls and along the deep cuts of the distant crenellation.   A roughly hewn oak tree insistently taps at a walnut shell it has wedged into the fitted stones of the bulwark.",
      "Dark shadows play across the smooth face of the bulwark as the torches from the west begin to lose their friendly glow at this distance.  Biting winds whip through the air and lend their unearthly voice of that of the pained howls of some craven creature that prowls disturbingly close.  The ravaged remains of a tree that dared to grow too close to the fortress's walls lays discarded in the upturned cobblestones of the ground."
