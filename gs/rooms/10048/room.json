      "The chill wind howls across the damp, boggy ground, sending banks of clinging mist swirling around you like a shroud.  A few gnarled trees stand above the blanket of mist, their charred bark now covered with sickly lichen and their twisted branches grasping at the air like a ghoul's fingers.",
