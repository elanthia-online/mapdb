      "Trees dot the edge of the lane near the Empath Guild, pine and spruce clad in needles that are vividly verdant despite the cold.  The happy trilling of snow birds beckons from their snow-bent boughs.  One bird with bright golden and turquoise plumage sings loudly from atop a juniper laden with dark blue beries, noisily proclaiming his territory to all other avians in the vicinity.",
      "Trees dot the edge of the lane and the happy trill of songbirds fills the air.  Looking for the source of the song, you spot a brightly plumaged bird perched on a branch, singing loudly, proclaiming his territory to all other avians in the vicinity.",
      "Trees dot the edge of the lane and a soft series of hoots fills the air.  Looking for the source of the song, you spot a large, white, snowy owl perched on a branch, proclaiming his territory to all other avians in the vicinity."
