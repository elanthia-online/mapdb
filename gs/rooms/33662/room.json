      "Cloudy crystals rise in shards from the cobblestone floor to form the image of a frozen witch of unsurpassed beauty.  Fragments of the the sculpture have broken free and tumbled into the dusty ground along a single line that divides the room in two distinct portions.  Affixed to the wall above the eastern niche is a small shield-shaped device, while a small tattered banner rests above the western niche."
