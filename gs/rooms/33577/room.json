      "Rippling slightly in the sporadic arctic breezes, the canvas walls of the pavilion are decorated with burgundy, mustard yellow, and ecru stripes.  Rugs are scattered across the ground, though here and there tufts of grass are visible where the seams just barely overlap.  Carefully positioned lanterns illuminate the wares that are for sale on the low mahogany tables."
