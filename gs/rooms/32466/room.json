      "A stone and bloodwood staircase climbs to the second story of the keep, the natural beauty of its ruddy wooden inlay complemented by the grey-trimmed scarlet runners at its center.  Beeswax candles stand in arched nooks along the tenebrous stone walls, illuminating a trio of hallways leading to the castle's living spaces.  The shortest path, to the north, is softened by a dark red carpet with bright golden tassels."
