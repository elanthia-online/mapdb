      "The only thing neat about this room is the precision of the beds being arranged in straight rows.  Blankets are strewn about with some on the bed and some on the floor.  Ripped pieces of paper, covered in bizarre drawings, lay in scattered pieces on the ground.  A pile of dirty clothes surrounds an empty wicker laundry basket in the corner."
