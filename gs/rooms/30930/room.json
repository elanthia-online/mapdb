      "The open patio offers an expansive view of the jungle canopy stretching away into the distance.  Bright color is everywhere, tinting flowers, birds and insects.  A curtain of fragrant honeysuckle vines grows near the table, and small tree frogs can be glimpsed within its protection, their ruby-red eyes an intense contrast to their lime green coloration."
