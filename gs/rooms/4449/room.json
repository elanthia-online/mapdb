      "The roughly hewn walls open up to the central area of the dimly torch-lit shop.  Dominating the center of the room, a maoral table sits offering an assortment of wares, with a pair of mannequins flanking it on either side.  A dusty rug covers the majority of the floor, while iron-sconced torches flicker and gutter along the outer walls."
