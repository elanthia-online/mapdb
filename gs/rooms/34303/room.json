      "Boot treads of recent travelers form intricate criss-crossed designs across the muddy pathway in a dizzying array.  Groups of voices can barely be heard beneath the sound of the driving rain, but the inability to locate their source preserves the mystery.  Carved from petrified tree bark, a large composition sits just off the trail and is turned slightly torward the north."
