      "Anchored by spikes hidden amid a ring of river reed baskets, a central support post rises from the center of the space to create a peak of mottled canvas.  Tiny glaesine orbs dangle from braided hemp coils that spiral out from the tall post towards the smooth walls, each blinking as if fireflies are trapped within them.  The dim lighting is just enough to make out the various parchments stored on a nearby oak table and within a towering oak bookcase."
