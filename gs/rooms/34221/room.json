    "description": [
      "An uneven gash heralds a tunnel mouth in the eastern wall of the cavern, its descending spiral quickly winding out of sight.  Strands of thick, glutinous fiber cling to the entrance, fluttering like incongruous ribbons in the shifting air currents of the subterrane.  The spongy ground before the maw is scored with scratches, some darkened with blood, marking clear signs of a desperate struggle."
