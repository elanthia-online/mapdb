      "This stretch of passage echoes with rustling, clicking and scuttling noises.  Your boots crunch with each step you take.  You get a horrible, sick suspicion in the pit of your stomach, which is confirmed when hundreds of crawly little feet start climbing up your legs.  You imagine suffocating under a mountain of insects and feel slightly sick to your stomach."
