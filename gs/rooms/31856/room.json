    "description": [
      "Tendrils of smoky incense rise from a hammered copper bowl recessed into the ground at the heart of the shop, the cloying vapor at times sweetly scented and at others thick and noxious.  Melted candle wax drips from the rafters where hundreds of spent votives create a small graveyard that is faintly illuminated by the surviving tallows.  Midway down the wall, a rough oak shelf wraps around the room beneath a plethora of painted handprints in black, white, and blood-red hues."
