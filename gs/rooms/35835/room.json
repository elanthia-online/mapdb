      "Mist drifts faintly overhead, its glow pooling against the curve of the northern wall where the exedra reaches its terminus.  From the south, the view frames the sarcophagus beyond, its silhouette softened by haze.  Along the wall, a curved stone bench juts outward, carved from the same blocks that formed the mausoleum itself.  Hundreds of pillar and votive candles cover its surface, their wavering flames casting restless shadows.  Near the apex rises a towering statue, a small altar nestled at its feet."
