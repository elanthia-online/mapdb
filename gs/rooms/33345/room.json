      "The gentle plink of water drops echoes throughout the room, the air thick with steam.  Scattered along the black tile floor are opalescent pillar candles, their gentle flames highlighting silver flecks embedded in walls painted in twilight hues.  A path of polished river stones leads from a silk-draped arch towards a large travertine bath nestled within an enclosure of varnished maoral.  In each corner, tall obsidian vases hold gold-painted tree limbs, their lengths stripped of excess twigs."
