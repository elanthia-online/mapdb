      "This floor holds the rooms of the House Officers and other senior members.  It is richly panelled in fine woods, and thick woven rugs cover the floor.  A staircase leads down to the lower floors.  A row of multi-paned windows gives light during the day, and a small table holds brass oil lamps and candles for use at night."
