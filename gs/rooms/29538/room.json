      "Lit by a quartet of heavy silver candelabras, the chambers are a spacious, windowless stone den with lush tapestries hanging from the walls.  The hangings muffle echoes in the chamber to a muted whisper.  Spaced around a paneled hoarbeam table are a number of patterned leather chairs, each well-maintained.  The sole means of egress from the chamber appears to be a pair of Ossian pine doors, each marked with a rampant mule in silver."
