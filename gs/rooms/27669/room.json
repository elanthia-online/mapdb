      "Large grainy cedar double doors occupy the entire eastern wall of this room with a large silver plaque placed just above them.  A glance through the propped open doors yields a view of a spacious, modern auditorium, and voices from all along the westerly corridor echoing throughout the torchlit hallway seem to become diminished here.  Occasionally, someone passes through a small rounded door off to the side."
