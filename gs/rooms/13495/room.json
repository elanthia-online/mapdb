      "Small niches are set into the white plastered walls at regular intervals from floor to ceiling.  Many of the niches hold small white votive candles, while others house small statues of Koar, Phoen, Kai and Eonak.  A narrow monir door, heavily carved with a scene depicting Koar upon a massive throne, occupies the center of the wall."
