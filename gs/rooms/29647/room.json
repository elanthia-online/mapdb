    "description": [
      "Forest green oilcloth edged in canary yellow falls in unfettered folds from several support posts that are spaced equidistantly apart.  Bronze bowls suspended from matching chains house small, fragrant fires that help to illuminate the various wares that are on display.  Woven baskets decorate the center of the entry, the carefully arranged containers creating twin pathways opposite them that lead deeper into the tent, while a long quilt rack behind them houses a variety of folded plaid bundles."
