    "description": [
      "An immense rocky outcropping rises from the ground, its surface covered in moss and vines.  A large hollow has been carved out from one side of the rock by a bubbling pool of boiling water.  A large gush of water occasionally bursts from the pool, slamming the top of the outcropping, leaving the water to drip down and form a small stream that flows east and southeast.  Steam roils forth from the scalding liquid, leaving the air hot and humid."
