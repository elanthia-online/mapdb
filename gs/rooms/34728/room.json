      "Gold-flecked ebon paving stones wind through the foreboding metal gates, weaving beneath red-leafed lor trees and twisted rowans that claw like taloned silhouettes at the daylit sky, casting snatching shadows on the dark earth.  Golden moonflowers grow alongside banks of night-blooming black jasmine, peeking from among the lightless flowers like watching eyes.  Its entrance marked by a stylized jackal head of amber, a temple with a black marble facade lurks beneath the shadows of the trees."
