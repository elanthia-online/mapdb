      "An ebony-planked stand has been nestled beneath a canopy of leather and waxed linen, its lacquered surface covered in half-rolled maps and parchment, each weighted by an aged gold astrolabe.  Iron-riveted barrels sit beside the map-covered stand, the cylindrical containers encircled by braided coils of hempen rope.  A faenor-framed board board of black slate sits beneath the reinforced canopy, nearly engulfed in corkscrews of heartleaf that wends down across its riveted legs and across the boardwalk."
