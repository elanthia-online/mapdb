      "An overwhelming pile of clutter that threatens to bury a rather small enruned fel desk dominates the room.  An overhead candelabra composed of small glowing crystals emits a cheery light, illuminating the desk.  A small brass plaque is fastened on the far wall next to a dusty obsidian sconce, while a series of names are inscribed directly upon another."
