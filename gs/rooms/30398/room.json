      "Pinched between the high cliffs of the isle and the sharp, angular sides of the Teeth of Charl, the narrow strait creates a small passage between the eastern and northern sides of the island.  As the two waterways collide the water becomes rough and frothy, though they calm greatly beyond the pinched channel."
