      "A large, circular chamber yawns at the barrow's end, lit by roaring violet and crimson flames roaring from torches in sconces around the room.  Crudely carved from porous black stone is a squat, misshapen figure with membranous bat-like wings.  He stands atop a defaced altar of crimson-stained stone.  Staring down at the scene is a three-faced etching in the wall that has been slashed and raked so badly as to be almost unrecognizable."
