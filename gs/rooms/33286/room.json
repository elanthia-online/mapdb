      "Golden bars of alternating heights are joined by cross-beams as a barrier on the edges of the square platform.  In the center, cobblestone pavers spiral outward from a tall iron lampost with a timeless statue in front of it.  The platform seemingly drifts along in a endless, soundless darkness.  In the corner on a raised pedestal is a large dark sign."
