      "Ivory-weighted banners of pavonated silk are suspended high above the silver-gilt staircase, the muted fabric embroidered in peahens framed by arabesque-beaded plumage.  A duo of heavy-handled doors stand below the curved ascent, each haon-crafted panel flanked by an armored member of the Sapphire Guard standing still above the cool stone floor.  The sounds of footsteps echo throughout the hall, followed by the muffled sounds of whispers from behind the chamber beyond."
