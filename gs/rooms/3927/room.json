      "A litter of boulders lies on either side of a faint trail leading through the tunnels.  By their placement, the stones possess the quality of having been deliberately positioned.  Surrounding them is fine, white sand, providing a pleasing contrast to striations visible in the rocks.  Here and there along the path, stepping-stones are visible, their surface abraded over time to a mere suggestion that a pattern was once carved upon them."
