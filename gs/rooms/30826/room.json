      "As the water flows in and out, the sand shifts, occasionally revealing glowing runes upon a hard surface.  The near-constant fluctuation of wave and sand make it impossible to determine the nature of either the material hidden beneath the sands or its lambent symbols.  A sandbar is visible to the southwest, and a precarious bridge of rockpiles leads southeasterly.  The sand levels out, creating a path heading straight for the atoll, the lush tropical foliage of the beach retreating in the distance.",
      "As the water shifts in and out, glowing runes are visible along a much harder surface beneath the sand.  The sand levels out as the path heads straight for the atoll, the once lush tropical foliage of the beach now gone from view."
