      "Something has decided to dine on the barley plants here.  Hoofed tracks in the flanking trench show that a heavy beast came through the barley traveling south.  From the chewed appearance of the plants, it took its time filling its belly.  Many of the plants have been consumed right down to the soil level, while many others display ripped and torn leaves.  Crushed plants indicate the beast moved off to the southeast, perhaps to the turnip fields for an after-dinner dessert."
