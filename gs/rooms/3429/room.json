      "The rear entrance to the gaming hall is nearly as resplendent as its main one.  Espaliered wintercrisp apple trees grow to either side of the massive dark modwir doors.  Bright green apples weigh down their branches, but not a single fruit has been suffered to splatter the cobblestones below.  A smiling attendant in silver and blue waves at passerby.",
