      "Carved in a proud pose, a hooded stone statue presides over a cluster of longhouses near the heart of the village.  Offerings of whalebone and copper are heaped at the figure's feet, far beneath its implacable gaze.  Taller than the statue by far, a sprawling hoarbeam tree to the southwest claws at the sky, its grasping branches casting hazy shadows over the surrounding homes' sloping rooftops."
