      "Dank and dark, the cavern smells of loam, dirt, and something unidentifiable but sweet.  Root tendrils dangle from above, their spidery fingers casting shadows on the ground due to the flickering of the three torches positioned around a spindled copper-bound ladder.  Framed in ebonwood, widowwood, and driftwood, an ancient story wall displays colorful painted panels of a time gone by."
