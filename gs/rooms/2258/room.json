      "The vast chamber is starkly uncluttered, save for a strange formation of glaes that extends from the center of a pool of magma.  With its grotesque appendages, it seems to reach from the heart of the hissing magma like a misshapen claw clenched in agony.  From the 'palm' of the thing, a slow rivulet of viscous black liquid pulses out, dripping down over the gnarled surface of the outcropping and pooling on the roiling face of the bubbling glaes."
