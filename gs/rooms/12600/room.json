      "Cold glassy walls close in on either side and the wind whistles between with increased ferocity.  The floor drops rapidly to the west.  For a moment it occurs to you that travelling down is much easier than travelling up.  There is no sound but the screaming of the evil wind, and somewhere, almost lost beneath it, the beating of your heart."
