      "A constant stream of passengers flows through this long, narrow room, transmitting a nervous energy as they bustle on their way to or from the loading docks.  A small queue has formed in front of the ticket windows, where elves and sullen dwarves wait impassively, with a smattering of humans and other outlanders among them.  Those with tickets move intently up a wide staircase to one side.  At the other end of the room, porters come and go through a broad archway, bearing light cargo of various sorts."
