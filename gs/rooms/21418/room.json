      "Towering wyrmwood trees rise to the southeast, but discontinue their progress to the east at the edge of plank-lined walkway.  Small bushes take up every available space in the absence of the colossal beauties, their tightly packed limbs no less verdant than their taller cousins.  The sound of laughter and the scent of roasting meats rises on the air, its source unknown."
