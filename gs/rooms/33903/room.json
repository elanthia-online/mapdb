      "Ribbons of silk suspend ebony picture frames across the pale tea green walls, the glass-paned ovals portraying silhouettes adorned with various pieces of elaborate jewelry, the finery held in place by diminutive pewter pins.  The faenor-framed counter displays several lengths of chain and cushion-affixed pins, the mixed metals neatly labeled next to each vertical row.  A ceiling-high mirror of carved haon is flanked by arched windows, the trio veiled in graduated drapes of heart-shaped ivy."
