      "A small white marble dais occupies the center of the modest theatre.  Plush velvet-covered cushions rest on the rows of benches that hug the curved walls, creating an intimate setting between audience and speaker.  An intricate, diamond-cut crystal chandelier is suspended over the dais, casting prismatic rainbows across the white marble.  A small faewood sideboard sits near a varnished mahogany door, a pumpkin-hued ash door opposite it."
