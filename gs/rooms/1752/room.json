      "The snow is nearly impassable, piling up several yards high around most of the large pines and firs in the area.  A thick, damp fog wraps itself around the trees, limiting vision to only a few yards.  To compound the sight problem, snow seems to constantly fall from the clouds.  The forceful wind is modified somewhat by the trees, but it still carries away quite a bit of snow.  If not for its action, it is possible that the entire forest would soon become one giant snow lump."
