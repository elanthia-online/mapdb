      "Stalactites of blue-white ice glisten dangerously overhead, reflected clearly in the mirror-like floor.  Someone or something flits around the formations with only a faint whirring indicating its presence.  A bower crafted of sticks and twine stands in the cavern's center, encrusted with silvery rime.",
      "Dull, grey stone is slick with dampness underfoot.  Someone or something flits around in the distant shadows, with only a faint whirring indicating its presence.  A bower crafted of sticks and twine stands in the cavern's center, singed black."
