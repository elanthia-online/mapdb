      "Tall pillars sprout from beds of catswort along a broad path that sweeps from the gates of the compound toward a low sandstone temple in the near distance.  Two long reflecting pools reside amidst the thriving greenery, brilliantly colored carp flashing in their wavering depths.  Cinnamon and sandalwood trees shade verdant ferns and other exotics, perfuming the air with their commingled scent.  Glimpses of soft earth through the abundant flora evidence the passage of small tracks through the undergrowth."
