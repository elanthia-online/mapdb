      "A brisk wind blows down the street, shivering the branches of evergreens along the roadside.  The road comes to a sharp corner in front of a marvelous two-story bakery.  Countless small windows with white shutters peek out of the brick facade of the shop, and a polished silver plaque is affixed next to the door.  Woodsmoke billows gently from the stone chimney, though its bite is sweetened by the aroma of baked goods.",
      "Trader's Way comes to a sharp corner here, in front of a marvelously grand bakery.  Painted bright pink, the front of the shop is decorated with numerous tiny windows outlined with white shutters.  A polished silver plaque hangs next to the door."
