      "Pupae twitch and shudder in tall, leathery chrysalises that occupy much of the plaza.  The plump, spindle-shaped sacs are mostly muddy-hued and unsightly, but they are dotted in places with bright patches of iridescent orange, red, and gold that flash brighter than jewels in the ambient light.  Several spent casings litter the stone edifice, dry, dull, and decaying with their purpose having been served."
