      "Virid vegetation covers the rolling earth, ripe with fanning ferns and leafy laurels.  Unusually immense, green ball dianthus speckle the abundant verdure with shaggy, lime-hued domes.  The lush greenery is shot with sprigs of chartreuse orchids, their labella blushed a rich cerise shade.  Emitting a pale inner glow, tiny spheres dart through gaps in the flora."
