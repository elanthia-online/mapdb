      "The treacherous path crosses the wall of stone, snaking through lurking pitfalls and dangerous cracks camouflaged with sheets of ice and snow.  To the north, the boulders descend and flatten into a tundra marked with little more than shifting snowbanks.  A great peak cuts through the mist of the far northern horizon like a forbidding mirage floating in the clouds of snow."
