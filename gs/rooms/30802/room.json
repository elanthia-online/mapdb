      "Situated high above the deck and the shrouds of the mast, a simple platform is afforded the best view on the ship.  Through an open trapdoor, rope ladders sway in the breeze, the only means of escape to the main deck below.  A shiny brass spyglass is swivel-mounted to the narrow railing surrounding the crows nest."
