      "Rough-hewn wooden walls display nautical maps, charts, and maritime tools hung with care.  An old weathered wood desk scarred with use occupies one corner, piled with logbooks, a brass compass, and a lantern for late-night work.  Opposite, a simple cot with a woolen blanket offers a place to sleep.  Shelves line the walls, filled with jars of ship supplies, spare parts, and weathered books.  Sunlight filters through a long rectangular window, casting a warm glow across the room."
