      "Shield-sized leaves fall across the eastern edge of the path, their wide expanses creating dark shadows all about.  Water, collected from somewhere high above, cascades across the glossy expanses of each verdant leaf and eventually trickles towards the mossy carpet of the jungle where it forms smaller pools.  Though not visible, the faint chirp of a cricket fills the air with its soft melodic song."
