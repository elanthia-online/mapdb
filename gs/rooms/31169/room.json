      "Converging upon one another, blue-green grasses share space along the slightly descending trail with dwarf pampas grass that is festooned with bright white flower plumes.  Lemon and crimson bottlebrush extend their vibrant heads from along the southerly trails, their long flowers bouncing and swaying with the slightest movement near their leaves.  A thin birch tree stretches towards the sky, its distant limbs offering a modicum of shade to the area."
