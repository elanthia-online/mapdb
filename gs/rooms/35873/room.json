      "The cobblestones of the promenade come to a sudden end, transitioning into a rugged gravel road.  Alongside the road is a narrow stream that gushes forth from a bubbling hot spring, its surface layered with roiling fog.  A stout stone mill resides between the promenade and the spring, its waterwheel turning steadily in the rushing waters.  Berry-laden bushes grow between mushroom-covered mangroves along the opposite bank."
