      "Tufted blue-green grass trails down a slope to the northwest, the tall blades providing a splash of green coloring amid the grey rocks and beige bulrush that surrounds a nearby pond.  Gravel and loose stones line the short shoreline where the water laps, while large boulders mottled with rust-red lichen watch on.  Patches of mountain laurel trickle in from the south."
