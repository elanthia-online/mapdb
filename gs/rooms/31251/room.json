      "A foul odor and crazed screams fill the air of this entire corridor.  Strands of cobwebs hang from the ceiling and brush against exposed skin.  At the base of a rusty metal barred door lies a dead mouse next to a mousetrap that has not been used.   Some pieces of bloodstained padding are stuck to the bottom of the other barred door."
