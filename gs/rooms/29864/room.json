      "To the north, a thin ribbon of silver winks at the edges of eyesight.  The river stretches wide enough that its far shore is lost in the mist and sleet that drapes heavily upon the world.  Through the racing clouds overhead, an aurora ripples across the sky, gold and green and royal blue, and its colors shimmer off of the distant water's surface invitingly."
