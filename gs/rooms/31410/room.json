      "Despite the fact the walls are nothing more than layered scraps of wood nailed together, this structure somehow manages to stay upright.  A scuffed wooden bar stretches across the back wall with a line of crooked hooks hanging above it, both displaying wares for sale.  A dingy wooden crate is shoved into a corner, its lid open wide.  The air is still with the sharp aroma of alcohol permeating the cramped confines."
