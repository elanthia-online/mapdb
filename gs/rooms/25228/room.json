      "[Sea of Fire, The Hammer's Base]"
    ],
    "description": [
      "The true and incredible scope of the hammer-shaped spire of rock is apparent when viewed from the ragged terrain at its base.  It stretches up into the sky, many times the height of a man, as colorful and beauteous as it is deadly.  Lying amidst the jagged stones is a pile of sun-bleached bones, though whether the remains are an offering or merely evidence of an unwary traveler is unclear."
