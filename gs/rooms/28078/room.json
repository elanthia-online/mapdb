      "A petrified tree stump and a long ashen branch dominate this otherwise sparse section of the tent.  Gem-like objects shine in the reflected light atop the white stump's surface, while glittering jewelry dangles off the branch.  A small notice affixed to the tent's wall near the stump calls your attention.",
