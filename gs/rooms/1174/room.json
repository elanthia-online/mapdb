    "description": [
      "The bluff trail above has tumbled down into the river and been washed away, leaving large rocks protruding up through the rushing waters near to the sheer dropoff.  Atop the bluff trees crowd the edge, denying passage, their roots extending out in a futile attempt to grasp the soil that is no longer there.  With great care it might be possible to move along the cliff from rock to rock, but a misstep could prove cold and wet if not outright fatal.  The river does not look to be in a forgiving mood."
