      "The backs of tall statues flanking the Path of Glory loom over the comparatively humble storefronts along Razorfin Road.  There is little glory to be found on the street; only fish, but they exist in plenitude, filling the bellies of carts chained up in front of a variety of businesses dependent upon the sea's bounty.  Gulls, lured away from the island's shores by the prospect of an easy meal, circle over the street, filling the air with their cries and drenching the rooftops with their droppings."
