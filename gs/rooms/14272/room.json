      "A few windows are inset high into the walls around you, their surfaces bearing untold years of dirt and other accumulated grit.  Crates are stacked next to or in front of some of the more weathered-looking doors here, and numerous bits of garbage are liberally piled in a haphazard fashion around them.  Ragged stains that are clearly not from water or mud mar the ground here, the only thing clearly visible through the covering of refuse."
