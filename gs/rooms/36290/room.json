    "description": [
      "Nestled between two radiating arcs of the lodge, the garden stretches across a pristine flora-filled lawn to the edge of a bubbling hot spring.  Swirling mists of steam rising from the water obscure a small gazebo.  Translucent lanterns sway in the breeze, casting dancing lights across the garden.  White wooden benches topped with cozy floral cushions offer comfortable seating near a silver serving cart.  A glass panel leads inside the lodge."
