      "Sunlight slants across the crystal blue waters and brightly illuminates the floor of the watercourse as it makes its way around a small island.  Here and there, guests to the waters ride ferries or pedal boats either further out into the harbor or closer to the docks where others stand waiting.  A lone balloon with string still attached hovers near to the ocean and drifts where the wind wills it.",
      "Moonlight slants across the crystal blue waters creating shadows in the watery depths that are only enhanced by the gentle lapping of the waves.  The sporadic call of a guard, from somewhere on the nearby docks, echoes over the water as he calls out the hours of the night."
