      "Splendid organic lines of vaalin frame bulbous, misted glass panes that rise high overhead, culminating in an ogee formation, with many-rayed starburst chandeliers dangling at the peak.  Mistydeep riverstones encircle a shallow pool filled with lily pads, while a central seating area with blued wrought iron tables and chairs filters out into mossy, slate paths curving around the clumping lasimor specimen.  Whorl-spindled balustrades line a short series of steps toward the stained glass doors inset with a pair of pavonated peacocks leading back inside the keep."
