      "Woven from soft wool, a dark green carpet covers the ground.  Polished oak poles form the framework of the large tent with rich gold wool draped over to create the roof and walls.  A series of copper lanterns dangle from a braided rope, their bright lights fill the large space.  Several wooden bins are pushed to one side with a few woven baskets hanging from above."
