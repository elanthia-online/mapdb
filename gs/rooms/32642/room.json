      "Twenty or more thick granite pillars shaped in the same rolling mode as the walls, floor and ceiling support this spacious room.  No seams or right angles are apparent.  Four polished wood racks with long, rounded wooden bars on either side are attached to each pillar.  The gelatinous mass on the ceiling has expanded to cover the entire roof area, and the electrical discharges weaken considerably as they spread out over the larger surface.  A globe rests on the floor next to each rack."
