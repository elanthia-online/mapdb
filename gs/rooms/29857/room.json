      "The four corners of this brightly colored marquee are elevated upon spiraling glaesine poles, each polished to a gleaming perfection.  Scraggly crabgrass makes up the floor, and a steady trickle of customers has worn a goat path from the entrance to a halfmoon table piled high with a hoard of cloaks, bags, and other sundries."
