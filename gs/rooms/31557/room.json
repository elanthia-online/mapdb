      "Sunlight streams through a large triangular skylight directly over the center of the salon, bringing out the golden flecks in the stark white marble flooring.  Two mannequins in flamboyant poses stand on either side of an emerald-encrusted white gold rack.  Elaborately carved with gold-veined roses, an intentionally asymmetrical black marble counter with a small engraved silver sign sits against one wall.  A glimpse of a rose garden is visible beyond a glass door."
