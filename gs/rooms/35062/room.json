      "Bone charms swing from the entrance to a midnight blue canvas tent, though their clacking is nearly lost in the symphony of haggling and peddling filling the air.  It and several carriages almost obscure the view of some steel pens along the bazaar's wall that have been left to rust and ruin.  Customers laden with fresh purchases swirl like detritus down the narrow pathway before the tent, but most give it wide berth."
