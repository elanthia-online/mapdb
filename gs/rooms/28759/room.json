      "The broad sweep of the granite floor is interrupted by a woven Vornavian silk rug.  Halfway to the white cedar ceiling, a curl-edged vellum wall map hangs on one of the rough white stucco walls.  A plank-covered barrel table and a long brass clothing rack are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
