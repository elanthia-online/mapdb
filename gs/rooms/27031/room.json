    "description": [
      "Town citizens mill about the open space of the tent, weaving in between the support poles and engaging in idle chatter.  A few individuals cluster near a large announcement board, gossiping loudly.  The distinct smell of freshly baked tarts wafts from a snowflake-carved modwir refreshment cart in one corner of the room.  Near the rear of the tent, an icicle-engraved fel box stocked with tinder rests next to an iron brazier.  The atmosphere lends a potential respite from the cold just outside."
