      "The night blue starsilk of the pavilion has been draped with artfully twisted rays of yellow, orange, and pink naraina radiating out from a shimmering ball of bright yellow silk at the ceiling's apex.  Several swathes have been hand-painted with scenes of Atan Irith life, including a detailed depiction of Inyexat riding capybaras through a valley.  A luck agate-inlaid table and a mereagate stand perch atop a thick captiql rug at the center of the room."
