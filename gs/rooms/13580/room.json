      "The broad sweep of the light pine floor is interrupted by an oily black kraken statue.  Halfway to the driftwood ceiling, a thrown weapons shadowbox hangs on one of the knotty oak-paneled walls.  Some wrought-iron hooks and an oversized sea chest are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
