      "A cylindrical dark crystal chandelier casts a starburst pattern across a vaulted ceiling and pale cream-colored walls illuminating a pair of ebonwood double doors.  Flanked by potted direblooms, a satinwood console table bears a silver tray stacked with sealed envelopes and a burnished brass call bell.  Freshly polished, a faint trace of lemon wax drifts up from a dark-stained, basketweave parquet floor."
