      "Thorn-covered vines wind their way across the ground and up each tree, strangling the forest in an unforgiving grasp.  Complex cobwebs decorate each branch, their skilled weavers veiled in dark shadows.  A smidge of light sneaks through an opening overhead, but is quickly snuffed by the shifting forest, leaving the area in near darkness."
