      "This rocky ledge sits below the rim of the volcanic crater along the top of Stormbrow's outer slope.  Kharam Dzu can be seen to the south and the coast of the Turamzzyrian Empire far to the east.  Access to the crater rim can be gained by climbing the slide to the northwest or by a short climb north."
