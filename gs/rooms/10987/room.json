      "Tufts of cottony stuffing, long-handled mithril scissors, loops of heavy thread, and unwound bolts of velvet and brocade litter every available bit of space in this back room.  Lining the two long walls, rows of chairs in various states of completion display a lesson in the art of chair making.  Pearly moonlight streams in through the large window at the far end of the room.",
