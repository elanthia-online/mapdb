      "The only light seeps in from lanterns hung on pitted iron hooks, their flames flickering against the curved wooden ribs of the hull.  Thick beams cross overhead, reinforced with iron bolts and streaked with rust from years at sea.  Wooden barrels and casks dominate the hold, stacked and roped together for stability while crates of tools, ropes, and sailcloth are wedged between larger items against the bulkheads.  A heavy locker has been carefully placed atop a small oak counter alongside one wall."
