      "A sword, long since rusted into worthlessness, lies mostly covered in dirt on the floor.  Dings, nicks, and other signs of hard use riddle the edge, and the pommel's wood has gone to dust.  Gash marks in the dirt of the walls suggest a battle long in the past, although who the combatants were has since been forgotten."
