      "A long redwood bench sits at the far rear of the airship, framed by a railing with rounded edges that embraces the squared aft of the ship.  Far enough away from the ceaseless drone of the main propellers to be almost quiet, the deck provides a view of the steering blades situated midway down the ship's aft hull.  Beyond them is a dizzying view of the earth below."
