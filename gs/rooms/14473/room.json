      "Waves of yellowed grass cover the savannah habitat to the west.  A smudge of green growth marks where a watercourse cuts through the dry landscape.  Similar earthy tones can be seen opposite the savannah, viewed through the leaded glass wall of the immense dome that occupies the center of the zoo.",

Similar earthy tones can be seen opposite the savannah, viewed through the translucent glaes wall of the immense dome that occupies the center of the zoo.",
      "Waves of grass that cover the savannah habitat to the west are ocean-dark in the dim light of the moons.  A smudge of leafy growth marks where a watercourse cuts through the dry landscape.  The moonlight reflects dimly off the glaes wall of the immense dome that occupies the center of the zoo."
