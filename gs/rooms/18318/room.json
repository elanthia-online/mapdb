      "Though the current is not quite so rough here as the lagoon stretches further from the waterfall, the off-white foam created by the rushing water still collects thickly at the nearby shoreline.  A chilly night breeze drifts across the lagoon, carrying with it the exotic scents of nocturnal flowers, and causing the glassy surface of the water to ripple in the moonlight.  Shadows encase a table occupying the shore, though glimaerflies flash their brilliant lights in and around the umbrella from time to time."
