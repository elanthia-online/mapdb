      "The cool shade and air generated by the dense woods directly north of the path provide a disturbing counterpoint to the uneasy shadow of the high, square keep due south.  Its visage seems to haunt you at every turn, like the sinister gnomon of some giant sundial, ticking off each remaining moment of your mortal life."
