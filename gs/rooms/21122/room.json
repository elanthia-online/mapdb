      "[Shadowed Clearing]"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Dense canopy surrounds this small clearing encasing it in cool dark shadow.  Thin white mist enshrouds a stained stone slab that is surrounded by tiny black gravel in the center of the clearing.  No living thing disturbs the silent grip that stillness holds on this secret, hidden glen.  Over the slab, three small orbs slowly hover, spinning around each other and casting a faint silvery light that mutes nearby colors into varied shades of pale whites, cool grays, and pitch blacks.  Between two trees is an arch of tangled boughs."
