      "Meandering past beds of colorful flowers and shrubs, the path runs parallel to a small, bubbling brook whose banks are lined with ferns.  A gently arched wooden bridge arches over the brook, offering a picturesque crossing.  Nearby, a delicate wind chime made of seashells creates a gentle melody when manipulated by the sea air."
