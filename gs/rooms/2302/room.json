      "The silvery sheen of a statue to the north glints merrily over the heads of most passersby.  Halflings and sylvankind in the deep blue elk hide livery of the Silvermule Gaming Hall rush past, messenger bags thumping against their sides as they race off to deliver letters and missives.  Most of the houses and businesses to either side of the street are built from grey stone, but their doors are brightly painted with a hodgepodge of colors.  An incongruous stone doorframe stands off to the side of the street.",
      "A silvery sheen from something up north catches your eye over the heads of the crowds.  No matter the time of day or night, this stretch of road always seems busy.  A young halfling girl, dressed in the livery of the Silvermule Gaming Hall, rushes past you to deliver a message."
