      "A few small houses line the street here, their quaint and plain architecture overshadowed by the large wall of the Beacon Tower looming to the north.  Faint trails of smoke pour from the stunted little chimneys poking from underneath the building's wooden-shingled roofs, and the mild scent of cooking food drifts through the surroundings."
