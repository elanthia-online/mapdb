      "A single huge stalactite descends from the ceiling at the center of this small cavern.  The uneven walls of the cavern have been worn smooth, as have the walls of the small tunnels leading into the cavern.  Every minute or so, the intense quiet of the cavern is shattered by the sound of a single drop of water, falling from the tip of the stalactite into a small pool that has collected in a depression at the center of the cavern."
