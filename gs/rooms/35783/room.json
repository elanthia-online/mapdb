      "Behind the tavern, a wide stone patio stretches out toward the jagged northern horizon, where the night sky dances with shifting curtains of auroral light.  The vividly hued ribbons ripple through the low clouds, casting faint, ethereal hues across the snow.  At the patio's center, a large firepit burns bright, its crackling flames holding the cold at bay.  Fur-covered benches ring the blaze, their surfaces worn smooth by years of constant occupancy beneath the stars."
