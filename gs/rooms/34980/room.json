      "A rocky jetty stretches out into the forbidding waters of the Frostmain, the crevices and cracks between stones home to hardy crabs and small seabirds.  The latter have built nests of dry tundra grass here and there, and the red of the nests stands out sharply from the volcanic stone.  Though slick with spray, the rocks provide ample footholds."
