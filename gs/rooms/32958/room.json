      "Carved into the riverstone, this massive hall is large enough to serve as the center of activity.  Small groups gather in the various seating areas carved into the walls and rising from the floor.  The congregating Khanshael appear to be largely merchants, craftsmen, and traders of all sorts, some engaged in loud, boisterous conversation, some huddled quietly together.  Two large doors, one steel-banded and the other of reinforced silver, lead deeper into the keep, while a rectangular cast iron gate is flanked by a pair of stout Khanshael guardsmen."
