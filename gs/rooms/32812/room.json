      "The pier comes to an end over the crashing waters of Solhaven Bay, flanked by two high wooden pilings.  The din of North Market to the southeast is all but quelled by the winds of the night sea, and the crisp scent of saltwater swirls in eddies on the chill air.  A vast, dark expanse of water lies in near-pitch darkness as far as the eye can see, broken only by the white crests of waves and the glittering motes of reflected celestial bodies."
