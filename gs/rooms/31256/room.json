      "The austere appearance of this corridor lends to the rigid atmosphere of the entire asylum.  This section of the hallway has a bit more activity with inmates who occasionally run by.  A few benches are firmly secured to the floor along the perimeter.  The wall at the end of the hall has a chalky door outline with bits of cracked and crumbling stone in the center."
