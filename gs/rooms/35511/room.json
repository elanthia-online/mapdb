      "Multiple hand-made posters showcasing a variety of recipes are displayed on the walls throughout the room.  Hung just above a long wooden countertop are cabinets made of dark-stained oak.  The middle of the kitchen is occupied by a large kitchen island, which features an oversized steel basin that provides ample space for working.  Several lengthy wooden racks are positioned next to a completely stocked pantry."
