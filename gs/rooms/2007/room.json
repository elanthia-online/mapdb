      "The ground slopes downward toward the sound of waves breaking gently in the distance.  The air is tangy with salt even in the preternatural stillness of the mysterious and ancient wood.  Somewhere far above, a shrill cry echoes into the endless sky.  Closer by, muffled grunts and a crash of breaking wood mark the passing of large beasts.",
      "The ground slopes downward toward the sound of waves breaking gently in the distance.  The air is tangy with salt even in the preternatural stillness of the mysterious and ancient wood.  Somewhere far above, a seabird cries out into the endless sky.  Closer by, muffled grunts and a crash of breaking wood mark the passing of large beasts."
