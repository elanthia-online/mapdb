      "Cool air seems to radiate from the large basalt slab that serves as bed but looks, for all the world, like a bier, giving the room a funereal cast.  Manacles, anxious to slowly gnaw upon the spirit of another captive, hang expectant against the basalt walls which seem to suck the light from the very air."
