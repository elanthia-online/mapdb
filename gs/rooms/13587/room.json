      "An intricate knot-worked wall-hanging hangs on one of the plain wooden walls, and an uneven wooden ceiling rises overhead.  A worn rug sits in one corner of a plain cherrywood floor.  There is a large cherrywood cabinet on one side of the shop and a iron-bound ebonwood chest on the other.",
      "Beneath a high arched ceiling, a pair of crossed cavalry sabers hangs on one of the textured black silk walls.  An engraved pine case and an intricately carved ebonwood stand sit in opposite corners while a suit of golden armor rests on a parquet red maple floor."
