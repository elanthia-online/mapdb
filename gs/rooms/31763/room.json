      "Clustered shrubs cling to the steep, grassy walls of the hillock the twining path snakes around, their twisted limbs holding clusters of mustard yellow blossoms under the watchful gaze of tidy dwellings.  To the west, dark shadows play upon the grassy land as knotted trees threaten to choke passage into a small wood that stretches from the tower hillock to the neighborhood's encircling fence.  A small wooden sign post rests at the bend in the path, a small wicker basket of torches at its feet."
