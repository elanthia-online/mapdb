      "A short, stone-worked retaining wall emerges from the ground to the west, growing taller and more stable as it stretches eastward.  The crowning wrought iron fence is mostly intact, with only a few tines bent and twisted out of alignment with the rest.  Along the ground at the base of the barrier, a thin veil of fog has begun to gather, and it makes its way along in sinuous lines that sway and waver with even the slightest stirring."
