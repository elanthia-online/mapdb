      "Waves slap against nearby tie pilings, the salty spray turning to a drenching mist that causes the floorboards of the pier to glisten in the ambient light.  Bright white numbers are painted within dark blue diamonds, each positioned in front of a different piling and ranging from 16 to 20.  A section of the rope railing that trails the northeastern edge of the pier is torn and frayed, though someone has tied enormous knots at each end to prevent the piece from slipping out of its mooring."
