      "The gigantic longhouses thin toward the northern verges of the village, where an ancient stone henge is comprised of vast standing stones in a rough semicircle.  Granite braziers the size of boulders are positioned along the ring, and their leaping flames envelop the boulders in a dance of dark shadows and golden light.  A path of crushed rock marches toward a breach in the henge."
