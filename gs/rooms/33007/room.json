      "Frosted glass globes hang above a long, marble-topped counter running the length of the far wall.  A tall, spruce-framed mirror is propped up in one corner, its silvered glass reflecting a pair of forgotten ice skates with impossibly knotted laces lying beneath a cushioned bench.  Paper snowflakes cut in fancy patterns cover one wall next to a white silk curtain."
