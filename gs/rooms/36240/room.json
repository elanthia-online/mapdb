      "Small and featuring space for outerwear to be hung up, and muddy footwear to rest, the entry just inside the door has been built in a manner to contain the elements and prevent them from moving further inside.  A pair of black brocaded satin curtains thickly lined with crimson-dyed linen partially blocks the archway leading north into the house.  Above, a vaalin chandelier holds several tall black candles protected with globes of crystal."
