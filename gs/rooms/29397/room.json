      "Centered in the room is a white marble water garden that surrounds a beautifully carved dragonfly with water spouting from its head.  A wide assortment of plants grow in the warm pool, their vibrant blossoms a kaleidoscope of color.  Several braziers are lit about the perimeter, filling the tent with warm, humid air.  A small wooden table is set to the side, its surface covered with a variety of metal wires."
