      "A pair of heavy stone doors is set into the ground at a slight angle, guarding the entrance to a vault or storeroom beneath the castle.  Heavy beams hold the doors shut, secured by thick silver nails.  The path proceeds past the blockaded entrance, passing a spray of dried blood on the wall nearby."
