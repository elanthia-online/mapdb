      "Faded wildflowers and tufts of grass sprout from beneath a bed of pine needles carpeting the secluded garden.  In a circular hollow rests an old stone well, shaded by the overhanging branches of nearby oak and tanik trees.  Aged wooden benches near an arched opening provide weary travelers a spot to relax and meditate."
