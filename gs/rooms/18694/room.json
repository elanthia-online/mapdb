    "description": [
      "A neat, white gravel path lined with rowan trees leads from the wrought iron gate to a circular walk around a large space with a solitary wyrwood tree growing in the center.  A neatly lettered sign has been placed just outside of the tree's reach.  On the far side of the walk is a peak-roofed golden oak lodge.  Unlit oil lamps atop sturdy poles are placed around the compound, and a row of targets waits along the eastern end of the southern wall.  Chips and scorch marks on the brick wall give testimony to frequent practice sessions."
