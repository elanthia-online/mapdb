      "Two huge spotted pale green toadstools growing in a pair of stone pots illuminate the large, comfortable room with a pale tinted light.  A small granite table is centered on a woven sapphire blue carpet with several dark granite benches positioned about it.  Tucked behind one of the potted fungi is a wastebasket carved from solid rock.  On one wall a brass arch allows exit to the corridor outside, while on another a small blackboard hangs next to a wool curtain that leads to the locker area."
