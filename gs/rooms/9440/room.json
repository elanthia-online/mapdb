      "The dull grey granite gives way to redstone as the tunnel widens and descends.  No toadstools light the area, and the way is barely visible.  To the south a timber extends across a wide trench that traverses the floor from wall to wall, while to the north a cavernous opening allows entrance to expansive mine works.  A bit of light filters in from both ends, but hardly enough to do any serious work by."
