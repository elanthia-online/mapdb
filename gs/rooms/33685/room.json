      "Deep blue walls, painted the color of the sea off the coast along River's Rest, have been carefully rendered to make it appear as though one is adrift.  On one side of the room, Fairport's wharf has been carefully rendered in mirror image, giving the illusion you are viewing the city's busy port reflected in the water.  A trio of niches has been built into the remaining walls."
