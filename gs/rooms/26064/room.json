      "Nestled deep below the trunk of the great tree, this extraordinary chamber exudes a tangible sense of living energy.  Enormous, gnarled roots hold back the sooty earth, glowing eerily with sparse pockets of phosphorescent lichen.  Shadowy nooks and crannies disappear between the roots into inky blackness, hinting at unseen secrets.  Intricate arcane runes have been painstakingly etched upon nearly every exposed surface of the chamber."
