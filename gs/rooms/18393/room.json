      "A tall wrought iron railing runs along the edge of the loft.  Some bales of golden hay are arranged in a circle around the middle of the balconied loft.  Glass-paned lanterns hang from the beams overhead and provide a gentle illumination in the loft.  At the back wall, a tanik plank ladder leads back down into the tavern."
