      "Layers of algae and shaleflare moss cover the ground and rocks, making for soft footing and comfortable surfaces to rest upon.  A small cluster of lunebloom coralweed grows out of the grotto walls.  Groups of tideblossom anemones cling to the ceiling rock, providing shifting radiance in cool hues."
