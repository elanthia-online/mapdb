      "The somber entranceway is poorly lit, leaving large shadows to consume the room corners.  A far wall is lined with boots and sandals, probably left by worshippers paying proper respect to the temple.  Small pegs are provided for visitors to leave their cloaks at the door.  You snatch a quick glimpse of a monk in a dark gray robe scurrying into the main temple."
