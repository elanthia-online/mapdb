      "Shutters on the whorled glass windows keep exterior light from invading the small space, their sashes bound by wrought iron hooks fitted into tiny rings.  Covered in surgical implements, a low table rests at the head of a cushioned cotton and rush pallet filled with herbaceous grass.  A bloodstained cushion slid back against one wall is close enough to the pallet to observe anyone there but distant enough to offer a modicum of privacy."
