    "description": [
      "Joined to larger terraces by a pair of crude stone bridges, the parapet is bathed in ethereal light by the pillar of crystal spouting from its center.  The obelisk is suffused with constellations of multicolored light.  They build slowly in its depths before streaking to the surface and dying away, highlighting the unusual curvature of the monolith's faces, which taper toward a point at the monument's zenith.  Mold creeps along the platform in pulpy tangles, but a circle around the pillar remains clear."
