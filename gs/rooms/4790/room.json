    "description": [
      "The road drops sharply to the north, although travel looks much easier to the west.  Much of the undergrowth is gone, replaced by scoured rock surfaces.  Sugar pines anchor what little soil is left, and they show the stress of malnutrition in their twisted, scraggly trunks and sparse foliage.  Many of the flatter rocks display a reddish-brown discoloration similar in appearance to rust left behind by evaporating water.  Perhaps it is indicative of iron deposits in the area."
