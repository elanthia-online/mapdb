      "Eerie, high-pitched shrieks are carried in on chilled sea breezes from the blackened waters below, their clarity distorted as the vorteces of swirling winds collide with upcurrents of sulfurous steam.  Though the origin of the plaintive cries is impossible to determine, they at least to identify the direction of the steep dropoff toward the rocks below, hidden in the fog enshrouded darkness.",
      "Black-headed frigatebirds circle overhead, gliding by on outstreched wings of enormous size.  Where the updraft from the eastern sea meets the fierce winds coming off the plateau, the turbulent gusts lend an extra touch of treachery to the steep and slippery slope of loose, wet rock."
