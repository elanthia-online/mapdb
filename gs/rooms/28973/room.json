      "Wall sconces decorate two of the four sky blue walls, their polished bronze backings reflecting the light in all directions for a nice, even illumination.  A navy blue rug with an enormous white anchor design is spread across the stone floor, the nearby bookcases, cabinets, and desk placed at an angle so as not to cover the image.  Wandering distractedly about, a bright-eyed young clerk peruses several papers from a standing position, seemingly ignoring the office's only chair."
