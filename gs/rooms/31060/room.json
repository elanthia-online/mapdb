      "A snarling warg head stares down from over the doorway leading into the small shop, watchful eyes taking in the collection of tanning racks and barrels of stinking liquid.  Beyond the crowded foyer is a counter of spruce draped in elk hide.  Wreaths of pine and other woven evergreens hang on the walls amid trophies of the hunt, but the fresh woodsy scents do little to ameliorate the sour odor of the business."
