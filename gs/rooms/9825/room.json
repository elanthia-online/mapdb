      "Thick, smooth roots grow along the walls, their dark forms illuminated by the tiny colonies of luminescent fungi growing upon them.  A light fog creeps across the floor, brought on by the heavy chill hanging over the area.  A few yellowed bones have been staked into the ground, the curling mists rising up to caress each of the macabre artifacts."
