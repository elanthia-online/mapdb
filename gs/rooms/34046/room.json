    "description": [
      "Richly inlaid with cerulean glaes and braided spirals of gold, a dark bridge arcs out over a fathomless black chasm toward a crystalline dais at the cavern's center.  Hoarbeam railings guard the crossing to either side, and verdant garlands of bright blue iceblossoms and fiery red holly berries wind along the metallic barriers.  Overhead, chandeliers of blue glaes wink with a thousand lights, scattering a constellation of sparkles across the cavern's lofty ceiling."
