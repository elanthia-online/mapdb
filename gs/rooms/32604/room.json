      "A slender wooden post rises amidst some flowerbeds, hoisting a banner depicting an emblem of a red lion, its cloth crisp and wrinkle free.  Multi-colored canopies decorate the edges of the road, each boutique boasting different goods to sell.  Inside each tent, merchants peddle their wares, a mixture of boisterous exchanges echoing throughout the street.  The mixed aroma of smoked meats drifts out from the open window of a nearby brick-lined shop."
