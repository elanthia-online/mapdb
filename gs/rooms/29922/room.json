      "A wide pathway of packed river stones branches eastward off of the road.  Despite the scope of the path, which is easily wide enough for several wagons to travel side by side, it looks primitive and unimpressive next to the precise march of the road it crosses.  Needles of spruce and pine carpet the east-bearing way, not providing it the apparent deference they show the stark white stones."
