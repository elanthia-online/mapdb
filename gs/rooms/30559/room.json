      "A number of long wooden tables occupy this small walled compound.  Stunted cacti grow in tiny earthen pots on several of the tables, and various instruments of horticulture lie scattered about the compound.  Bottles, powdered herbs, beakers, and mixing instruments reside on most of the tables, with piles of unused containers occupying the compound's four corners just below unlit torches.  There seems to be an elusive feeling of order in the disarray."
