      "The olive trees here are clearly the oldest and wildest in the grove, growing to a height of nearly 50 feet.  Lanterns hang from the lower limbs of the tall trees and the pathway is illuminated by low braziers. The smell of ripening olives drifts through the air.  A few stucco buildings scattered among the trees are visible in the moonlight.",
      "The olive trees here are clearly the oldest and wildest in the grove, growing to a height of nearly 50 feet.  Brightly colored banners and ribbons hang from the trees, rippling in the breeze like the tails of exotic birds.  The smell of ripening olives drifts through the air.  A few pastel-colored stucco buildings are scattered among the trees."
