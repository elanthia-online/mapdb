      "Windows of stained glass gleam in the sunlight, casting jewel-bright shards of radiance on the dusty tables flanking the common room.  The light illuminates a capacious central bar, behind which kegs of ale have been left to go stale and sour.  An ebony carving hangs above the bar, depicting a raven purchase on the shoulders of a ram."
