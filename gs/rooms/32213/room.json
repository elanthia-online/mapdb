      "Fleshy vines pour in from the entrance of the mausoleum and creep across the surface of the granite structure.  From just outside, the faint glow of the crimson flames barely illuminates the interior, causing shadows to flicker across the far wall.  Several coffins, each in front of a chute, used to store cadavers line the eastern and western walls, while the northern wall houses a belt and pulley system for coffin returns."
