      "Beyond a dense screen of thuja and cypress, pale stone tiles spread beneath the shifting canopy, their surfaces worn smooth by time.  Heavy branches cast moving patterns of light and shadow, enclosing the space in quiet seclusion.  A roasting spit stands over a sunken firepit, its iron frame blackened by years of steady flame.  Along the edges, stone benches rest beneath the sheltering trees.  To the north, an arch thick with bougainvillea spills magenta and orange blossoms, leading to another patio."
