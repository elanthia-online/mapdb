      "Carved stone blocks twine sinuously back and forth in every direction, creating a low-lying labyrinth of sorts.  Along the bottom of an overhanging dais on the north side, rune-incised pillars dangle like stalactites above a collection of fresh fish impaled upon a spear.  The blue-green water of the lagoon below is marred by a spiral of red-tinged debris.",
      "Raised, carved stone twists sinuously back and forth in every direction.  Pillars carved with runes are visible beneath a portion of the platforms, and a collection of mostly fresh fish impaled on a spear sits on the floor."
