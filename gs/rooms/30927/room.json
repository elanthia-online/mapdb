      "The office is rather Spartan in design, its chief ornamentation being the lustrous polished finish of the wooden walls.  A single teak desk sits in the center, and one bank of bookshelves stretches around a section of wall at waist level.  Windows on all sides give an expansive view of the jungle canopy, the panorama more vibrant than any painting could be."
