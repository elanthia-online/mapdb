      "The pebbly sand here runs right into the northern wall.  The mural continues where the ground stops, climbing up to an ominous and cavernous outcropping that looks remarkably similar to a giant dark skull.  Two giant palm trees dominate this part of the island, their fronds reaching towards the faux sky."
