      "This octagonal room appears to be some sort of council chamber, for centered within it is a large, circular table cut from red marble and surrounded by eight obsidian chairs.  The floor and walls, also of obsidian, are polished to a high sheen, and inlaid in the floor is a silver eight-pointed star.  A staircase, cut into the stone at the perimeter of the room, spirals out of sight to the floors above and below you."
