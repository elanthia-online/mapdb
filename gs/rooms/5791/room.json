      "Luminous insects rise in clouds from a pit to your west, the living motes of light drifting in the air as if in an unseen tide.  Their feeble light glints off of the clusters of crystal formations along the cavern's walls, an eerily beautiful effect quite at odds with the charnel reek of the nearby pit.  A low stone wall surrounds the fissure."
