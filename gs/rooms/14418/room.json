      "Five tapestries surround the small alcove, each depicting some of Elanthia's most notorious tyrants.  Behind them, crimson walls appear almost blood-like in hue, owing to the dim light afforded by a single iron oil lamp mounted on a central pedestal.  Ebonwood benches rest in front of each woven horror, offering a place for people to sit and contemplate the grandeur of each image."
