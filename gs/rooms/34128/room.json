      "Lacking grass and snow, strips of land have been cleared off and marked out with huge stones, forming wide paths that lead to barren patches of ground enclosed with stones in round patterns.  At the heart of the circle, a huge 'X' has been painted in white paint.  Beneath the canvas are multiple wooden stands housing hammers with an assortment of different handles."
