      "Fingers of lamp light reach in from the tunnel to the northwest, a welcome sight in the dimness of the lower tunnels.  The remains of a lamp dangle down, a wreckage of metal and shards of glass.  The rest of the glass, however, has long since been ground into the floor, giving the dirt a sparkling quality."
