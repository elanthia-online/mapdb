      "The cart strides the boundary between ramshackle and well-used, its paint flaking in the salt air and the exposed wood silvered by exposure to long years in the sun.  Shelves anchored to its outer wall are packed with books, from moldering old tomes to fresh volumes bound in newly polished leather.  Painted narwhals cavort and joust with spiraled horns just above the wheel wells."
