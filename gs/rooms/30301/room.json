      "Sunlight slips through loose canvas draped across the four braced trunks of felled yucca that form the outline of the roof.  Magenta, lavender, and silver hues blend in a mosaic of colors behind a weathered jewelry case and the ironwood bins tucked underneath.  A thin layer of sand swirls along the floor, leading past a rattan bamboo table with a handwritten sign perched next to the wares.",
      "Arid desert air blows through the seams of the canvas draped across the roof of the pavilion.  Flickering in the wind, small lanterns illuminate the muted shades of the colored walls.  Tucked under a weathered jewelry case, the ironwood bins offer embellishments for a variety of shoes.  A thick layer of sand rests atop the floor, marred only by faint footprints leading to a rattan bamboo table that holds a a handwritten sign."
