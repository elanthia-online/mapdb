      "The statue of an elven man with flowing hair and a warrior's muscles towers over the rest of the antechamber, nearly scraping the domed ceiling above.  His face and figure are repeated in friezes occupying alcoves on the walls, although in them he is bathed a startling crimson.  In one of his hands, he clasps a serpent of violet stone.  Floor tiles of the same hue spiral sinuously outward from the statue's pedestal.  To the north is a tall archway curtained with billows of blood red velvet."
