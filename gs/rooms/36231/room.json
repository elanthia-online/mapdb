      "Along the northern wall, a large mithril gate stands between an iron-banded door and a steel-banded door, while a pile of wooden crates line the western wall.  Fresh blood splatter drips down the stone walls, forming dark red pools upon the ground.  Within the center of the room, a granite staircase leads further underground."
