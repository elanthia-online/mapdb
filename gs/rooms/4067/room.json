      "The path ends where the south wall of the town meets the river, extending west in a narrow trail against the wall and upstream into a cluster of riverfront shacks.  Piles of flotsam and jetsam left by the river lie in mounds against the end of the wall where it extends into the water, and several filthy children and dogs rummage among the debris, searching for treasures left by the current."
