      "Pale amethyst silk draped from a study birch frame fashions the walls of the spacious shop.  Scattered along the edge, a series of spiraled vaalin racks contain a wide variety of wares for inspection.  In between the displays, lanterns hang from twisted silver stands, illuminating a bronze-edged mistwood chest and an etched crystal sign suspended from the rafters above.  A silk-curtained archway leads deeper into the shop."
