      "Winding down from the castle's high hilltop, a pale stone bridge stretches, long and serpentine, over a treacherous ravine.  Spread-winged grotesques stand on parapets along the bridge, guarding its length.  The bridge is carved from exquisite white stone aglitter with countless flecks of prismatic mica."
