      "Sand and stone meet in a clash of blacks and greys, the volcanic grit darker by several shades than the sharp bits of shale that have tumbled down the incline to the east.  Though whipped by winds wailing off of the Frostmain's frigid waters, the area is graced by patches of scraggly vegetation, mostly tenacious weeds that have found purchase in crags and furrows in the earth."
