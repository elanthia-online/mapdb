      "Heavy wooden planks enclose the area, the walls dominated by long feeding troughs filled with wild grasses, weeds, and various bits of flora.  A pair of oversized boulders dominates the center of the room, the rocks covered in layers of dark green moss that spreads to the straw-covered ground below."
