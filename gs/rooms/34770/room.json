      "Torchlight flickers to the southwest, but the span of the eastern chamber labors under the heavy press of shadow.  Rearing up out of a nest of blackness darker than pitch, an immense spider statue hewn from oily black stone dominates the eastern quadrant of the shrine.  Its carapace is swollen and huge, and a pair of serrated razern fangs curve down from its jaw, each tinged a darker hue by bile-green fluid staining its surface."
