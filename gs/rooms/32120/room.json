      "Two slick granite boulders force a slow-moving stream to divert away from a patchwork moldy fishing dock, zigzagging until it double backs on the southern side.  Nearly destroyed, the dock is now infested with the dimly glowing, multihued mold that pervades the area and intensifies to the southwest.  Gnarled, petrified trees twist upwards, covered in patches of blues, red, greens, and yellows.  A tumbledown moldy gangway leads away from the dock."
