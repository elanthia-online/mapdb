      "Near the zenith of the bridge, a black covered coach stands abandoned, the leads cut and one of its wheels badly bent.  The vehicle's windows are shattered, and the doors are savaged with claw marks.  One of the coach's doors is open toward the bridge's safety wall, where a pile of moldy luggage lies."
