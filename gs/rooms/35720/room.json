    "description": [
      "A sheltered alcove nestled within the branches of a blossoming meranti houses a hut secured to the tree's trunk by old ship timbers.  From its hide-covered windows beckons a strange perfume that is a not-unpleasant mixture of dried herbs and the musk of burning incense.  Tiny runes are scratched into strips of pounded bark parchment hanging from the eaves, though a few have fallen and litter the platform before it amid white-petaled meranti blossoms."
