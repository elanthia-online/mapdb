      "Nestled against the blue-grey slate of the southern wall, cultivated cordias rise from the feathery marram grass.  Soft grey planks, worn smooth from wind and age, form a curving boardwalk that spans the tall grass that grows at the edge of a mica-flecked white beach.  Shell and pebble-lined walkways connect a series of small domiciles to the boardwalk, while a sinuous sandy path cuts through the dunes towards the sound of crashing waves."
