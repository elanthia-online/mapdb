      "The suite spans the width of the mid-level deck, situated at the fore of the riverboat with large floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the main deck below.  Hammered gold runners hold elegant rugs atop ebon marble floors, and ornately carved cherrywood walls reflect the lustrous glow of the sun.  A few steps down into a sunken room lead to an immense, richly curtained bed piled high with luxurious bedding."
