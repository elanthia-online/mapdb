      "A wide and colorful banner proclaims, \"~Get Your Souvenirs Here~\" from its prominent spot along the back wall.  To one side is a souvenir-filled bookcase, complete with a line of stuffed blue bunnies perched along the base and positioned to stare up at the showcased goods.  In the middle of the space rests an elongated carved maple toychest, its lid flung open to better display its contents."
