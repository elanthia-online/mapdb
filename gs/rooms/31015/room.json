      "Buzzing with activity, this huge room houses a few tall tables surrounded by workers engaged in various activities.  Clusters of frosted globes above each provide bright light for the detailed leather work being done.  Around the darkened walls, shelves are stocked with numerous supplies.  Leather scraps litter the stone floor around woven mats for the workers to stand on.  A lone marble workbench has been positioned in a way to greet an arch in the east wall while overseeing the entire operation."
