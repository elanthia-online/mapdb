      "Polished wood panels frame the compact kiosk, its countertop lined with shallow trays of neatly arranged gemstones.  Rows of smooth cabochons gleam beneath the open-air light, their glassy surfaces reflecting hues of deep sapphire, emerald, and amber.  Small compartments hold faceted stones, each catching a different glint as they shift within their cases.  A narrow awning extends overhead, shading the display while ribbons tied to the corners sway lightly with the passing air."
