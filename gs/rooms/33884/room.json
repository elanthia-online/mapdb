      "A verdant grove of olive and citrus trees frame the terraced lawn of the gardens, the graduated layers of greenery sprinkled with fringed maedatha blankets set between glazed clay pots.  An arched ebony-planked bridge stands further across the lawn, crossing the crystalline waters beneath a latticework of wide silk ribbons, the dozens of tiny polychromatic faerthiel glinting in the ambient light.  Subtly nestled between the arboreal forms is a diminutive pool, the moss-covered stones adorned with small tokens."
