      "Yellowish green tassels dangle from the corners of steel blue cushions, which are scattered upon the travertine floor in a haphazard fashion around a low round table.  Painted screens separate the western edges of the space from the rest of the pavilion, their bright white faces painted with blue eryngium, while the gradient blue walls keep the exterior at bay."
