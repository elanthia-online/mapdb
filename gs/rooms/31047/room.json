      "Brightly colored posters and fanciful sketches decorate the white stucco walls of the small baker's shop.  Clustered globes of light spill their bright illumination everywhere, while stainless steel tables form a barrier between customers and the many ovens that line the back wall.  Filled with a variety of decorated cakes, a glass-front display case displays the various offerings of the bakery."
