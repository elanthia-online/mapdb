      "Lengths of twine are strung between oaken tent poles creating clotheslines, each hung with a variety of woolen garments.  Pushed up against the tent walls, several mismatched wooden trunks sit open with the contents in complete disarray.  Above a tattered tent flap, the severed head of a massive grey wolf is mounted, its sizable jaws propped open in a perpetually menacing growl."
