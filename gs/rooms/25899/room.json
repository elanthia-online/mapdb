      "A current of warm air flows from the walkway that winds south beneath an arched canopy of trees.  As it mixes with the frosty air, a constant breeze swirls through the area.  A narrow flagstone path splits as it leads to both a tile-roofed manor house and a thatch-roofed cobblestone cottage.",
