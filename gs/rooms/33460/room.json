      "Alternating tiles of white, black, and light grey create intriguing floor patterns that have been mimicked with paint to a halfway point on the walls where they meet a solid travertine border of dark grey.  Woven baskets overflowing with white jasmine hang strategically throughout the shop and infuse their sweet fragrance into the ocean-scented air.  Working ardently behind a light grey travertine counter, a brown-haired designer pauses briefly to greet each customer that enters the shop."
