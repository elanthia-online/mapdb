      "A single, giant, petrified redwood stands amongst lesser pines and firs.  A deep black, onyx tablet displaying an eight-pointed star of pure silver is firmly imbedded in the tree, and a row of small stones, carefully placed end-to-end, encircles the tree.  A large bouquet of trumpet flowers and the carcass of a woodchuck have been laid at the tree's base.  Interestingly, both offerings seem to be fresh."
