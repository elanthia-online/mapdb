      "The path descends into a depression here, dipping below the surface of the swamp for a short stretch.  Roots of trees and bushes can be felt underfoot but cannot be seen while moving through the murky waters.  Nearby trees have begun to lean inward toward the path, perhaps on the way to a collapse caused by erosion."
