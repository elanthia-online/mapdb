    "description": [
      "A dirt-strewn workbench lines one entire wall of this shack, with gardening implements neatly arranged on a pegboard mounted just above.  Clay pots in mostly neat stacks sit over in one corner, while a worn leather-covered stool is posted by a gated entry to an utterly uncurated garden behind the shack.  Across from the workbench is a neatly kept rack of small bottles and vials filled with a variety of substances, from dried herbs and lichen to luminous liquids of unknown origin."
