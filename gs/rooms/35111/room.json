      "Seaglass in a hodgepodge of bright colors has been used as tesserae in the face of a stone shrine set back from the road.  The smell of burning seaweed emanates from within, carried on clouds of light grey smoke that puff from the building's chimney.  Sailors frequent the monument, draping offerings over the tines of a carved driftwood trident hanging over the entrance or leaving them in a stone bowl nearby."
