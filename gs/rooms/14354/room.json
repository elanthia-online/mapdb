      "Polished linden floors are covered with thick woven rugs displaying archaic battles of an arcane nature.  Floor to ceiling cases lined with books cover the cylindrical room and hide the walls that support the tiled ceiling.  A small round table rests at the heart of the room, hiding the opponent in the flooring's battle scene, flanked by crushed black velvet settees."
