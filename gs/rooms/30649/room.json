      "Marble counters stretch along two walls, copper cooking utensils littering their surfaces.  Beneath the counters a large circular shelf slowly turns, hiding then revealing an assortment of spice-filled jars, bags of food staples, and canned preserves.  Just above a large basin, rosewood cupboards with etched glass panels display various styles of dinnerware."
