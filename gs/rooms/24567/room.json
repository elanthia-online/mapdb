      "Shades of sea green and soft white envelop this capacious hall.  Two outstretched chandeliers hang from the ceiling, their upswept arms decked in faceted crystals that cast a multitude of tiny reflections across the room.  Tall, narrow windows draped in gossamer are spaced evenly along the walls and accented by pale gold sconces.  A highly polished teakwood floor beckons dancers, while sofas and chairs covered in crushed velvet surround the dance floor."
