      "Numerous ferns of varying sizes and shades of green grow along the edges of an expansive open area, their lush verdancy almost obscuring ghostly white orchids and vibrant red mushrooms.  A few carts and tents are scattered along the perimeter, felled trees pulled around firepits, and a faint path cuts through and disappears into the jungle beyond."
