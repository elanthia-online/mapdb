      "A cracked ceremonial mask hangs on one of the tightly-woven beige canvas walls, and a swirl-painted white stucco ceiling rises overhead.  A dusky blue cotton rug sits in one corner of a white limestone floor.  There is a white marble shelf on one side of the shop and a Vornavian silk-lined display case on the other."
