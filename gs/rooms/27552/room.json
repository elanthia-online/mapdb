    "description": [
      "Vines drape from the high granite wall that disappears into the sky, the stone's dark face and towering height looming ominously over the small village.  Cracked barrels, discarded wagon wheels, and piles of warped boards lie broken upon the ground and display signs of long exposure to water and other elements.  Cracked coral, dried-out seaweed, and tangles of kelp rest in huge piles throughout the area, the strange aquatic flora looking out of place in the jungle-like foliage.",
      "Blooming vines drape from the high granite wall, the stone's towering height providing a modicum of respite for a group of villagers engaged in lively conversation.  Baskets of fresh vegetables sit snuggled between the rows of a garden, the produce receiving a surprise inspection by a pair of curious kittens weaving in between the containers.  A pair of tridents, held together with pieces of sinew-bound driftwood, solemnly stand guard along the village edge, each one strung with bits of tumbled sea glass."
