      "Tucked in the nooks and crevices of a collapsed cavern wall that skirts the ascending rocky heights, spiny lichens dress the woodsy ground before a tapered path in hints of subtle yellow, grey-violet, and frosty emerald.  In an astonishing feat of artistry, the flexuous branches of aged ironwood trees are trained into a colossal interlocking archway of latticed knotwork."
