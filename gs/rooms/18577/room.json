      "Originally a storeroom, this small shop expansion still smells of newly cut wood.  Counters have been improvised from long, wide wooden planks set atop empty barrels, and raw, unstained shelving occupies one wall.  Metal racks display wares on two additional walls, with uncrated merchandise stacked below."
