      "Behind a gilded scissor gate, a lift operator stands at the ready, one hand on a polished brass lever clearly marked with the floors of the hotel.  The walls are covered with burnished cherrywood and silvered glass which reflects a cushioned bench covered in plush crimson velvet at the rear of the lift.  A low thrum emanates from behind the paneling."
