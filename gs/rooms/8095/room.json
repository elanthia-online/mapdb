      "A sturdy smithy stands to the north, acrid smoke wafting from its chimney.  The door leading into the smithy is split, the upper part usually open to let heat inside escape.  A few farm tools, damaged and speckled with rust, lean against the smithy.  A large, but simple, house stands to the south."
