      "Sandy-hued, high pile carpeting covers the floor from one wall to the other, its weft and weave bestowing the likeness of a water-darkened beach beneath an azure sky ceiling.  Two hammocks woven from thick braids of linen and raw silk hang catercornered against the far wall, lashed to metal fixtures mounted on opposing sides of each wall joint.  Between them is a forked driftwood stand beneath an oval mirror with a lithe siren-cast bronze frame, and a painted mural adorns the walls from the head of each hammock to the door."
