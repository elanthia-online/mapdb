      "Squeezed between tightly crowded homes, shops, and anonymous buildings, the narrow track connects Comyner's Court to Drayhyme Way.  Shadows lay heavy upon the alley, whispers lingering in the air despite no visible citizens wandering nearby.  The chittering of rats, coming from somewhere down a side passage between buildings, echoes on the cobblestones."
