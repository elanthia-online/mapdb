      "Bouncing with unbridled motion, this fragile link between the west ledge and north ledge quickly becomes a lifebuoy, evidenced by the haggard condition of the once-thick ropes that serve as railings.  An echoing drip-drop sound serves only to distract from the inability to see clearly in this mist-laden area of the cavern.  Slick walls glisten despite sufficient lighting, mostly due to silvery blue flecks imbedded into the stone."
