      "Only the sides of the polished white marble floor are visible beneath the plush, powder blue runner that runs the length of the corridor.  Identical brass flowerpots stand opposite each other filled to the brim with trumpet-shaped purple blossoms of mournblooms.  Every so often, melancholy sounds, like the sad song of a lone woman, emanates from somewhere nearby."
