      "The gallery comes to an end beneath a gilded arch that is gratuitously decorated with bramble carvings.  Alone on the wall beneath it is an ebony-framed portrait that depicts a proud, pale man holding a goblet of wine aloft.  Censers of thick, sweet smoke hang from the ceiling near the picture on steel chains, making it look more of a shrine than an art display."
