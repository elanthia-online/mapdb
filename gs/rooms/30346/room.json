    "description": [
      "Stylized flames of burnished teak are inlaid into the decking of the forecastle, the walls covered in layers of fur to shield from the winter winds.  Spindled railings are fitted with copper lanterns, the bright red windows within reflecting the ambient light.  Providing an excellent viewing point from which to admire the length of the boat, the forecastle's view is unobstructed as the sky blue sails of both the fore and aftmast are fully furled."
