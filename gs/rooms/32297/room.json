      "Rolls of painted backdrops hang from the ceiling, suspended by chains from sturdy oaken rods.  Airy windows stand on either side of a wood-framed dark slate chalkboard, laid open to catch the breeze, while tilted tables on casters and neatly spaced wooden easels encircle a plush plum divan in the center.  The wooden floor is splotched with a plethora of paint in every shade and hue, creating a mosaic of its own.  Slat-doored shelves line the periphery and the studio's rear wall is plastered with drawings between a marquetry faewood door and a gated passageway terminating in a spiral staircase."
