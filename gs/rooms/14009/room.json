      "Silver and crystal girandoles reflect the flickering flames of hundreds of beeswax candles.  On the floor in front of a plain altar, several crewelwork prayer rugs invite deep meditation.  Antique alms boxes and collection plates fill a tall etagere.  Covered in soft white velvet, a circle of oversized pillows are piled onto a fine black sable rug.  Affixed to the wall above a brushed silver table is a white vultite sign."
