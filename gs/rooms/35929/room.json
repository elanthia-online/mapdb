      "The dense forest runs right up to the edge of a dark-faced pond, crowding thickly along the narrow strip of shore that runs between the trees and the water.  Rocks and debris litter the bank as it trails like a dark ribbon off into the darkness and fog in the distance, while closer at hand sits a bench fashioned of a split tree trunk, slightly back from the water's edge, and newly budding wisp lanterns luminesce softly about its legs."
