      "Travertine pavers, surrounded by brightly colored, elfin creeping thyme, decorate the promenade, which hugs the cliff side and gently slopes downward away from some curved marble steps that lead to the avenue above.  Cypress trees dot the edges amid railings that offer a view of the ocean, while several shops stand opposite one another with open and inviting doorways.  A carved marble bench provides a quiet place for respite.",
