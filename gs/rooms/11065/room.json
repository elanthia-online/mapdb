      "The stairs continue, carved out of the sandstone that makes up one wall of this chamber.  A small landing is present here, as it appears that the original carvers had to pick up the vein of sandstone on the other side of the chamber.  A chimney and ladder have been carved from the sandstone vein and a roaring noise can be heard from below as a steady cloud of mist rises up the chimney."
