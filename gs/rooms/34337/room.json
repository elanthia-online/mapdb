      "At the top of a steep scree declivity, unstable rock gives way to immovable stone.  What was a steep climb now becomes a vertical one.  Mercifully, disguised within the shadow of a tall outcropping, some crude steps have been carved into the mountain.  They zig and zag as they lead the way up, moving closer to falls as they rise, until finally reaching the east bank of the waterfall's crest."
