      "The canopy overhead is thick in this area with massive tree trunks dotting the space but not much in the way of underbrush.  Straw has been laid out across the ground to prevent mud from forming in the humid conditions, and a series of elaborately carved wooden benches are interspersed in no discernible pattern.  It is quiet here, with a distinctly settled, peaceful ambience amongst the towering trees."
