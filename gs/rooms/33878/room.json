      "Gently curved lamp posts of dark faenor flank the slate-roofed pale limestone stables at the turn of the cobblestone walkway, the spherical lanterns draping tendrils of heartleaf in lacelike patterns.  A trio of leather-wrapped racks are affixed to the side of the narrow steps further into the harbor, the wooden lengths draped with reins and leather saddles embroidered in floral arabesques.  Set between a duo of iron-legged stools is a half-barrel trough, the vessel overflowing with wildflowers."
