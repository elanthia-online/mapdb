    "description": [
      "The walls of the room are covered in a collection of parchment-winged butterflies, the insects dyed in various shades of lavender and mint.  The workshop is situated with a glowing brazier, providing warmth to the room, alongside the thick snowy pelts lining the floor.  Across from the brazier is an ora-banded barrel set next to a sturdy oak worktable, the working area complete with tool rack hung above for easy access.  Wood paneling frames the doorway, accenting the overall design of the room."
