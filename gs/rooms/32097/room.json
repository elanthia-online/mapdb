      "Void of any color other than black, it is hard to tell how big or small this room is as the walls blend with the floor and ceiling, blurring the edges of where one ends and the other begins.  There is only a white rocking chair placed against the back of the room and the door you entered through.  The chair looks large enough to seat two people and has a one-eyed stuffed bear sitting in it."
