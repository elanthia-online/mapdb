      "Soft pools of light emanate from the tinted globes of oil lamps and reflect off the polished surfaces of matching end tables that flank the bed, enhancing the cozy atmosphere of the bedchamber.  Shimmering yellow netting drapes elegantly from the top of the canopy bed and is tied back with a blood red, braided cord to display the crimson heart-embroidered coverlet.  Blood red carpeting patterned with hearts in gold spreads from wall to wall.  Piles of tasseled pillows are placed near the fireplace."
