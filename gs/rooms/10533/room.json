      "Smoke rises in thick, choking vines from the depth of a hollow cavity in the ground.  A stench like that of sulfur and burning flesh punishes the air.  A narrow thread of land spirals downward into the pit.  Huge shiny pieces of ore are embedded into its walls and are illuminated by a particularly bright moonbeam.  The ground surrounding the pit is dry and sandy and completely devoid of life.",
