      "A brightly burning fireplace has labored to fill the close air of the shop with warmth, but only enough smoke to blacken the low eaves.  Several rabbit statuettes made from fired clay sit atop an old wooden counter that marks the boundaries of a tidy office space.  On a desk behind the counter, several crystal leaves are pieced together to form an incomplete clover talisman."
