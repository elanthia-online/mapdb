      "A rickety watch tower looks out over the northern curve of the palisade wall as it disappears into the surrounding woodlands.  Built of old wood and possessed of a decided lean, the construction looks to have seen better days.  With feet firmly dug into the hardpack, a rough-hewn spruce ladder ascends to the nest at the top of the guard post."
