      "Rippling in the arctic breezes, the walls of the pavilion flutter and sway at sporadic moments.  Nearby, a central post keeps the ceiling aloft and allows for a view of the entire tent, though passage to its other areas is confined by the position of hay bales covered in fabric.  A low wooden table stretches across the alley between the bales."
