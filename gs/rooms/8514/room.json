    "description": [
      "In the center of the circle of trees stands what once was a giant among trees.  It is long dead, but it seems not to have died a quiet death.  Its twisted, black stumps of branches writhe and sway in the wind as though the very spirit of the tree itself were still rooted to this spot in eternal torment."
