      "A cracked ceremonial mask hangs on one of the plain wooden walls, and an uneven wooden ceiling rises overhead.  An open-mawed greater vruul statue sits in one corner of a varnished dark oak floor.  There is a brass treasure chest on one side of the shop and a cedar and oak footlocker on the other."
