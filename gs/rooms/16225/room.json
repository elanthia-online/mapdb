      "The lane turns back on itself, creating a small enclosed court crowded with buildings.  Heat bakes the paving stones, lifting from them in a shimmering haze.  At the apex of the turn, a set of tall, wrought-iron gates guard the entrance to a stately residence.  Tall lebbek trees growing on either side of the gate throw a bit of welcome shade in that corner of the avenue."
