      "The river bends sharply here between steep, tree-lined banks, the roots of the willow and alder sentinels bursting out of the damp earth and reaching towards the dark waters.  Visibility is low as a somber mist shrouds the bend making it almost impossible to see what lies ahead, though the sound of lapping water denotes that the shore is nearby."
