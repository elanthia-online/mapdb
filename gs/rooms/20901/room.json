      "Winding and steep, the trail moves from the jungle floor towards a ridge of gnarl-limbed zebrawood trees.  Bamboo and wire fencing is used to hold back the multiple tangles of tropical vines that threaten to clog the walking area.  At the bend, a cluster of rocks has been piled in an odd arrangement.  Tucked back behind a thick stand of trees is a moss-covered stone keep.",
