    "description": [
      "Smooth-worn floorboards spread throughout the crowded bar, cut from the same warped oak as the long wooden bartop sitting off to the side near the door.  A stool or three sit in front of the bar, their cushions tattered and water-stained but otherwise serviceable.  Underneath a huge bronze boar's head sprouting from the wall above the bar, a faded sign lists the establishment's offerings."
