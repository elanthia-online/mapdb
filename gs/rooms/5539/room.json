      "Devoid of the door that once filled it, a modwir-framed doorway in the east wall lets out onto a small tiled courtyard.  A pile of refuse lies in the room's southwest corner, partially obscuring the outline of a trapdoor set into the floor, but otherwise the room is bare.  A tanik door leads to the corridor at the west end of the room."
