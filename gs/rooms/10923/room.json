      "A cobblestone thoroughfare winds through rows of houses flanked by brightly colored tents, and venders selling all manner of wares from the backs of wagons.  Against the side of one house, a basket seller has set up shop.  The well-made merchandise sits beneath a red and white striped awning, different sized containers stacked one on top the other."
