    "description": [
      "Dust hangs heavily in the air, lending it a musty scent tinged with ash.  The western end of the tunnel terminates in a rough rockface, while more smoothly hewn stone walls extend away from it in the opposite direction.  Inset into the ceiling is a wooden trapdoor with no visible means of opening."
