      "A cluster of glowing glimaerstones is set into the paneled wooden ceiling, encased in a globe of rainbow glaes.  They suffuse the nexus of two hallways with multihued light that awakens many hues in the grey planking of the deck.  A painted crimson door breaches one wall, standing opposite a painting of a slumbering seaside town."
