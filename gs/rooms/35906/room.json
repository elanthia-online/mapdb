      "The immensity of the valley below erupts within the darkened, lunate cradle of the opposite rise in a riot of fiery hues.  Cushion-plump crowns of scarlet, yellow-gold, and tangerine top the trees, the ground beneath their plumed limbs hidden entirely by the display.  A low-lying fog haunts the perimeter of the wood, while the heart of the grove seems to glow with a light born of the myriad leaves."
