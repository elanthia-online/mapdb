      "Standing in front of a beautifully carved chair, a huge silver mistwood harp dominates the small room.  Several piles of manuscripts and sheet music are stacked about the deep crimson rug.  A tall silver stand of candles sits to the side of the large arcing window, a small writing desk to the other."
