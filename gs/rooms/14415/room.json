      "Three paths lined in white gravel that gleams with bits of crushed shell lead to the north, west and east.  The zoo's front entrance can be glimpsed through a massive stone arch.  An enormous circular planter sits in the center of the crossroads.  Cleverly built into the edge of the planter, wooden benches offer a pleasant place to sit and enjoy the colorful blooms.",
