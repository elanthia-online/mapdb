      "Paint splatters the walls, ceiling, and floors of the small shop, though surprisingly leaves the furnishings untouched.  Picture frames decorate the splattered walls, each supporting blank canvases that are almost too bright for the space.  Lanterns hang over a long wooden counter where wrought iron hooks keep various masks on display."
