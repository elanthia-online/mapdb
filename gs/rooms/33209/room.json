      "Defining the circumference of this circular room, eight ornate pillars rise and then curve inward to a single carved boss.  Comfortable chairs and book-laden endtables are loosely clustered around an intricately carved walnut fireplace, above which is set a silver looking-glass.  Near a gracefully curved walnut arch leading back to the inn, a sideboard offers an array of refreshments."
