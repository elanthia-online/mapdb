      "Irregular gaps in the plank walls and ceiling emit shafts of moonlight that form a webwork of shadows on the dirt floor.  A dirty counter, constructed of a warped board stretched between haphazardly stacked rocks, leans precariously against one wall.  Some corroded hooks have been driven into the back wall."
