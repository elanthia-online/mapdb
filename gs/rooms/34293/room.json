      "With barely enough space to take a deep breath, this thin ledge, which continues across the mountain face and hangs on the precipice of tragedy, supports travelers as they precariously shuffle from one side to the other.  An up close and personal view of the mountain face shows unnoticed or perhaps forgotten details about the aged granite.  The trail appears safely reachable with a fairly effortless leap, but the trek to the south appears a bit more grueling, especially given the weather conditions."
