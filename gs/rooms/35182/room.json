      "Large glass tanks, filled with a glowing virid liquid, are arranged along a continuous, curved stone wall that encloses this crudely carved-out space under the streets of Bloodriven Village.  Glyph-etched crystals adorn a variety of armors displayed on some pitted green metal busts in the center of this oval chamber, surrounded by a haze of virescent fumes that clings to the irregular, muddy floor.  Opposite a pitted metal ladder leading up to an acid-stained black metal hatch at one end of the ellipse, a twisted black metal shelf is haphazardly mounted to the wall."
