      "The vast, glass-walled structure has an open layout with no real division of rooms, except for a study on the eastern side set off by frosted glass walls.  A waist-high, long black marble koi pond lines the west side, and the warm-hued tropical hardwood floor gives way on the east to a recessed square pit bordered with cushions, providing a seating area."
