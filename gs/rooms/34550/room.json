      "Carved from pale birch, a thick pole creates a sharp peak in the canopy of the tent.  Light breezes from outside cause the pale amethyst silk walls of the tent to billow to and fro.  A spiraled silver rack rests to one side of the space, while a lacquered tigerwood stand is displayed along the other."
