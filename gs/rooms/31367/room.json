      "A deep mineral scent pervades the warm cavern cut into the limestone heart of the mountain by natural and artisanal means.  An expansive crystalline hot spring, captured behind a low mortared flagstone wall, is fed by a pair of elegant, carved aqueducts circumscribing the rough stone walls, with two inlaid stone stairways completing their frame around the pool.  A filamentous network of rose quartz veins twists throughout the limestone walls, conveying a warm, ethereal light from the surface into the cavern."
