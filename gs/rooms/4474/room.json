      "[The Plaid Brat]"
    ],
    "description": [
      "This small shop is brilliant with whitewash, liberally applied over carefully plastered walls.  Tea has been laid upon a plaid tablecloth covering a three-legged table.  The table provides an excellent vantage point for perusal of the polished clothes press adjacent to the arch or contemplation of the niche carved into the wall close to the exit.  An assortment of brats and cloaks on the rack in the shop's center also invites a second glance."
