      "Skylights fitted with crystal panes allow the pale moonlight to fill the entryway of the academy.  A multi-hued carpet covers the floor, its dark patterned material creates a sharp contrast to the silvery white stone floor.  While this chamber is obviously a foyer, no exit door can be found, only a small hallway leads out into the rest of the building."
