      "Snow lightly dusts the cobblestone path winding between bare-branched fruit trees and a smattering of fragrant cedars.  Down a twisting pathway are several buildings, small icicles glittering off their eaves.  To the south rests a large lake surrounded by buildings, a trellis of ice-veiled roses arching over the southwesterly path leading to it."
