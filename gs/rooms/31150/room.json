      "Ornamental evergreen shrubs densely pack around the western edge of the trail before descending down a crowded slope towards the forest below.  Spreading beneath the vibrant green foliage are clusters of ivory sedge that are dappled with whitish-green flowers.  A colony of map lichen surrounded by black fungal hyphae spreads across a family of boulders, the green tendrils prolific but never advancing to the windward side."
