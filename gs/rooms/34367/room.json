    "description": [
      "While mostly advantageous, a noticeable increase in distant ambient lighting gives a splash of insight into the claustrophobic quality of these tunnels.  At the juncture of multiple passageways, a strong wind whips through the tunnel and brings with it a myriad of smells and sounds, a subterranean concoction with an unsavory appeal.  With a slight downgrade, the ground becomes increasingly slippery as the moisture levels rise and solid footing turns to mud."
