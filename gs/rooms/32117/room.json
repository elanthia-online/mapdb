    "description": [
      "Twisted mangroves clog the muddy banks on either side of a fungus-laden rotted fishing dock, their clumped masses saturated with faintly glowing viridian moss that dimly illuminates the area.  Branching towards the entangled apex of an uncanny, leafless canopy above, the boughs of ancient and gnarled petrified trees extend high over the dock underfoot.  The waters of the stream move laboriously slow, a flickering shadowy reflection across its surface distorted and jagged.  A rotted wooden gangway leads away from the dock."
