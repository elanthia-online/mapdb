      "A massive oak, its wide girth dominating this small clearing, extends its finger-like branches toward the heavens.  Around its base, a cluster of pale cobblestones has been upturned, as if the roots of the large tree were clawing toward the surface.  The trunk has taken on a light grey hue, as if the tree itself were suffering from some unknown malady.  A thick woven cord, knotted in numerous places, dangles from some branch hidden in the heights of the old tree.",
