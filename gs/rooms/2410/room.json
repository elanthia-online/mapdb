      "Occasional cheers of victory or groans of failure echo from the west, where the rooftop of the town's gaming hall glistens with a fresh tracing of silvery ice.  Several newcomers to town, standing out due to their foreign garb and lack of layered clothing, filter through the doors of a stone cottage.  A few crafty young krolvin linger outside, plying them for spare silvers.",
      "The hoarse voices from the west are hard to understand.  Either they are happy cries or anguished moans, or perhaps both.  A group of enterprising youths approach you and ask for silvers, but continue along the road without pausing for your response."
