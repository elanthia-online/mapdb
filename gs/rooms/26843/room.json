      "A view of the tavern is visible though a rough oak branch railing that lines the edge of the loft, which has several tables and chairs set about the area for the patrons.  A battered dart board hangs from one wall, while flickering oil lanterns hang from pegs, providing some dim and dirty light to the area."
