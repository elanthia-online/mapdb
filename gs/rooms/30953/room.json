      "A small wicker chest is tucked under a large cupboard that stands next to a porcelain sink.  Thyme, basil, and other herbs grow in pots along the deep sill of the multi-paned window above.  A massive cookstove covers the far wall, kettles and pots warming on top.  Dominating the center of the kitchen is a well-used butcher's block piled with utensils, knives and baskets of food ready for preparation.  Shelves of food can be seen through the glass front of a wooden ice chest that is built to one side of a pantry door.",
