      "Piles of coarse hides are stacked almost to the low ceiling in the corners of the chamber.  Crude bone tools, barely visible in the flickering illumination from the entrance, are scattered about the floor.  A niche in the rear wall holds a small statue which has been hewn with barely more skill than the tools surrounding it."
