      "Enclosed on three sides by spires of volcanic rock, this small cove is broken by a number of smaller rocky outcroppings, creating a vast rookery.  A large gathering of cormorants nest on a central rock, their dark heads bobbing shadows.  Smaller birds rest about in various nooks and ledges worn into the cliffs."
