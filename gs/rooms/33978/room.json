      "Moss-covered steps lead up to the raised stone terrace and the doors leading into the manor, while overgrown grass, brambles, and rose bushes make moving across the lawn complicated.  Unkempt, tiny paths lead into a wild garden, whimsical statuary visible here and there, bordered on one side by a giant hedge wall broken only by a gated archway.  A small trail curves around the manor, and a half-circle of stone benches is visible to the west."
