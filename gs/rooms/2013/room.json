      "The trail dead-ends at the edge of a steep crevasse.  At the bottom of the drop, a fast stream cuts its way through the perilous volcanic boulders.  Fed by spray from the white water, dense patches of dark moss coat the rocks near the water.  Hundreds of tiny raised stalks stand up from the green verdure like a miniature forest.  The chorus of an army of frogs rises from the darkness of the chasm.",
