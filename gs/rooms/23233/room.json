      "The light shining through crystalline windows brightens an already cheerfully decorated room.  A comfortable over-stuffed loveseat beckons invitingly from a corner, near a small fireplace against the wall.  A woolly thrak hide rug lies in front of the fireplace and a pair of empty wineglasses stand nearby.  A fine portrait rests upon the mantle."
