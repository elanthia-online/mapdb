      "Traffic steadily moves north, east, and southwest through this tunnel junction.  A small brown door nestles unobtrusively into the west wall next to a wide glass window, and a red door stands along the southern wall.  Dwarves, particularly children, move up to press their noses against the window's glass and stare in at the displays.  Then they either happily enter the shop, or they move along, usually with a sigh and a wistful expression, and go about their business.",
