      "A teak tree rises up into the misty canopy above, its highest branches lost in the tangle of those of the neighboring trees.  Overgrowing the trunk, a layer of vines, reaches all the way down to the forest floor and creeps into the nearby vegetation.  Ferns dot the landscape and the trail is lost for a moment before picking up again to either side.",
