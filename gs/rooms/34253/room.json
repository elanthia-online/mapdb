      "Jagged crystals erupt from the umber stone of the walls, sparking with irregular bursts of sickly radiance.  The light filters through yellow-grey clouds spewing from vents in the rolling rock near the plaza's edge, lending a sulphurous stink to the sharp sourness in the hot air.  Though crudely shaped, the openings are too numerous and too evenly spaced to be purely natural in origin."
