      "Carved from the hillside, the small landing blends into the terrain with tiles of flint and slate.  Colorful wildflowers cling to the steep and rocky ground, contrasting with the darker greys and browns of their surroundings.  Tucked close to the craggy wall is a small pine cottage surrounded by hardy greenery that grows in thick clusters."
