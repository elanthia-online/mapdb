    "description": [
      "With heavily leafed branches encircling their trunks, the massive trees dwelling in this part of the wood are less densely spaced, giving their canopies the room to spread.  The ground below is only dappled with light, mostly shed from the various bioluminescent fungi found at the edges of the narrowing path.  In contrast to the consuming mosses and lichen, a few specimens of gold-cored ruby starflower stand against the bases of the towering trees, as if mere proximity will lend them strength."
