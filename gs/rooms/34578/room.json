      "Small shrubs and bushes line the flagstone path that leads through the courtyard, their blackened leaves and dreadful blooms creating an unnatural privacy wall.  In contrast to the surrounding area, a beautiful marble statue stands surrounded by various delicate flowers of all colors growing about the statue's base, filling the air with a sweet aroma that momentarily distracts from the tower's foreboding presence."
