      "An imposing tree stands to the side of the home-littered path, the haon's gnarled branches providing a perch for a pair of grey-ruffed vultures searching for carrion.  The trunk has been littered with piles of small bones and beaks, the remains of a small carcass buried amongst the leaves and cartilage."
