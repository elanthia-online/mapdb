    "description": [
      "Someone has excavated a hole approximately twenty feet wide, ten feet deep and roughly circular in shape out of the solid rock.  The miner's whereabouts is not apparent, however, and just how long ago this enterprise took place is difficult to judge.  The tools strewn around the pit are not rusted in the least, although they do show signs of considerable wind erosion on their wooden parts.  A few piles of rubble remain, but no gems.  The wind has long since removed the operation's dust."
