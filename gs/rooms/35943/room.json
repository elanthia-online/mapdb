      "Scattered throughout the uneven terrain are large and small boulders covered in yellow and green moss.  Apple trees stretch their crooked arms to the aurora-painted sky, their spindled limbs clacking together in a faint breeze.  Slouched against a large box, a dirty gjenganger boy plays with a stick next to a large wooden frame, a bucket filled with pile of wooden tokens rests just beneath the frame."
