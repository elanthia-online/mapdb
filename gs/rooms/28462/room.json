      "Finespun brocaded tapestries conceal the walls of the tower, splitting before a recessed archway at the rear of the room.  The ceiling is swirled with darkly iridescent jewel-toned pebbles, the sunlight streaming in from a small bay window enhancing their colors and splashing over a paneled faewood wardrobe and a velvet-lined mossbark case.  Book-filled nooks flank the back of the space, drawing the eye to a bas-relief antique copper curio standing at the center.",
