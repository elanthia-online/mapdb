      "Elevated slightly, the greyish white boardwalk gently arcs over a small riverlet that is fed by a spring that spills down the distant cliff face in the southeast.  Cattails and reed canary grass grow in upon either side of the sun-bleached boards, sheltering small seashell pathways that lead to squat domiciles with colorful doors.  A smooth stone bench is placed in the center of the path, positioned to allow for a view of the lapping waters of the beach."
