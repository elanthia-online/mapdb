      "Framed by cloudy panels of bluish crystal, a wide fireplace dominates the rough-hewn western wall.  The scent of oiled leather rises from a singularly expansive couch positioned to benefit from the fire's heat.  Before it sits a low, wide refreshment table atop a snowy white warg pelt that contrasts brightly with the stone-tile floor below.  A northern archway proceeds into a cozy pantry, while a lacquered hoarbeam door breaks the carved granite of the eastern wall."
