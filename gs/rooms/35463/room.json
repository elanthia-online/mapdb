      "The leather scent of the hyrrad's walls mingles with that of the incense smoldering in a nearby hollowed turtle shell.  The combination of fragrances is both warm and slightly sweet.  Limber poles bow in arcs, framing the leather wrapped enclosure of the hyrrad, and a clutch of grass-stuffed mannequins guard the outer edge.  A flap of excess leather folds back to open a portal to the outside world, while also allowing in any errant breeze."
