      "Small waves roll slowly toward you, gently striking the grass at the lake's edge.  Other than the gentle lapping of the waves and the distant chirping of crickets from the north, no sound penetrates the tranquility of this lakefront.  A single candle lies on the ground before you, its wick long burned to dust and its golden beeswax polished smooth by the water.  Dozens more float in the distance, their tiny flames all dancing in the same rhythm.",
