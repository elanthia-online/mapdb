      "A dark stone cottage sits nearby, tendrils of creeping fig grasping at the structure's deep grey stones as they imperil visibility from the cottage's lone window.  The entire affair is saved from dourness by the brightly painted crimson door.  A small mithril plaque swings from the doorpost.",
      "A dark stone cottage is further darkened by sooty scorch marks.  Its crimson door is cracked in several places and hangs crookedly in the door frame.  Someone has nailed several boards over the opening, preventing entry into the shop.  A small mithril plaque hangs listlessly from the doorpost.",
      "A dark stone cottage stands back from the wey, its door and window frames painted a bright crimson.  Tendrils of creeping fig crawl along the stone, slender green shoots extending and unfurling from a base at the foundation of the building.  A small mithril plaque swings from the doorpost."
