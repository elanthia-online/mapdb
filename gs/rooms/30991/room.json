      "Small silver sconces set with panes of frosted crystal decorate the gold-flecked alabaster marble of the walls.  Set between the candelabra are dark mahogany bookcases, each filled with volumes in a wide range of shapes and sizes.  Thick carpeting of rich blue silk covers the stone floors adding elegance and warmth to the space."
