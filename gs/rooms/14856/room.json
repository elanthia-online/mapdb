      "A trail wends its way through a murky mix of stately oak, ash, and pine, while the dim silhouette of hawthorns loom in the lower shadows, with their flat-topped boughs and large, jagged leaves.  Visibility is limited on the trail by the dense growth of the trees as well as the lush rhododendron bushes between the boles offering fragrant sprays of blossoms that shine in the moonlight.",
