      "The shouts of traders drift over the slate-shingled rooftops of the shops to the south.  Evidently unbothered by the noise, an ancient halfling sits on a bench along the side of the road.  He twirls a slender blue wand between his fingers while lecturing to a group of young, attentive pupils.",
