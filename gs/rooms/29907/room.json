      "Rafters of raw pine stretch far overhead, lending the capacious hall a steepled roof.  Tall tables cluttered with earthenware plates and huge bone drinking horns crowd the plank floor, and beneath, the leavings of past meals exude a sour stink.  Both walls are adorned with hammered runes forged from bright copper, which glint and dance in the light of a monumental flame blazing from a dais to the east."
