      "A sweeping staircase of dark polished mahogany rises gracefully to the upper floors, the lofty stairwell illuminated by the soft, flickering light of a large silver candelabrum.  The rail curves in a graceful arc, its banister broad enough to slide down its length.  To one side of the landing, an arched doorway opens into a long, carpeted hallway that leads deeper into the hotel."
