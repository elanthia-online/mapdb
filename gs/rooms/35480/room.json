      "Centered under a pair of windows is a double-sided sink, which is built into a long, marble-topped counter along the southern wall.  Tucked into the corner at the end of the counter is an oak pantry with ornately carved doors.  A row of wooden stools are lined up at a small island in the middle of the kitchen, and stowed neatly beneath the island is a small rhimar-lined box."
