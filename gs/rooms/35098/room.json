      "Across from a series of wide bay windows, a long driftwood counter separates the cobbling workroom from patrons milling around the shop entrance overstocked with vendable supplies.  Bits of cork, strands of rope, and pieces of canvas protrude from a series of reed baskets hanging from a scarred beam.  An endless stream of plain paper-wrapped packages slide down a metal chute, some making it onto the smooth countertop, while most end up in a heap on the floor."
