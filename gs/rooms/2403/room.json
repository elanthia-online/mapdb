      "The cobblestones of Malt Road alternate in whites and wan ambers reminiscent of a pale ale's hue.  Merry whistling lilts through the traffic along the road, which mostly consists of merchants and porters with cask-laden wagons bound for local taverns and inns.  Dried herbs hanging from the eaves of a rickety cottage impart a sweet fragrance to the cold wind.",
      "The cobblestones of Malt Road are new enough to still have sharp edges.  Merrily whistling a tune, a delivery boy pushes along a cart with some oak casks on it.  The wheel of the cart just catches on the edge of a cobble, but the boy manages to right the cart before losing any cargo."
