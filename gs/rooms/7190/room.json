      "You are led right up against the mound's west slope, which meets the ground at a right angle.  The precision of the angle leads you to suspect that this hill is actually an earth-sheltered structure of some sort.  As you continue to explore, the brooding remnants of some ancient monoliths to the northwest cast a sense of abiding melancholy and sadness over the scene."
