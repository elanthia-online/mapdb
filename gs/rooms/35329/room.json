      "Framed by towering fan palm trees, the red marl and travertine avenue stretches to the southeast, while a smaller street of cobblestones departs from the main thoroughfare in a southwesterly direction.  Single story homes decorated with shutters and terra cotta roofs are built along the northwest and have small, pebbled pathways that connect them to the avenue.  Beyond the quaint abodes, the ground gives way to raw granite before plunging into the sea."
