      "A massive section of basalt, nearly half a foot thick, rests upon a squat silvery mithril pedestal.  The oval shape of the table is accented by a clear glaes edge that glows a tranquil yellow-green, complementing the light trickling through the curtained archway.  Stools crafted from native hardwood are stained black and reinforced with heavy strips of mithril."
