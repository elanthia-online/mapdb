      "Rising out of the cold earth, a sky-scraping pyramid of red stone overshadows the area, its cavernous entrance marked by a pair of colossal red stone pillars.  Traceries of rime glisten from its cyclopean walls, reflecting the dancing aurora in shimmering blues and wild greens, but it is a grim and beautiless place, a ruined echo of a monument built to evoke fear rather than wonder.  As if cowed by the display, the trees give the edifice a wide berth, leaving it in solitude amidst a grove cratered with steaming pools."
