      "Wrought iron hooks hang heavy wool cloaks and robes from the vert-colored back wall, the fabrics concealing the pentagram-painted floor boards, the loosened chips flaking across the circular border.  A blackened lasimor chest sits buried beneath piles of aged parchment, its broken lock discarded beneath a shelf of cloudy liquid-filled jars and torn bags spilling a fine powder across the floor.  A series of footsteps lay untouched across the white powder-covered planks, alongside a duo of cloven hooves."
