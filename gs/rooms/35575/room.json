      "Bone-white sands thin in a small, enclosed alcove where shallow pockmarks pit the coral walls.  Each hollow cradles pieces of reflective debris, such as tarnished plates, polished bowls, shards of mirror, or broken shields worn smooth by time.  Soft bioluminescent light ripples across the mismatched surfaces, sending scattered gleams drifting through the water.  A polished nacre mirror hangs near the entrance, while a barnacle-encrusted shell-shaped sign leans into a coral outcrop nearby."
