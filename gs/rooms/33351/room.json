      "Constructed from scavenged wood and cast off driftwood planks, the walls of the structure are a mixture of colors, textures, and types of wood.  Swathes of white, blue, and pale sea green Vornavian silk are hung along the walls, attempting to cover as much of the surface as possible.  A jagged driftwood plank hangs above the entryway door and a small barnacle-encrusted anchor rests in one corner.  Threadbare carpets lead off in every direction."
