      "White stucco dominates the pine wall to the east, creating a stippled backdrop for a mural depicting a raid on the Shattered Coast.  Flickering light from a nearby brazier casts shadows upon the rafters where a variety of ancient boarding hooks dangle from wrought iron cleats.  Music and laughter trickles into the hallway from a set of descending steps and a nearby archway."
