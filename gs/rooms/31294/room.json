      "The open air is blocked slightly by swathes of woven palm fronds that drape from the thatched roof to cover two of the walls.  A small firepit warms the area in the center of the room.  Several small hooks on the cocobolo support poles dangle random objects that swing in the breeze.  A reed curtain leads to the front room."
