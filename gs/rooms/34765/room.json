      "A fresco stretches across the northern wall of the temple's sanctuary.  Staring gravely down upon a raised dais occupied by a bone-inlaid ebony altar, a smallish man with emotionless blue eyes and an agile build is framed by a field of shadows.  The legs of the altar sprout from a pile of skulls heaped at its base.  The bones are of a wide variety of sizes and shapes, unalike but united in death."
