      "Warped and slightly waterlogged, an uneven floor causes the northern end of the shop to be higher than the southern end.  Thick, heavy rugs drape across the ground to keep out the damp of the wetlands beyond, while a cozy fire helps to keep the space comfortable and warm.  Scribbled notecards hang above a small stove, the writing utterly illegible, while a small oak bookcase housing dozens of cookbooks dominates an opposing wall."
