      "Due to the narrow nature of this channel of water between the towering rocks in the west and the imposing cliffs to the east, the shadows seem prominent as night settles in.  Shafts of moonlight reflect like diamonds from the glistening surface of the ocean, creating ethereal illumination in the more shallow shoals near the shore.  Dotting the wall of the cliffs are several gull nests, occupied by the resting birds as they prepare for another day of hunting."
