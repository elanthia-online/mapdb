      "A large wooden retaining wall holds back the jungle at this point, with massive treetops soaring high above.  A chubby red-bearded dwarf leans casually against an oak-framed sign near an elaborate runestaff lathe and a wrought iron staff rack beneath the sheltering canopy.  Underfoot, the ground is marshy and moist despite a liberal application of straw to assist with footing.  A series of oddly shaped benches sits at the foot of the wall, and the air is heavy with the scent of wet, loamy soil."
