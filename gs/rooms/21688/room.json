      "Stone walls wrap around to form a solid enclosure to the courtyard, the ground smooth and paved with dark cobblestones.  Barely visible beyond the thick iron gate stretches North Ring Road and an expanse of the palisades of Wehnimer's Landing.  A large two-story brick building dominates the far end of the courtyard, its roof topped with a black and grey flag."
