      "Icy slush sloshes against a half-frozen shore riddled with gravel and smooth stones, the telltale tracks of small creatures evident in the mud.  Tall dead reeds obscure the land to the south but part to provide an almost panoramic view of the Locksmehr River littered with frozen chunks of ice.  A fur-covered rough oak bench rests to one side of a snow-lined gravel trail, its legs covered in small piles of snow."
