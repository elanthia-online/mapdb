    "description": [
      "Intense heat emanates from a glowing red pile of twisted weapons in the back corner of the desolated interior of this shop.  Thick wooden beams are irreparably scorched, once supporting the remnants of wooden racks that displayed merchandise on the now rubble-littered floor.  Colorful glass fragments mark the walls, deformed where they have melted into the soot-stained stonework.  A splintered section of the ceiling hangs dangerously low, and all but the shortest visitors must duck to avoid its jagged edges."
