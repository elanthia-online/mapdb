      "Terracotta pots and containers of dark green fauna cover the walls of the room, leaving vines to entwine along the lotus-shaped bronze hooks interspersed in a haphazard fashion.  Stray beams of light cast scattered shadows along the ebonwood-planked floor of the shop, highlighting the iridescent beetle carapaces that are inlaid into the wood.  Set within the middle of the room is a sigil-carved marble stand, upon which a leather-bound volume sits between two melted tapers."
