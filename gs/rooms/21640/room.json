      "Looking large enough to house hundreds of people at a time, the room still feels crowded by the closely spaced benches.  Long oak tables line the length of the room with matching lines of benches beside them.  A small podium stands against the western wall with a thick leather-bound book atop it.  Judging by the savory smells drifting from the south, the swinging door set in the south wall leads to the kitchen."
