      "Cold emanates from the looming eastern cliffs, the pale grey granite marbled with sparkling spirals of frosty rhimar.  Glacial ice is wedged in the sparse cracks fracturing the craggy rock face.  Their tapered tips drip slowly, pooling into a shallow puddle over the lightly trodden path.  Ringed by plushly folded goat hides, a fire blazes in a circular clearing surrounded by mountain brome, offering a contrasting respite from the persistent chill."
