      "Auroral lights paint the twilight-kissed sky, a vibrant backdrop for the beheaded obsidian obelisk standing sentinel over a tranquil pond ringed in horsetail reeds.  Visible beneath the surface, the severed point glistens in the soft illumination emanating from multitudes of floating, ghostly white lotuses.  Polychromatic orbs spin in a whirling dance above the crystal clear water."
