      "Fluttering like a butterfly in a jar, the weak light of a glass-lined ring casts indistinct shadows across the golden tiles and the high lunar walls of the basin.  Dust, the sound of it like sand trickling over an umbrella, rains upon the arcane dome that forms a protective shielding high above the area.  Flashes of light to the north and east mark the origin of the impact tremors that vibrate through the air."
