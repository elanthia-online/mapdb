      "The terra cotta tiles of the floor have been arranged in a pattern of repeating half-diamonds, a theme picked up by the weapons crossed against the whitewashed walls.  Blades of every shape and size are paired along both sides of the corridor, ranging from two onyx-handled bodice daggers to a pair of wrought iron claidhmores."
