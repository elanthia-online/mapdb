      "Brightly colored flowers speckle the thick, verdant green bushes that threaten to choke the seashell paths that lead in and out of the other portions of the garden, their mother-of-pearl bellies glittering in the golden sunlight.  A thatch-roofed red cedar hut occupies much of the space in this section of the garden, its roof beaded with dew and its walls slick with teardrops of moisture.",
