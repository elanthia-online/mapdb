      "The way narrows along the ocean face of V'tull.  It winds across the great curve of the burning mountain in a spindly ribbon, disappearing into a sulfurous mist that even the harsh winds of the eastern shore cannot disperse.  A thick river of lava pours across the road, overflowing one of its many channels.  It will cool soon, no doubt, but for the time being the road ends here."
