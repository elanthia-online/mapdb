      "Though no less fierce, the wind loses its wintry chill as the road reaches a narrow fissure spanned by a black stone bridge.  Dozens of feet down, lava surges sluggishly, giving off an overwhelming odor of molten metal.  Waves of heat wash up from the breach, distorting the air around the bridge in a way that makes the tenebrous expanse seem to dance and shift."
