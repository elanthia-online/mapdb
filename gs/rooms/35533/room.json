      "The air is hot and close in this grotto.  The stone walls here are slick with water that gently cascades down them, disappearing via thin drains carved into the base of each wall.  To one side of the room, several driftwood crates are piled.  To the other, a coral-hued strongbox, an ultramarine trunk, and a stone chest are set upon a damp, fibrous mat alongside a chiseled stone sign.  A dark stone tunnel leads deeper into the grotto, while a gem-set stone arch leads out."
