      "Cool and dark, the chiseled stone tunnel echoes with the distant sound of crashing waves and the hushed tones of visitors to the Wandering Eye Market.  Bronze lanterns are anchored to the wall above an acacia and copper bench that keeps company with a banded wooden barrel.  Twin urns, glossy and tangerine in hue, rest beneath a verdigris copper contraption that creates a gentle rain."
