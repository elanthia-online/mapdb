      "Two unlit torches are mounted on either side of the bailey gate leading back out to the city.  A trio of well-traveled paths has been trampled through the grass leading off to the north, west, and east.  Various shoppers can be seen entering the area and heading off down the paths towards shops located throughout the grassy sward.",
      "The light cast from the two burning torches on either side of the bailey gate illuminates the area.  A trio of well-traveled paths has been trampled through the grass leading off to the north, west, and east.  Unidentifiable persons can be seen entering the area and heading off down the paths towards lighted shops located throughout the grassy sward."
