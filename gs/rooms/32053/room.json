      "Bright purple hues from the auroral twilight sky lend a diffuse luminosity to the dense mists hanging in the air.  Cushioned with an overgrown mass of vivid yellow and magenta flowers, a crescentic islet cuts through the curving stream, splitting it in two.  The heavy haze blurs the intense colors of the flourishing blossoms and viridescent foliage to a painterly effect."
