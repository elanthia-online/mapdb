      "Large ropes suspend the gazebo over a clearing in the forest below.  A massive iron brazier is hung at deck level from the center of the ceiling.  Cushioned, low back cedar chairs and small side tables are arranged about the deck.  Some paper lanterns are suspended from the ceiling for nighttime entertaining.  In the distance, the chromatic spray of Rainbow Falls can be seen through the trees.  Branching off in separate directions are rope bridges, each terminating in one of the doors to the different tree houses."
