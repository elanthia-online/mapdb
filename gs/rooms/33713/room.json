      "Secluded behind drapes of interwoven vines, an oversized, downy feather bed nestled in a cradle of curving branches is situated in the center of a lofty platform overlooking a lush garden.  A near-perfect circular opening in the canopy overhead acts as a skylight, offering a glimpse beyond the verdurous sanctuary.  Thrown over a gnarled branch of a prodigious, hollow-trunk tree, a length of knotted rope dangles over the pooling water of a woodland waterfall below."
