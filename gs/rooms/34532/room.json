      "Wrought from burnished gold, an elaborate chandelier suspends from the arched ceiling, illuminating the carefully folded contents of a series of bins arranged in the center of the wagon.  Myriad jackets hang on gilded hooks, organized by size, with the frontmost piece serving as a display dressed up with pocket squares and knotted cravats.  A gilt-threaded satin rope gathers a wine-hued velvet curtain to one side, creating deeply shadowed folds in the lush fabric."
