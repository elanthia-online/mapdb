      "Resting on the plush, cerulean carpeting is a frosted glass cabinet that contains an assortment of crystal figurines.  A black velvet painting depicting a school of dolphins flanking both sides of a fishing vessel hangs on the wall opposite the door.  Placed directly on both sides of the doorway are identical copper pots containing snapdragons in full bloom."
