      "Spent tallow candles huddle together atop a blue-green seaglass altar that has been erected just beyond the reach of the highest tides.  The monument is obviously old, its edges worn smooth and its base half-buried in the sand.  Several tokens lie in a heap of kelp before it, coins, bits of scrimshawed bone, and copper jewelry commingling freely in the bed of rubbery seaweed."
