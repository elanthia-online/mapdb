      "Small woodland creatures are carved into the length of the wide mistwood pillars that make up the sturdy frame of the tent.  Large spans of willow green silk cascade down the structure, blending into a thick carpet of the same hue.  Tiny blossoms crafted from colorful crystals hang from an enormous chandelier, coloring the room with a kaleidoscope of iridescence."
