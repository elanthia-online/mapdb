      "Merchants wander the stump-lined, muddy road, hawking their wares in front of a large, open-air forge.  Across from the forge, an iron-banded oaken trough filled with water is attended by a painted mare and her young filly.  A hunter green banner bearing a gold rolton snaps back and forth atop a tall pole, the caprine appearing to move in the breeze.",

Across from the forge, an iron-banded oaken trough filled with water is attended by a painted mare and her young filly.  A red banner bearing a platinum lion snaps back and forth atop a tall pole, the great snake appearing to move sinuously in the breeze.",

Across from the forge, an iron-banded oaken trough filled with water is attended by a painted mare and her young filly.  A royal blue banner bearing a golden serpent snaps back and forth atop a tall pole, the great snake appearing to move sinuously in the breeze."
