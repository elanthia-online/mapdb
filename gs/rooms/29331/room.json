      "The bustle of the main thoroughfare presses on around three glowing ethereal music stands as a thin layer of dense fog churns underfoot.  Lingering in the air, an ethereal cittern plays an inspiring tune, though no one is there to strike its strings.",
      "Torches and lanterns from the black sand beach below appear as tiny specks through three glowing ethereal music stands whenever the fog lifts to reveal the grandeur of the inky black sky.  Lingering in the cool, still air, an ethereal cittern plays an aimless tune, though no one is there to strike its strings."
