      "A natural rock formation catches the water from the spring before spilling over the far side, making the small basin deep enough for several giants to relax comfortably.  Lush greenery surrounds the rocks due to the high temperatures exuded by the water's surface.  On the eastern side of the bath is the nearest snow-capped mountain face, with a grand view of the back of the lodge to the south.  Local birds have settled in the surrounding trees, with sounds of offspring coming from the nests."
