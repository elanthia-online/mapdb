      "Lying on its side in a dried-up riverbed, a fishing barge has surrendered to the surrounding cataclysm.  With its cabin crushed by a huge black pyroclast, the boat would be useless even if it were near to water, but none is in sight, the river's flow having been disrupted by the convulsions of the earth.  Char mars the intact wood of the hull in patterns reminiscent of grasping talons."
