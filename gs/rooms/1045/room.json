      "Lofty pines compete with billowing spruces for light and moisture in the extensive forest to the north.  The odor of pinesap combined with the scent of decaying needles wafts out from the serene forest's cool, shady confines.  To the southwest the trail lazily follows the edges of the forest, jogging here and there to avoid a particularly thick tree trunk.  To the southeast it rolls off into the moor, a barely perceptible path of matted grass, until a thick bank of fog swallows it entirely."
