      "Tidy and compact, the narrow room has banded blue and green walls decorated with pale yellow oleander flowers.  Facing the open door, a plump floral armchair occupies a space near a window, while a narrow four-poster bed with a carved mahogany washstand is arranged opposite.  An oak-framed standing mirror of polished copper and mahogany rests beside a floral changing screen."
