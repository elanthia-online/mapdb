      "The ice glistens brilliant white, dazzling your eyes.  Frigid wind howls across the landscape, chilling you to the very marrow of your bones.  Upslope, to the west, you see a dark spot that might be a cave.  Even if it's not very deep, it might provide shelter for a while.",
      "The cold blue-white radiance of the ice in the moonlight makes it difficult to judge distances.  Frigid wind howls across the landscape, chilling you to the very marrow of your bones.  Upslope and to the west, you see a dark spot that might be a cave.  Even if it's not very deep, it might provide shelter for a while."
