    "description": [
      "Patches of tri-colored lady-slippers cluster around the bases of buttonwood trees.  Approximately one half of an inch from the sodden ground, the sagging royal blue, white and blood-red pouches of the flowers flutter softly, caressed by the gentlest of breezes.  Two trees have twisted themselves around each other and a thick mat of creeping dogwood has covered their roots.  The gnarly boles of the trees are covered with slimy, bluish mold."
