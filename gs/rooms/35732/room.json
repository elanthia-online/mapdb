      "Planks of sun-blanched oak stretch beneath tangled rigging, their grain slick with sea spray and multicolored mosses.  Tendrils of kelp snake between rusted portholes not far below the gunnels, shards of glass from their shattered windows littering the rocks of the islet below.  A fallen lantern lies atop a pile of waterlogged planks, its oil reduced to a stain on the deck and a ghost of sweetness on the salt air."
