      "Hanging mirrors are positioned around the perimeter of the entrance, reflecting light from a lantern to the southwest.  Ash and soot mingles with the earthy dirt on the ground to the northwest, the blending of their natural hues staining the bottom of a hanging doorway that leads out.  Roughly hewn beams of ironwood support thick, patchwork walls and a ceiling decorated with dark silks that hang from taut ropes overhead."
