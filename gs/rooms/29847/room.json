      "The oaken floorboards of the airship's decks slope sharply, making navigation difficult.  Most of the furniture is in a pile at the hull, except for a few trunks and chests that remain lashed to the bulkheads on either side of a narrow ladder leading below deck.  A large cabinet lies on its side, the doors smashed open, revealing a small cache of weapons inside."
