      "Polished white marble floors reflect the lights of pendant lanterns anchored to the ceiling, the combination of reflected light and soft glow from above effectively illuminating the space and dispelling any chance of shadows.  An arched corridor leads back to the central lobby of the bank, while twin arches in both the northwest and southeast provide services.  Cushioned in velveteen, a series of seats encircle a potted dwarf resaeun sculpted into a full cascade."
