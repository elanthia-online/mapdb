      "Tucked into the northeast corner where Changeling and Plover meet, a lavender-awninged shop stands with dried herbs and small barrels of peppercorns and dried peppers ranged about the entrance.  Providing the area with the mixed scents of a variety of spices, the shop appears to do a brisk business in spite of its unobtrusive location, and the customers leaving the shop appear to have consistently satisfied expressions on their faces.",
      "Tucked into the bend where Changeling and Plover meet and bordered to the north by a broad span of beach, a large domed building stands between twin silver-twined poles of Cairnfang pine.  Occasionally, multicolored bubbles drift from its entrance, carried on husky breaths of air flavored with hints of rose, cinnamon, and other luxuriant scents.  The lapping waves of the Glaive whisper gently over the sea breeze."
