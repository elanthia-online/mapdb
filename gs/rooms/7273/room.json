    "description": [
      "A pile of uprooted trees lying across the creek creates this natural dam that holds back the scummy green waters.  The waters contain the slimy remains of putrifying vegetation and carcasses.  A dragonfly skims the surface, causing concentric ripples to radiate out from its landing spot.  Looking down, you see the dry remnants of the creek bed."
