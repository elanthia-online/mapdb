      "Even rows of black marble tombstones march along the soft green grasses near the entrance of the lichyard, only halted in their precise procession by the roots of dark-boled bloodwoods dotting the grounds.  The cool breeze carries distant birdsong and the occasional creaking of the cemetery gate, but otherwise it is as if a pall of silence hangs over the graves.  A mausoleum resting in the shadow of the fence is grander than the surrounding tombstones and is intricately carved with bas-reliefs."
