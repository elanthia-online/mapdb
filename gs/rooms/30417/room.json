    "description": [
      "The orange-pink coral hugging Charl's Teeth serves as far less an intense display from this vantage point.  Its height and density shrunken to but a small expense visible above the surface of the waves, the reef appears almost as if releasing its tenuous hold on the obsidian rocks in readiness to fully retreat back into the hidden recesses of the blue seas."
