      "The scent of oil mixes with that of pine in front of a narrow storefront.  The bear pelt mat before it is stained and matted.  From the east come sounds of clicking and clacking, so consistant as to almost be a chant.  The wall bordering the road is stained in one place with a few dark red-brown handprints."
