      "A worn red carpet covers a narrow strip of the hallway's hardwood floor from end to end.  The exposed floor shines as if polished daily, and no cracks or crevices appear anywhere in the length of the hallway.  A low, narrow table placed between two doors on the left and opposite the center door on the right sports a vase of fresh flowers."
