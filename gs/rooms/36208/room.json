      "A freshwater stream cuts through the jungle, winding its way toward a larger saltwater river visible through the thickets of banyan and teak.  Cinchona trees create tiny bowers here and there between the two waterways, and colorful flowering vines add pops of color to the verdant surroundings.  A trail winds its way through a dense thicket to the west, while the stream-bordering path continues in a mostly northerly fashion.  A teak railing inset with a carved sign separates the path from the stream."
