      "Mineral deposits reminiscent of spent candle wax cascade down the face of a short cliff, offering easy handholds on the way up to a raised tunnelway.  Stalagmites crowd the cavern floor, their spindly forms elongated as if they are stretching to reach their mated stalactites on the raised ceiling.  Water drips musically over the raised ledge, echoing strangely off of the forest of stone."
