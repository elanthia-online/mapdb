      "The massive stone bridge slopes gently downwards toward the city walls, its graceful arc and delicately interspersed cobbles belying the sheer weight and magnitude of its construction.  City guardsmen line the bridge at irregular intervals, some exchanging quiet conversation while others merely stand and watch the passersby.",

A few city guardsmen line the bridge at irregular intervals, some exchanging quiet conversation while others merely stand and watch the moonlight play upon the surface of the Mistydeep River."
