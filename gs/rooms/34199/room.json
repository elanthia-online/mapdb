      "Cobweb-fine threads of rusty silk dangle from the ceiling.  Their anchors cluster more densely to the north, wherefrom a damp draft blows.  Along the pitted floor of the passage, mottled discolorations paint an abstract pattern of unknown provenance.  Tiny crystals protrude from the stone walls, their facets jagged and chipped, their colors muted in the darkness beneath the mountains."
