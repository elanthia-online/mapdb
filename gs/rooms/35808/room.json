    "description": [
      "Almost at the top of the canopy and breaking past the reach of most surrounding trees, much of the vast skyline opens up and affords glimpses over the surrounding montane.  A smooth handcarved bench outfitted with a thick seat cushion and several small pillows provide a comfortable setting to sit and gaze.  Winking glints of light flash as viewing angles capture sight of obscured lakes or meandering rivers through the forest."
