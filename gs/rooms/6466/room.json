      "A high cliff runs from east to west, forming the southern edge of the lake.  The surrounding forest grows down to within a few feet of the lake shore at this point.  There is even one old willow that grows at the very edge of the lake; the gnarled roots of the old tree dipping into the water, reminding you of an old man attempting to cool his tired feet."
