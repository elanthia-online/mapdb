      "Awestruck by the opulence of your surroundings, you notice that the walls appear to be made of lustrous, black-veined white marble.  The floor is a mosaic of white marble inlaid with squares of gleaming black onyx.  A hand-woven carpet of intricate detail and rich, deep coloring covers the floor before a great fireplace of white marble and antiqued silver."
