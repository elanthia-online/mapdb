      "Numerous jars of tea leaves cover the shelves of the curtain-draped shop, the colorful glass containers flanking a ceiling-high rich mahogany cabinet kept far from the bustle of the entrance.  Laurel-encircled wicker bins are artfully arranged between murals of forestry and fortresses, the artwork framed in gilded bronze."
