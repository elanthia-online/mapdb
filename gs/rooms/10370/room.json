      "Golden light filters into the chamber from a diamond-paned glaesine skylight high above.  Raw silk carpets cover the floor and the pale undecorated walls have the smooth ivory gleam of aged lime plaster.  A carved haon altar sits upon a small dais.  Atop the altar, a lone white candle burns steadily.",
