      "A long walkway extends down the side of the granite building, lined by a series of statues placed at regular intervals along the outer edge.  Fashioned in the form of Elven men and woman, each stone figure is engaged in some mundane, domestic activity.  It is as if the artist wished to encourage a feeling of familiarity and peace in those who viewed his works."
