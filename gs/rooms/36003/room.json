      "Powerful columns of limestone anchor the corners of this ample room, rising high to brace the double-vaulted ceiling.  Some rush-seated oak chairs are clustered around a polished granite hearth in the northwest corner.  Lit by blazing torches on either side of a beveled glaes mirror, a large oak table along the south wall holds a laden refreshment tray.  Twin banners of a sword and shield flank the limestone arch into this hall, above which is set a silver-inlaid granite medallion."
