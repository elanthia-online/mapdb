      "A large garden spreads out on a higher patch of land.  Randomly placed flowering bushes compete with blooming shade trees and organized flower beds to fill the area with color and scent.  Narrow, well-maintained paths wind through the serene landscape, occasionally passing by the metal rocking chairs set under each shade tree.  Bees busily harvest pollen, buzzing rapidly from flower to flower, and a small family of ducks noisily roots in the underbrush, searching for a next meal.",

Torches set every few yards brightly illuminate the garden, allowing the flowers to display their colors at night."
