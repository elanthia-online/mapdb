      "The trail ends at a stand of quaking aspen, their distinctive leaves fluttering although little breeze is evident.  Grass has reclaimed the ground from the pine needles, and it grows in a lush green carpet studded with small mushrooms.  A few cottages ring the clearing, their edges blurred by the mist drifting off the lake."
