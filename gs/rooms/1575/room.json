      "Looking more like an oversized stall than a shop, the wooden wall panels of the western-most business have been swung open to allow customers to more easily enter and examine the wide variety of items for sale.  A silver-painted breastplate hangs from the second story of the storefront.  The bustle of the South Market continues to the west along a substantial pier, and a catwalk extends to the northwest behind the Market's row of east-facing shops."
