      "Departing from the business district to the north, the small homes of Comyner's Ward huddle against southern sections of the New Ward Wall.  Here and there, large date trees spring to life in the surrounding sandy dirt of the small domiciles, their striped trunks surrounded by tufted clusters of bright pink muhly grass and white-tipped feather grass.  Dormant torches line the stucco-faced wall, each burning with small flames that collectively illuminate the area."
