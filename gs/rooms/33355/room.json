      "The rooftop of the building is lined with a series of barrel planters, each sprouting a vibrant pink display of seaside daisies.  Residing under a waxed sailcloth awning is a mosaic glass Niima statue, her eyes looking out over Solhaven Bay.  A polished brass ship's lantern rests on the driftwood plinth beneath the statue, its surface polished and smoothed by the touch of countless hands.  A battered driftwood hatch leads back inside the building."
