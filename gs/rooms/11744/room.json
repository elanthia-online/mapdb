      "Flickering light comes from the torch mounted in a rusting metal bracket next to an iron door.  The flame sputters off and on as if low on fuel, providing just enough illumination to reveal a dead-end formed by a solid wall of bricks glistening with beads of moisture.  An unidentifiable stench drifts into this end of the hallway from the west."
