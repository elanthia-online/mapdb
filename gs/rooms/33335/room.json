      "Just beyond the end of a towering blue stone arch, the stone and dirt path dead-ends into a blood-red stone wall.  Though the surface of the rocky rise is replete with crags, so too is it slicked with the downpour and the foliage of exotic plants that sprout from the multitudinous crannies."
