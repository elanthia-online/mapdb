      "Silver moonlight pours down over the terra cotta tiled rooftops of the whitewashed cottages lining the avenue, dappling them in a cool purplish hue.  A soft breeze rustles the awnings that hang above each window, breaking the silence with the sound of canvas against canvas.",
      "A row of small, whitewashed cottages lines each side of the path, the varying hues of their terra cotta roofs the only thing distinguishing one from another.  A soft breeze rustles the awnings that accent the homes, cooling the warm air for a moment before settling down and allowing the sunlight to beat down once more."
