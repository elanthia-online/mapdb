      "The low ceiling makes this short hallway cramped and uncomfortable to be in.  Less care and craftsmanship seems to have been put into this area of the structure.  The walls and floor are a bit uneven and a sheen of slimy moisture covers the walls.  The hallway bends slightly, curving around from the north to the southwest, and a low wide archway opens on the east wall."
