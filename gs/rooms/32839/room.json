      "Shades of golds and greens create beautiful patterns in the rich ramie silk carpet that blankets the polished tanik floor.  A flyrsilk ivory curtain and a sun-faded sailcloth curtain are draped on either side of the hallway with a marble hummingbird statue resting to the side of each.  Frosted crystal globes hang from the ceiling illuminating the area with a pale, flickering light."
