      "Silver-hued driftwood planks form the finished facing of the stable's walls, while thick ship ribs provide structural support.  Lanterns are bolted to the inverted keel at even intervals, the bright illumination dispelling shadows and highlighting a tidily swept birch floor.  Tacked to a central post is a crisp vellum chore list outlining the duties of any proper horse owner, the lone lantern above it shedding light upon the east-facing door just beyond."
