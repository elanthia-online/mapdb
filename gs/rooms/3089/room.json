      "The remains of the ice quarry operation, shut down long ago by avalanches crashing down from the mountainsides, are visible here.  A tall berm has been constructed along the outer edge of the pit, blocking and rerouting the dangerous falls.  Some enterprising group has created a neighborhood that circles what remains of the operation, turning the dangerous area into an attraction of sculptured snow."
