      "There is no noticeable trail through the foothills, though occasionally, there are evident patches of flattened grass or footprints that are smaller than a halfling would make.  Every once in awhile, an oversized cricket jumps from the grass, chirping as it quickly hides again amongst the wildflowers.",
