      "Silvery light casts its luminous net across the rippling waves of the ocean, its gently cresting edges pearly white with salty froth as they lap at the distant shore and the nearby Teeth of Charl.  Shadows rise from the depths, their angular heads briefly breaking water before the wide oval of their backs and reveal themselves to be a small migration of sea turtles.  They slowly sink into the depths, their geometric-patterned backs catching brief snatches of light before they silently disappear."
