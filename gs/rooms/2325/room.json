      "Serene silence blankets the roadway, broken only by the gentle babbling of ice water dripping from a runnel in the glacier to splash the base of one of the accompanying street lamps.  Most of the hustle and bustle is confined to the nearby temple, leaving the roadway lightly peopled.  A subtle pattern of interlocking rings, lightly rimed with icy filigree, is picked out in the cobblestones.",
      "This area is very quiet except for the serene sounds of a tiny runnel of icy water tripping down the edge of the street.  Most of the hustle and bustle seems to be in front of the Temple, leaving this place devoid of activity.  A subtle pattern of interlocking rings is picked out in the cobblestones, lightly rimed with ice."
