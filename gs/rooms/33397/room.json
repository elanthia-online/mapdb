      "The humid, sub-level facility is dimly lit by several mushroom-shaped lanterns affixed to the rock walls, casting a steady, subtle light across a window-inset door.  Thin-framed enclosures, filled with a variety of straw, dirt, and lichen, are displayed in tidy rows along the sides of the spacious facility, the center occupied by a long table of live-edged ebony.  Recesses serve as moss-draped bookshelves beside the faenor-latticed egress, perpendicular to a blackboard framed in stylized fungi."
