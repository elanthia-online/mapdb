      "The whisper of running water can be heard somewhere further along the path, though the origins of the sound are hidden by a thickening layer of mist that has begun to blanket the ground.  Tendrils of it twist up the posts of the split rail fence and tease at the wan light cast by the metal-framed pendant lanterns mounted at intervals along the barrier."
