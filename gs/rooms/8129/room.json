      "The surrounding grey granite is veiled by darkness.  A large chunk of pyrite penetrates the veil near the ground, its multi-faceted shine buffed by passing beasts.  The polished golden metal would surely look fitting on anyone with a taste for the gaudy, if only one could find a way to easily remove it."
