      "Stark against the ruddy rock comprising the walls and floor, an archway of lightless black stone dominates the northern wall at the corridor's dead end.  Steps ascend to the archway, but beyond it is just a wall of cragged stone.  The walls to either side are painted with patterns of golden wings, the pigments enhanced with metal powder that makes the artwork glitter strangely."
