      "Glowing curtains of lichen cast strange illumination over a flat cavern wall that is covered with ancient etchings.  Spared the cruelty of the elements, they are deep-graven and simple, featuring long-limbed figures hunting, sowing, and harvesting.  At the center of the wall, a pair of round double doors gleams in the unearthly light, golvern rivets more brilliant than the precious veil iron from which they are predominantly wrought.  The vast entryway is dozens of feet high at its zenith."
