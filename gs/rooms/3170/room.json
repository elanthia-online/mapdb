      "[Frozen Garden, Narrow Trail]"
    ],
    "description": [
      "The trail narrows as it heads northward into denser thickets and wooded landscape.  Though numerous, the trees here are stunted and gangly as their barren branches reach outward to intertwine with their neighbors, as if to embrace each other for warmth.  To the northeast, the ground slopes downward towards deeper snow drifts."
