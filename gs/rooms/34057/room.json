      "Above the some tall golvern-framed double doors in the eastern wall, a trapezoid of foreign stone stands out against the smooth-hewn native rock.  Black as night and shot through with veins of silver, the decoration adorns the lintel over the doorway.  Nearby, a carved Ossian pine totem has been erected, its wood painted with a riot of striking colors, and a bowl full of wintercrisp apples, iceblossoms, and resting poppies at its base."
