      "A thin run of sparkling violet water flows in from the south, puddling here in a shallow pool that shimmers like a jewel touched by moonlight.  All around its borders and within its shallows grow exotic florals of wondrous size and colors:  lilies in shades of magenta and cerulean, lotuses of indigo with sunset orange hearts, and clusters of blush pink rose mallow.  Grasses create a fringe between the blossoms, velvety sprays in hues of blue and purple."
