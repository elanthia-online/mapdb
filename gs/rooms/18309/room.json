      "Clusters of fireflies gather upon the low-laying fronds of moriche palms, twinkles of glowing light blinking in and out amongst the tall grass that impede passage between the palms and the vine-laden trees as they crowd for space in the jungle.  Shadows dance about the thick vegetation sprawling over the damp jungle floor, and the quiet of night is broken by the rustles of nocturnal creatures within the dense surroundings.",
      "A small group of owl butterflies gathers upon the low-laying fronds of moriche palms, the pineapple-shaped red fruit born of the trees dangling in abundance from the joints of each frond.  Large clusters of tall grass impede passage between the palms and the assortment of vine-laden trees crowding for space in the jungle, while the rustling movement of local wildlife echoes in the dense surroundings."
