      "The pine-planked porch is centered by arched oak doors inlaid with three lapis lazuli chalices.  Nearly blending into the glacier at one end of the porch is a small door of pale spruce.  Overhead, a steeply canted pine awning stretches out across both, covering the otherwise open area.  The opposite end of the porch boasts a round firepit ringed by golden sandstone blocks and flanked by rocking chairs."
