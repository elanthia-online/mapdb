      "Narrow and ramshackle, the small shop is built in a small alley between more permanent structures.  Dirty oak planks are wedged between the left and right buildings to form a ceiling that is almost certainly too low for the average giantman.  Brass lanterns keep the wares displayed on several nearby hooks brightly illuminated throughout the day and night.  A coarse, striped blanket covers the ground as a sort of makeshift rug."
