      "Gently lit by lanterns lacquered with vivid blue roses, the far end of the tea room is a serene space framed by black curtains.  A cast iron stove graced by a pattern of brushed silver thorns stands near a lacquered black steel bin with compartments for tinder and logs.  Atop the stove sits a pale porcelain kettle painted with blue and green wisps."
