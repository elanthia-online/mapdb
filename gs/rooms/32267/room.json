      "A collapsed tower of stone and bone has succumbed to the flames, and banners fraught with demonic sigils burn amidst their crumbled walls.  Rumbling shakes the ground underfoot, the sound of it like a great roaring, though the only visible consequence is explosion after explosion of fire, dirt and rock spraying upward with the force of the flames."
