      "Constructed of stained oak panels that have seen better days, this squat building's low ceiling makes the space seem somewhat cramped.  Scattered on all of the walls are several dingy paintings, some of them hanging slightly crooked.  Taking up most of the room is a long display counter, its surface littered with wares for sale, while a swinging door leads further into the building.  The scent of strong cologne permeates the humid air."
