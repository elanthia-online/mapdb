    "description": [
      "The aroma of cooking seafood mingles with the raw odors of the sea carried by the onshore breeze.  To the west the pier widens to support a low, net-shrouded building.  Little more than a stone's throw to the northeast, the tarred timbers of the Market Bridge parallel the pier's stretch to Bayside Road.  Tight against the southern edge of the pier, an old shed appears to have been refurbished, and a wooden sign bearing a sea chest picture hangs above the door."
