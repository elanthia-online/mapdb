      "An oak framed double bed rests along the north wall, crisp white linen sheets and a soft knitted cotton spread adorning its feather mattress and pillows.  Glowing lanterns rest on nightstands at bedside, spreading their cheerful glow around the room.  Under a small, open window in the west wall is a loveseat.  Cotton curtains patterned in rose and pale green flutter in the breeze which carries the sweet scent of roses to fill this room.",
      "An oak framed double bed rests along the north wall, crisp white linen sheets and a soft knitted cotton spread adorning its feather mattress and pillows.  Unlit lanterns rest on nightstands at bedside, ready to spread their cheerful glow at night's fall.  Under a small, open window in the west wall is a loveseat.  Cotton curtains patterned in rose and pale green flutter in the breeze which carries the sweet scent of roses to fill this room."
