      "The forest draws back, leaving a moonlit meadow surrounded by its ominous ranks.  Devoid of rocks or other obstructions, the tall carpet of grass seems to extend a benevolent welcome, in marked contrast to the endless gloom of the wood.  A glance to the south evaporates any illusions of light, however.  There, a monstrous tree spreads its branches across the horizon, the boughs contorted and crooked and its foliage a pitch-black cloud.",
