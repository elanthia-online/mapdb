      "Beyond a rose gold and marble arch rests a small chamber with a low, rough ceiling, the floor composed of concentric blocks of stone.  Attended by several robed acolytes, a luminous sliver is suspended at the center of the room.  It crackles occasionally, bathing the surroundings in green and gold light."
