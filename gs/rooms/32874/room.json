    "description": [
      "The overgrown clearing is framed by a series of vine-covered statues.  A forest of old-growth trees with dense underbrush presses into the clearing, leaving very little room between it and the cliff's edge.  A hedge of overgrown roses provides a natural block from the wind and draws attention to the panoramic view.  A trail breaks through at the western edge, leading steeply down to the water below.  Barely visible within the trees is a broken moss-covered pathway, unusually thick masses of undulating vines and moss winding about the branches above."
