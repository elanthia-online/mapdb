      "The top of this small hill is littered with odd-shaped rocks and boulders, many of them very tall.  Carved into each stone are strange symbols and letters that form no words.  A loud, piercing whistle emanates from a flute-like tube carved into the top of a particularly tall rock formation.  Several clapperless bells are tethered to other rocks and swing soundlessly in the constant breeze."
