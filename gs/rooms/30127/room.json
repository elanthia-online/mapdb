      "Lanterns sway above an obsidian cocobolo table which runs the length of the hall, an obsidian cocobolo bench on either side providing ample seating for the ships crew.  Stacked in one corner, casks of hard cider, ale, and other assorted potations are on tap.  A scruffy dog lies sleeping beneath the table, a chewed bone tucked securely under one paw."
