      "Vaulted arches soar above the anteroom of the colosseum, proceeding toward a long, torchlit hallway in the north.  Statues of powerfully built men and women stand atop marble plinths at the bases of the support columns, their visages proud, imperious, and occasionally cruel.  Smaller alcoves to either side of the entrance house desks for the cashiers and clerks."
