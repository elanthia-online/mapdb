      "A massive fallen tree dominates most of this space, its trunk a dozen feet or more across has been painted with colorful rings surrounding a tiny silver mushroom.  From the visible decay and large collection of moss and fungi around its base, the tree fell quite some time ago, and the path has simply evolved over time to wind around it.  A cheerful Iyo warrior lounges against a nearby stump where a dull mithril hatchet is deeply embedded in the wood."
