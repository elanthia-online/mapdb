      "Chiseled from the natural stone wall, a bar, its surface textured with smooth, multicolored pebbles, is lined with a row of small stools.  A sweet aroma hovers around the jars and canisters that fill an iron rack behind a low counter laden with trays of empty mugs.  An open archway to the west provides a glimpse of the cobblestone patio beyond."
