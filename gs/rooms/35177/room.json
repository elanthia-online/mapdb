      "A trio of sharpened daggers pierces through the room's back wall, each weapon conveniently striking the eyes and mouth of the unknown portrait covering the torn vellum.  Several frayed bags litter the floor beside straw-layered crates filled with merchandise, the dried stalks spilling down upon the bloodstained floor.  Ink-stained tally marks mar the surface of the tall cabinet nestled in the corner, the glass-paned doors restrained by lengths of braided rope."
