    "description": [
      "Vornavis' West Wall looms just a few yards to the east, casting this tiny court in almost perpetual shadow.  As if seeking to mimic the Wall's height, the townhouses along the court are all three stories tall, but they have ended up leaning over the street as their timbers have sagged over the years.  In contrast, the east end of the court is occupied by a small, half-timber cottage with wooden shingles, a fieldstone chimney and a pair of blue-lensed lamps lighting its front door.",
      "The silhouette of Vornavis's western wall looms to the east, casting much of the cultivated court in its shadow.  As if seeking to rival the wall's height, the townhouses bordering its stone bulk are all at least three stories tall.  Hoarding the sole patch of moonlight in the yard is a small but tidy manor house with a silver-inlaid pale mistwood door, its sloping roof wrought of diamond-shaped verdigris bronze shingles.",
