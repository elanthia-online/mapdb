      "Behind the temple, this part of Niima's Isle has been hedged with bright pink wild roses, their fragrant scent light on the ocean breeze.  The view of Solhaven Bay and further out to the ocean's horizon provides a restful panorama.  A white marble fountain dominates the center of the lush surroundings, ringed by an occasional bench.  Leaping dolphins catch the sunlight with a silvery flash as they play among the waves.",
