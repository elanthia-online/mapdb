    "description": [
      "Tamped down from the steady passage of multiple feet, the grass fronds that line the riverbank are splattered with mud and covered in piles of icy slush.  Brightly lit torches are lashed to tall poles that jut out of the ground along a track that follows the river, providing limited warmth from the cold.  A gentle incline leads up the banks towards a sturdy dock bedecked with wreaths and pelts of heavy fur."
