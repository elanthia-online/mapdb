      "Deep drifts of orange and violet flowers grow wild along the edge of a muddy path cutting through patches of high grass in a glade of aspen mixed with oak saplings.  Not far off of the path to the east under the shadow of a copse of trees, a spring bubbles into a small pool, the cool, clear water inviting a variety of wildlife to take a sip.  A thick patch of white clover blossoms inside of a lopsided ring of reddish brown mushrooms."
