      "Small dunes of black sand flank the walls of the temple yard, flattening into traversable terrain near a silver-chased indigo arch.  The sands give life to only scant vegetation, with only a hint of bright green seagrass sprouting here and there.  A strip of stone walkway provides the sole means of crossing a dark, still pool of briny water that occupies much of the grounds.  On the other side, a squat temple of dark blue stone lurks, its architecture strange and grim."
