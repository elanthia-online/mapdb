      "So still as to produce a mirror-like surface, a pond lies motionless against its shore, where a stacked pile of smooth stones stands sentinel.  Diffuse veins of color crawl across the water's face, reflections from the wide stretch of open sky above.  The effect is disorienting, creating a tunnel-like mirage as the firmament and pond extend to the same fog-misted point on the horizon."
