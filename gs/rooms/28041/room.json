      "Heavily carpeted with coarse sawdust layers over a base of sand, the arena is large enough for multiple horses and riders.  Banners of platinum and vivid red grace the viewing stands to the west, with gilded and green flags rising on the east.  Bark-stripped pine poles form the lists, partitioning the lanes for two opposing riders.  Gouges and hoofprints mar the ground in both directions, with a smattering of blood and torn fabric proving this is not a sport for the faint of heart.",
      "Heavily carpeted with coarse sawdust layers over a base of sand, the arena is large enough for multiple horses and riders.  Banners of silver and plum grace the viewing stands to the west, with black, white, and cobalt blue rising on the east.

      "A milieu of potential combatants set about their preparations in this large, open field - readying themselves for the challenge ahead.  Beside a gold ribboned gate, an entry table accepts new registrants as they arrive.  Stableboys lead blue and gold caparison bedecked mounts from an enclosed paddock to each rider in turn.  Across the way, a large weapon rack and a display of shields provides selections for each rider to equip themselves before engaging in the contest that awaits."
