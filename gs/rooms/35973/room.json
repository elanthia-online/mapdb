      "Twisting forward like a game trail, the narrow track is hemmed close by bent trees whose arching limbs knit a low vault overhead.  Darkness thickens beneath their boughs, the air damp and heavy.  Nodule-ridden turquoise vines crisscross the ground in tangled knots, their thorny tendrils glistening faintly in the ambient light as they engulf fallen wood and overtake nearby brush.  Shadows deepen in the cramped passage, as if the forest itself leans inward to watch."
