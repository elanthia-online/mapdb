      "The low, grass-covered plain stretches off to the south and east, the foot-high grass speckled with clumps of trees and patches of taller vegetation.  The wind blows constantly across the plain, ruffling the grass in ever-shifting patterns of green and brown.  A trail winds up to a plateau of higher grass to the west.",
