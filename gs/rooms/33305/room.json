      "Winding a sinuous path away from the walled grasslands of Vornavis, a cobblestone path descends to the city from the verdigris copper gates of the holdings beyond.  Evenly spaced lanterns, little more than sturdy shepherd's hooks dangling bowl-like lanterns, shift and click as an almost continuous breeze tugs at them.  Faint, yet insistent, the roar of the Cascade of Tears is a steady drone in the background."
