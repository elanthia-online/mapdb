      "Hanging above a worn oak counter is a huge mirror that covers the length of the wall.  Various bottles and glasses are stacked on a shelf below, while barstools line the front.  Chairs are scattered on a thick wool carpet in front of a large stone fireplace with a small basket of sticks resting to one side.  Placed next to the doorway is a large brass spittoon."
