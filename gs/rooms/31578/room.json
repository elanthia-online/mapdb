      "Stacked stones and wrought iron fencing rises in a slow incline from the south to the north along this curve of the cobblestone road.  Enormous scrollwork gates offer passage down a well-trod dirt path that leads into the mist-laced graveyard, while cobbled steps lead to decorative brownstones with shutter-flanked windows.  Decorative urns filled with lilies hold the enormous gates open."
