      "The broad sweep of the granite floor is interrupted by a miniature Solhaven Bay model.  Halfway to the white stucco ceiling, a tattered merchant permit hangs on one of the painted white plaster walls.  A beveled glass-covered case and a spacious grey slate counter are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
