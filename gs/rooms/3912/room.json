      "The tunnel threads its way through a series of rock columns.  Each is carved in the image of a tree trunk, with finely rendered bark, branches and an impossibly complex pattern of leaves overhead.  Shadows intertwined within the boughs both hide and highlight variations within the carved foliage, yielding a strange effect of movement as if wind is playing through the frozen leaves."
