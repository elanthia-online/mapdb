      "Sage bushes thrive in the shadows of the limestone walls enclosing the meditation garden of the library.  The dry, herbal scent is strong in the air, lingering over the grounds like incense.  Flagstones wind between tufts of moon sedge, weaving beneath an ornamental arch of grey marble that is shot through with striking green and wan yellow veins.  Near the eastern gate of the compound, a statue of a elderly man stands near the path, holding a flame aloft in one gnarled hand."
