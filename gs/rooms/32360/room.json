      "Crumbling wooden planks hang broken and askew, pounded relentlessly by the frosty surf.  The sun-silvered wood is caked with rime and clusters of salt crystals that have built up over long years of disuse.  A frayed line dangles like a noose from one of the pilings, flapping ominously in the whipping wind.",
      "The wood of the westernmost pier has silvered unevenly, leaving a strange stripe pattern in the warped planks as they alternate between grey and black.  The nails securing the planks are spotted with rust that makes each look as if it sits in a pool of old dried blood.  Traceries of rime glisten from the wood, lending a glint of natural beauty to the manmade decay."
