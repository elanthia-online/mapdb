      "Sketches and plans detailing a wide variety of ships hang from the walls of the well lit shop.  The bright candles set in a series of iron lanterns flicker as a cool sea breeze blows through several open windows.  Carved from polished driftwood, a long counter is set against the back wall, its surface covered with ship models."
