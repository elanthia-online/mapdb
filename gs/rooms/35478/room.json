      "Tucked under the smoothly sanded oak planks of the peaked ceiling is a rather spacious loft that runs the entire width and nearly half the length of the cabin.  An intricately carved oak railing offers a view of the room below, broken only by a narrow slatted stairway.  Sunlight streams through a bay window, casting brilliant pools of light on the large braided rug that covers the floor.  Nestled opposite the window is a large four-poster bed, while a large oak armoire stands off to one side."
