    "description": [
      "The open-air walkway -- in truth a bridge -- spans a deep chasm between the Bard Guild sitting on the edge of the cliffs and the spectacular Aerie Auditorium poised upon a single pillar standing out from the ramparts.  The column tapers as it descends and from the height of the walkway it gives an illusion that the structure perched on top is floating on the head of a pin.  All along the low, moonlight-sparkled stone walls grow a tangle of wisteria vines with their fragrant cascades of blue flowers."
