      "Unfurled scrolls of pale vellum adorn the walls from floor to ceiling, the semi-translucent parchment highlighted in vibrant inks depicting various seaports of Elanthia.  A velvet-lined silvery haon box sits alongside an ebony cloisonne vase, the containers weighing down an aged map spread across a nearby ebonwood table, its surface covered in charcoal-drawn notes set within the margins.  At the far corner sits a glass-paned display, the stand encircled by fragrant bits of dried petals, the wooden frame carved in entwined ivy vines."
