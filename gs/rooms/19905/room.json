      "The forest grows deeper to the south, and the thick canopy of branches overhead allows only a filtered golden light that streams through the trees in scattered places, catching dust-motes and flitting insects in its beams.  Small paths have been cleared to houses set back among the trees.  A twig snaps nearby as some forest creature makes its way through the brush."
