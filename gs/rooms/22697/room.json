    "description": [
      "Near black in hue, the verdant foliage of the swamp creates a thick barrier that is difficult to move through, though not impossible.  Rotting vines dangle from above, their thickly corded lengths laden with rotting leaves and shaggy strands of moss, while below the ground is comprised of a sucking mud that has a thin layer of water running across it.  Several nearby trees bend toward the path and lend the space an enclosed, almost claustrophobic feel."
