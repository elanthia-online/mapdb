    "description": [
      "Undulating waves carry seaweed to the supports of the private pier, the tangled flora catching on the waterlogged wood.  A double-masted mistwood ship moors at the far end, a gangplank leading up to the sailless vessel.  To the north, ships of varying immensity line the public docks that stretch out to the misty, moonlit sea."
