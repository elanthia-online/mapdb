      "Even the heaviest steps fade to silence upon the plush silvery carpet that stretches from one wall to the other in this room.  Several small instruments are arranged on low tables, while comfortable chairs are scattered about for the comfort of listener and performer alike.  A wide window displays a clear view of the White Haven courtyard."
