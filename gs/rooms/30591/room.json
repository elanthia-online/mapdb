      "A long, weathered fence made of alternating pine and birchwood encloses a particularly large meadow and separates it from the surrounding wilds.  Snow has piled up in the four corners of this large paddock, while an oblong trail that has been shoveled nearly clean in the center, the exposed ground covered with hoof marks.  Near the back of the lot stands a well-constructed barn illuminated by several oil lamps near its doors."
