      "The overgrowth stops abruptly, opening into a wide grassy clearing that is still verdant but obviously manicured.  Centrally positioned, an immense marquee striped in teal and saffron flies a pennant decorated with a pair of toy bears playing pat-a-cake.  At haphazard intervals, the marquee's borders shift and blur uncannily, but the small signpost planted near the entrance proclaiming this \"The Gallivant\" remains steadfast.  A mossy cobblestone path skirts the edges of the clearing and disappears into some thick overgrowth to the northeast.",
