    "description": [
      "Needles cushion the earth beneath the acicular canopy provided by the copse of tanik and cedar trees, a fairy ring of luminous celestial blue toadstools pushing its way through the organic carpet.  In the center, a constellation-stitched lotus silk cloth covers a low table displaying an assortment of trinkets.  A capybara-carved jadewood rack stands before shaggy trunks partially obscuring a deteriorating cobblestone wall."
