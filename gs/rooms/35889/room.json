      "Opened, free-standing displays in this enclosed stall offer samples of various ruddy brown armors, from cloth and soft leathers to chain and plate.  One display has four distinct types of shields mounted to its opened doors, framing the suits of plate armor within.  Another supports an arrangement of horizontal poles supported by both sides of a large cabinet, each dangling robes and leathers of slightly different design and size.  A dwarven artisan attends to patrons as they approach to barter and haggle."
