      "Several canvas awnings provide protection from the elements, while a few cannons affixed to the outer deck provide protection from more intelligent threats, their polished barrels glinting in the moonlight.  Almost blocking movement easterly, dozens of crates are stacked high and covered in thick hempen netting weighted with glaes spheres.  A narrow path between the stacks is made more treacherous by the addition of patches of seaweed, barnacles, and the occasional misplaced cannonball."
