      "Erected around a raised platform of smooth sycamore planks, the small tent is slate grey and illuminated by a single lantern strung upon the cross-section of the oak supports.  Copper and bronze griffins are painted upon the walls, the bright beasts fending off the advances of a herd of golden stags and a pride of platinum lions.  A small desk sits directly under the brightly burning lantern, its drawers missing and its inkwell empty.",
