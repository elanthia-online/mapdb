      "To the north the tunnel slopes slowly downward, while to the south it levels out as it approaches a granite arch.  The sounds of picks on stone and rumbling carts emanate from beyond the arch.  A guard leans against the arch, carefully eyeing those that move in and out and occasionally exchanging a word or two with them.  One amber toadstool in a stone pot resides next to the arch, providing a little light for the guard and a bit of illumination for the rest of the mining tunnel."
