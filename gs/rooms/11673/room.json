      "The storage shack is a jumble of shattered barrels and stove in wooden crates.  A pile of old burlap bags lie in one corner, slashed open and crumpled like the shed skins of snakes.  Any grain that might have been in the bags has long since disappeared.   Dust and mold covers everything.  A set of crude steps lead up through a small trapdoor in the ceiling."
