      "Switchbacks with steep inclines weave between thickets and then empty out into large clearings, leaving travelers exposed to the unrelenting weather conditions.  Square blocks cut from granite slabs edge the entire length of the trail to prevent erosion of the pathway.  The techniques and approaches used to establish these trails show a proclivity in resourcefulness as well as extraordinary skill in environmental knowledge and analysis."
