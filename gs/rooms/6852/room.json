      "Sheltered from the worst of the winter gales, the left profile is still largely intact.  The solemn brow and aquiline nose bespeak of royal lineage. Locks of granite hair fall thickly over a chipped and fractured ear that cannot hear the shouts of mustered troops or supplicant peasants.  You also see a majestic beard of stone."
