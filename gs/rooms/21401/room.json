      "Hole-ridden and mud-stained carpeting spans from wall to wall, and the greyed floorboards beneath peek through the myriad of frayed openings.  The walls, likewise in a state of disrepair, must once have been a rich burgundy, but are now a washed-out hue that barely falls into the red family.  Here and there, scattered everywhere from the tabletops to the couch, are disembodied mannequin parts.  Eyeless heads stare out from the mantle, while limbless torsos rest propped in corners."
