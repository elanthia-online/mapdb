      "It is so dark the immediate surroundings are impossible to see.  The walls are rough with the sharp jagged protrusions one would find in the beginning stages of a tunnel being dug.  However cobwebs and dust belie the age of the crude passage.  Feeling around the unfinished tunnel walls reveals no obvious exits."
