      "Glass-paned double doors on the eastern wall look out the silhouetted apple trees of an orched dotted with drifts of snow.  High windows frame the chamber, allowing moonlight to stream in from a variety of angles.  It spills gently over snowflake-patterned grey divan that are draped with knit fraelhan blankets in a variety of autumnal hues.  A thick fringed rug patterned with colorful leaves softens the marble floor."
