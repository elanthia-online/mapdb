      "Large and wide, the leaves of the mangroves provide a comfortable shade from the heat of the day.  Sunlight trickles through the wide branches and pools in pockets upon the manicured lawns of the island, creating shadows where the golden light is unable to penetrate the foliage.  A series of terracotta pots, filled with several varieties of anemones, line a slender path which provides safe passage between the island's dock and a sprawling villa.",
