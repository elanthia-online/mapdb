    "description": [
      "The water is ice-cold!  Freezing trails of vapor form with each breath, and you wonder how long someone can take the cold before freezing into a solid block of ice.  Even though the pool looks frosty enough to form ice on its surface, you begin to feel slightly invigorated by the chilly water.  That feeling lasts for only a few moments though, before numbness begins to threaten your extremities."
