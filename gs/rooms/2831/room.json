      "The boulders level into a promontory, with the surrounding countryside spreading out below in a breathtaking view.  Below, at the cliff's foot, the river looks silver, sending sparkles of reflection up through the fog when persistent beams of light occasionally manage to make their way through the haze.  Another face of stone continues up the incline toward a ridge fringed with dark green conifers.",
