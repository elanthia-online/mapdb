      "The walkway opens up into a circular plaza, its edges cultivated with a variety of massive trees -- their heavy boughs offering a pleasant shade mingled with spots of sunlight.  A pale ivory fountain of a beautiful elven woman stands at the center of the plaza, casting forth an ever-renewed stream of water from her lithe, outstretched hands.  A quaint building stands to the east, its peaked roof shaded a dark blue while its pale walls are wrought with intertwined silver tracery.",
