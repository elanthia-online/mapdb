      "Heavy drapes, faded and worn, hang from tarnished brass rods over the frosted windows, the skeins of fabric parted enough to allow the violet, cerulean, and coral sky to paint in the room in its twilight hues.  Flanked by end tables, a four-poster bed rests in the center of the northern wall upon a braided rug.  Opposite, between two large windows, a painted oak armoire stands open, allowing a peek at its contents."
