    "description": [
      "This room has been decorated to resemble a tent, its walls draped with black felt to the floor, hiding the real door and walls.  The ceiling is cotton, held high at the center by a vertical pole.  A brass brazier burns at the pole's base, the smoke rising through a small hole at the very peak.  Large cushions are scattered about, their arrangement easily accommodating either lounging or sleeping."
