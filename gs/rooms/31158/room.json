      "Tufted grass and ivory sedge vie for dominance over the northern slope that has a thin game trail leading to a ring of blueberry bushes around a pair of beech trees.  Nearer, blue-green juniper bushes dapple the landscape where a gentle, yet persistent, breeze bobs the heads of black-eyed yellow daisies.  Ovoid boulders rest on the western edge, their windward sides smooth and unblemished."
