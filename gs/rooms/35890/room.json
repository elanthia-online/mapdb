      "The settlement's clan hall stands proudly in the middle of a large rock garden filled with smooth pink, blue, grey, white, and black stones of different sizes.  Dark glaes statues of dwarves holding myriad crafting tools decorate a carved stone path leading to the hall's glaes-framed entrance.  A clustered treeline almost completely encircles the area, broken only by a short stone bridge that traverses a quickly moving stream to the south."
