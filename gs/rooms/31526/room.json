      "Wall-to-ceiling shelves of rich mahogany boast gold-framed glass cases, the containers intermingled with various relics and antiques angled across the darkly lacquered wood.  A map-covered driftwood desk dominates the back of the room, flanked on the left side by stacks of ledgers and volumes of aged leather, a horizontal glass bottle nestled atop the pile.  To the right, a tall ironwood-carved kraken engulfs a battle-marred galleon, the sculpture's tentacles wrapped around the rooted desk."
