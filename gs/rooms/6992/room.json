      "You are standing on the edge of a high plateau which stretches far to the south from here.  To the north, a sheer cliff of several hundred feet drops to the floor of a vast forest below.  From your vantage point high above the forest canopy, the forest seems to stretch in a great unbroken sea which crashes into the cliff below."
