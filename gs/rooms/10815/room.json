      "Worn away by rain and the underground action of continual water, the road has sunk to swamp level.  At this point, though, it remains firm enough for passage and rises slightly out of the swamp to the west.  To the east the road disappears entirely under black water for twenty yards or so then emerges again to proceed unsteadily on its way.  Continuing east is most likely a sink or swim proposition, and perhaps both."
