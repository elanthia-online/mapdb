      "Colorful ribbons in a dazzling display of silver, blue, gold, and red loop over and around all of the tent's dark oak posts.  The black walls of the tent are embroidered with a series of bright multihued fireworks exploding amid a backdrop of stars.  A wild-eyed halfling sits beneath a series of netting in the corner, while building a pinata."
