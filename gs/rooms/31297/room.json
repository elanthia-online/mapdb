      "The trees here are spaced far enough apart that the grass has grown long to either side of the path, and pockets of it have encroached into the trail itself, where it has been trampled flat by pedestrians.  A steady trickle of shoppers wend their way through, stopping occasionally to peruse the wares of one shop or another, or to greet an acquaintance.  The low hum of conversation is pleasant and mixes in with the occasional twitter of birds from the treetops above."
