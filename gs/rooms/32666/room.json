      "The roughly hewn obsidian walls and floor are a stark contrast to the polished finish of the rest of the tower.  Ornate sconces, lit from within by tall beeswax candles, adorn the walls at even intervals, their orange and red light flickering and dancing across the walls beneath the shadowed ceiling.  Two gnarled ebonwood trees flank a blackened display case and a crude shelf formed from rock jutting from the wall, while a pair of mannequins stand at attention on either side of the room."
