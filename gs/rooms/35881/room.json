      "The angular interior of this building is crafted from carved sections of wood and stone, comprised of short hallways adjoining a row of six workrooms to this chamber.  A vaulted ceiling curves upward from each of the glaes-framed archways that mark the entrance to each workroom, forming a wooden dome that is carved in bas-relief with emblems of various flora and fauna.  Each emblem is arranged within one of many concentric circles, centered around a Ragnak Clan crest at the ceiling's concave apex."
