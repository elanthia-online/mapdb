      "Grafted to the wall with heavy iron brackets is an enormous whale bone that has been carved in the sailor's style of scrimshaw.  Heavy footlockers, mostly the type used by sailors, are arranged through the niche and though the padlocks are still in place, the sides have been chewed out by some kind of large rodent."
