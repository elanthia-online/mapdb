      "Uninhabited bird cages of assorted shapes and sizes dangle precariously overhead by varying lengths of frayed twine.  Stacked one atop another, colorfully painted birdhouses sit vacant in one corner of the canvas-draped tent, while a row of empty coops are lined up along a rickety counter.  A speckled, bright blue egg has pride of place snuggled in a large nest atop a glass display case."
