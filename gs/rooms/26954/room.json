      "Concentric bands of alternating cobalt, alabaster, and crimson-hued bricks spread outward from a shallow broad-basined fountain, the carefully crafted rings artistically blending with the various pathways that wend their way through the gardens.  Golden mirrors fitted with fitfully burning votives are positioned at various intervals within the foliage, the moonlight playing off of the prisms positioned before them.  Two wrought iron tables provide refreshments, while red geode benches offer space for repose."
