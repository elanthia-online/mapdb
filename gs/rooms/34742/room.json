      "Daylight filters in through brightly colored windows of stained glass, awakening rosy hues in the marble statues lining the walk.  One sculpture, that of a beautiful man clad in sheer robes, is given pride of place atop a tall pedestal, but all of the statuary depicts beings of preternatural beauty.  Most are twined in chains about the wrists and neck."
