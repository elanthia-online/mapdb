      "Pulled taut against dark rosewood support beams are layers of creamy tan canvas.  There is a triangular peak at the top of the yurt that expands to form its bulbous, circular body.  Mats of woven bamboo line the floor, while stained glass-shelled lanterns dangle high above.  Opposite a slit opening in the canvas walls and pressed back against the room is a long rosewood worktable full of colorful merchandise."
