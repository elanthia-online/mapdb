      "Shredded tapestries, the victim of some rodent, hang in long lengths from the walls, their once resplendent threads now dingy and mildewed.  Painted roses decorate the spaces between, though each bloom is chipped where the paint has peeled away.  Pushed against one wall, a glass and brass display case holds court over dust bunnies and bluebird feathers."
