      "A small path winds sinuously away from the muddy road, forking to head to the temple to the south, or behind the fence that marks the eastern edge of the graveyard.  Several wooden planks are missing from the fence, offering a fair view of the dark stones and small mounds that adorn the other side.  Several small homes line the opposite portion of the road, many of which are in pristine condition."
