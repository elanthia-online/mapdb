      "This spacious room is well lit by the numerous torches hung on every wall.  A sturdy dwarf mannequin stands near a pair of glass doors, as if appreciating the shop's selection of merchandise.  A dwarven shop clerk stands behind a glass display case, which is situated in the center of the room next to a gift-wrapping table.  A tall weapons rack has been bolted to the back wall, far from the more fragile of the shop's wares, including a narrow glass shelf which stands near a short glaes archway leading to the museum's lobby."
