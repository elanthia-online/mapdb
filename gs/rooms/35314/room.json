      "Dark, polished stone from Teras darkens the surrounding white marble, creating an imposing yet refined atmosphere.  Behind the heavy, iron-banded desk sits a grizzled dwarven debt collector, his beard as braided as the intricate carvings on the desk.  A massive iron safe with ornate gold details dominates one corner, its face emblazoned with monikers of the Borthuum Company and Kharam Dzu.  On the opposite wall, a tapestry illustrates the long journey from Teras Isle to Ornath, featuring ships navigating treacherous seas."
