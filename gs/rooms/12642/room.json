      "This room is where the fire seems to have done the most damage.  Only the great size of this room prevents it from being impassable as the remnants of chairs, benches, and wall tapestries line the floor.  Even the decorative armor that lined the walls has been turned mostly to a slag of metal by the great heat generated by the fire."
