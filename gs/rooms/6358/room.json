      "Pale blue carpet covers the floor in this tidy little office.  Wooden models of buildings crowd the surface of a stained oak cabinet that is nestled between two plant stands.  Resting on the corner of the polished oak desk is a glass oil lamp.  The flame of the lamp dances across neatly stacked papers which are bound by a thin cord on the desk."
