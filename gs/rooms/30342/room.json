      "The interior of the shop has been reinforced by lacquered oak planks, the wood framed by circular recesses and knotwork-carved shelves displaying stacks of wares.  Long banners of richly dyed silks and wool line the available wall space, their designs echoed upon the braid-edged rush baskets set upon the hard ground."
