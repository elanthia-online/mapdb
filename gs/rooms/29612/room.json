      "Light fog dances through the area, diffusing the light from a colony of small magelights strung along the cloud-painted ceiling.  Arches to the south and west counterbalance the large, open vista of the rooftop to the northeast.  A small marble walkway spans the ten foot distance to the rooftop, sans railings or supports.  One mistwood bridge heads to the east, while a similar bridge leads north."
