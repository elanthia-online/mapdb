      "The faint, resinous scent of balsam hangs in the air, intermittently overpowering the aroma of rustic loaves of bread baking.  Opposite an ivy-besieged transept, a stout brick cooking hearth holds court, serving double duty as the sole source of warmth in the otherwise chilly refectory.  A lone tanik bench spans the length of one wall, providing the only seating in the slate-tiled assembly room."
