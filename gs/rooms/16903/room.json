      "The only furniture in this tiny room is a tall-backed granite chair behind a smooth granite desk.  Displayed upon the wall is a pick-and-shovel insignia.  Practically covering the entire surface of the desk is the Zul Logoth citizenship book.  Closer inspection of the book reveals thousands of pages listing the names of the dwarven citizens of Zul Logoth, as well as the names of those of other races to whom the town has awarded partial citizenship. The toadstool in the corner provides the only illumination in the room."
