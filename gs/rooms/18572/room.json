      "All four walls are painted a pale, spring lavender and the floor is completely covered with a plush cream-hued rug.  Beneath a wood-framed pastoral painting rests a fluffy feather bed, which is covered with homespun linens.  At the end of the bed, an oaken sea chest takes up residence, while on the far wall an antique mahogany armoire sits beside a set of darkly stained wooden shelves."
