      "Polished white stone countertops laden with copper cookware are fitted along three sides of this room.  A wide copper vent extends from the ceiling, ending above a large fire pit and roasting spit.  Above the counters are shelves neatly filled with silver and gold serving trays, tea sets, plates, and goblets.  The center of the fourth wall is occupied by a small oak door, flanked on either side by wooden hooks hung with heavy linen aprons."
