      "Beneath the shelter of the walls flourish banks of sweetbriar, their petals like rubies in the dimness.  The perfume of the resplendent blossoms lingers on the air, heavy and saccharine.  At a join in the walls, a basalt guard tower climbs high into the air, gargoyles and grotesques lending their hideous grace to perches up its dark stone facade."
