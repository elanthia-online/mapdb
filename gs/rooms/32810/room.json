      "Crafted from thick lengths of heavy black leather, the tent's edges sway slightly.  A varnished wooden desk is set near the back, with evenly stacked sheets of vellum organized neatly upon it.  A rune-etched circular stone table dominates the center of the pavilion, bordered by several wooden stools.  Wisps of yellow, green, and cyan smoke curl up from crystal beakers that continuously bubble within a rhimar-lined rack."
