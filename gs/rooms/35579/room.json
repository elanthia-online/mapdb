      "Shale shelves jut from the cavern walls, layered one atop another like a rough staircase swallowed by time.  Turtle grass blankets the floor in thick, rippling mats, shifting with each faint current.  Pale streams of light pierce the ceiling, scattering across the shale and catching flashes of movement as hermit crabs scuttle from shelf to shelf.  A polished nacre mirror hangs against a shallow ledge, while a barnacle-encrusted shell-shaped sign rests among the grass, its carved letters softened by passing tides."
