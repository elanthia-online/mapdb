      "Dusty shelves line the walls, their surfaces crowded with lit candles that send wavering light into the dim corners.  Cobwebs drape the upper reaches and trail between shelf supports, their fine strands glimmering in the glow.  An aged witchwood rocking chair sits near a pair of benches pushed to one side, their wooden seats polished by years of use.  Beside the exit, a curl-topped large orange jack-o-lantern with a broad, goofy grin rests on the floor as if standing guard."
