      "Heaps of coin, jewelry, and other spoils clutter the chamber in gleaming profusion, casting dazzling reflections of the torchlight illuminating the arched hall.  More spills from huge chests of bloodwood and redsteel, themselves supported by piles of treasure.  Standing imperiously over the trove is the statue of a massively muscled man in black marble, his callused hands clenching twin scimitars.  Steps proceed upward through a hammered black steel arch at the far end of the chamber."
