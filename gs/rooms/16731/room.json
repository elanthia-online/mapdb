      "[Wall of the Ravine]"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Rising from below is the sound of the rushing river, its roar echoing through the ravine.  Dangling over the ledge is the end of a thin hemp rope leading upward that hangs from high above.  It sways back and forth in the wind which gusts through the narrow confines of the ravine.  Scrub brush clings to the wall of the ravine, much of it brown and light olive green, and providing perches for the occasional small bird or curious rodent.  From here, the ravine floor is only a jump away."
