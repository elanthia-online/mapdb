      "A colossal tree, uprooted long ago, lies sprawled dramatically across the sand, its twisted roots clawing skyward in silent protest.  The trunk, worn smooth and drained of color by the elements and harsh sun, forms a natural barrier dividing beach from jungle.  Fragments of coral and fantastical shells cluster beneath the fallen giant, and tiny wildflowers bloom courageously in the rich earth along its landward face."
