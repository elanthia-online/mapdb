      "High-reaching trees claim their domain in the dense wilderness, the canopy of leaf-laden branches allowing only narrow shafts of moonlight to penetrate the dense haze of mist.  The muted light barely breaks the oppressive shadows of night enshrouding the closed morning glories that cling to the trees, weighing down the smaller branches until they droop solemnly toward the rich soil.  Fungi and rotting leaves keep each other company in the dark, occasionally joined by a cluster of pallid moonflowers.",
      "High-reaching trees claim their domain in the dense wilderness environment, the canopy of leaf-laden branches allowing very little to penetrate the dense haze of mist.  Dappled light gives vision to the morning glory vines taking their toll on each one, their thick presence weighing down smaller branches until they droop solemnly towards the rich soil.  Fungi and rotting leaves keep each other company in the dim shadows, occasionally joined by a cluster of exotic flowers."
