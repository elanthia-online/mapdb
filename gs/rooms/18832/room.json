      "Spongy and slightly squishy, the grass-blanketed depression that was once an old creek bed still holds a bit more moisture than surrounding land.  Purple loosestrife and blue-violet pickerel rush have sprung up in spots, amid flowering cattails and bullrush.  Crickets seem to favor the location with their cacaphony."
