      "The entire back wall of this utilitarian room is covered with wooden shelving to form a latticework of pigeonholes for mail.  Each of the side walls holds a similar set of shelves, though the openings are larger, some almost ample enough to accommodate an average-sized dwarf.  Separating the sparsely furnished reception area from the bustling activity of the mail center is a tall slate-topped counter.  Smaller display cases topped with thick glass bracket the entryway."
