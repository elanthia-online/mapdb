      "A gentle sea-breeze blows through the white linen curtains that cover a large window in one wall.  Directly across from the window is a large canopy bed.  In the corner stands a double-door wardrobe closet made of imported dark mahogany.  On the opposite wall you notice a large vanity with an oval mirror and a plush velvet bench.  To the right of the fireplace is a plush loveseat and in a corner of the room, a dressing curtain."
