      "Appearing larger in the northern sky, the fiery radiance of Tilaok dominates the landscape with its orangish-red brilliance as the celestial body reaches its azimuth.  A jewel-toned aurora shimmers above and stretches towards the fierce flaming sphere in the heavens, but it quickly transitions to a sanguine hue as it gains in proximity.  So, too, does the energy field that protects the golden tile-lined pathway, which is interrupted by a glowing glass-lined ring."
