      "Wood-framed sketches of local fauna decorate the vine-covered walls of the room, the drawings framing several vividly colored flowers in a soil-filled wide clay jar resting on a small wooden stool.  A pyrographed black willow chest sits open before a leaf-etched mirror, the celestial-decorated container filled with various pieces of clothing and small knickknacks cradled within the quilted interior.  A pudgy grey dormouse darts in and out of each component of the shop, gazing in curiosity before disappearing back behind a vellum-paneled partition."
