      "Dagger-sharp switchbacks climb toward the city atop the unforgiving plateau, the basalt walls casting long shadows over the road.  Veins of obsidian thread through the dark, porous rock, the volcanic glass glinting coldly in the starlight.  Near the lip of the plateau, the roadway is paved with wide dark stones and winds toward the gates of the city."
