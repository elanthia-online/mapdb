      "The bustling atmosphere of the market intermixes with the relaxing sound of water bubbling from a lion-carved stone fountain.  Vendors push carts up and down the cobblestone road, stopping occasionally to demonstrate their goods or to make a sale.  The intoxicating aroma of coffee permeates the area, originating from the direction of one of the establishments."
