      "Rich grey-toned walls encompass the men's suite while midnight blue carpeting stretches across the entire floor.  A ring of high-backed chairs occupies the middle of the room with wooden drink stands positioned between each seat.  From behind a marble countertop, a burly human man greets guests while smoke trails up from his thick cigar."
