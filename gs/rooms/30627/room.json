      "Surrounded by a cast iron chain railing, the rounded chamber is lined with whitewashed paneling.  Looking over the metal barrier is a circular opening that allows a view of the bottom level of the lighthouse.  Set into the wall is a pale blue door and a light beige door, their painted, wooden surfaces protected with a clear lacquer."
