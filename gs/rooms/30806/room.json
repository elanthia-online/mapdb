      "A woodworking masterpiece, a wooden wheel is positioned behind a polished teak binnacle, the housing for the ship's compass, with a capstan bringing up the rear of the deck at the ship's helm.  A cabin girl slips out of a wooden door carrying a tray weighed down with with a gleaming silver tea service, and a few cookie crumbs are all that remain on the empty saucers.  The sound of the ship's bell signals the next watch change."
