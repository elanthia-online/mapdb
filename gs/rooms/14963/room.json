      "The wooden pier extends to the north, set on heavy stone pilings rooted in the riverbank.  Merchant barges are berthed along the pier, loading and unloading a variety of crates and barrels.  A group of gaily dressed workmen bustle around a large canvas tent, which seems to be in the process of being taken down or put up."
