      "Starlight filters through the intricately carved pillars, casting a gentle, silver radiance on the grey-veined marble floor of the tholos.  Built into the curving eastern wall of the inner sanctuary and almost touching the terracotta ceiling, an illuminated floor-to-ceiling alcove houses a carved stone statue of Gosaena.  A small, banded altar of gneiss rests at the statue's bare feet."
