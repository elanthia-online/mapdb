      "Torches and toadstools alike have been placed around this meeting room in order to keep it well lit.  In each corner of the room rests a set of polished iron armor upon a stand, and expertly forged shields hang along the far wall.  A long, broad table covered with documents rises from the floor in the center of the room.  A large oak chair stands at the head of the table, while several shorter stone chairs have been neatly arranged along the sides."
