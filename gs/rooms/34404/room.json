      "Floor-to-ceiling windows have tops fitted with stained glass in bright red and copper hues, while the shutters that flank them are open to allow the salt-laden sea breezes to trickle in.  Opposite the windows and across the rug-covered floors, a double wide archway provides egress into the Great Hall.  Eastern and western bookcases provide a variety of wares for sale, the shelves watched over by an apprentice."
