      "A pale stone weapons rack at the gallery's western end appears to be mostly ornamental in function.  The weapons on it have a look of great age, their hafts and handles worn as smooth as glass, but their blades are oiled and sharp in a display of obvious care.  Silver-fringed banners in black, teal, and a variety of other colors boast an assemblage of heraldic sigils, but a dark blue banner emblazoned with a rampant mule is given pride of place."
