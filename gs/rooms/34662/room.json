      "Trophies of the hunt hang from mounting boards on the slate walls of the restaurant alongside spears and bows that have the appearance of great age.  Serving staff bustle around tables and booths, carrying gold-chased silver platters laden with delicacies.  Through the melange of dishes, the savory aromas of roasting venison and garlic win through, but they are only a few of the tantalizing aromas promised by the kitchens.  Some glass-paneled doors lead out onto the patio, where more seating is available."
