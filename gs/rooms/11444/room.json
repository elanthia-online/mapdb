      "The foam-flecked waters of Maelstrom Bay stretch out in all directions.  The broad green line of a cliff curves from the east to the northeast.  A low coral reef rises above the wide, rolling swells to the west.  The spray from the swells slapping against the reef is a ghostly white in the moonlight.",
