      "Shallow tidepools dot the sand, their crystal clear depths harboring tiny fish and colorful anemones that bloom like underwater flowers.  Jagged volcanic rocks frame some of the pools, edges softened by downy blankets of bright green sea moss.  Occasional gusts drive curtains of salty spray across the beach, the brine mingling with the scents of blooming tropical flowers drifting down from the jungle atop the cliffs to the east."
