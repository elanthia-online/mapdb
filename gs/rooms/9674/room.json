      "Silky runners blanket the smooth wooden floor, as sunlight streams in through circular skylights.  Standing forefront of the entrance is a small waiting area complete with a cushy circular bench ringing a ceramic planter bursting with delightful blossoms.  Sheer drapes curtain off the adjacent rooms, providing privacy to patrons as their innate beauty is brought to the surface, refined, and then polished.",
      "Scented votives float in water-filled crystal bowls, casting a gentle illumination over the surrounding area.  Standing forefront of the entrance is a small waiting area complete with a cushy circular bench ringing a ceramic planter bursting with delightful blossoms.  Sheer drapes curtain off the adjacent rooms, providing privacy to patrons as their innate beauty is brought to the surface, refined, and then polished."
