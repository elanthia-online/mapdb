      "A rough-and-tumble pub stands at a bend in the road.  Smaller and dingier than the more successful establishments to either side, the bar's clientele are mostly bedecked in the crimson and cerulean of the quartermaster's office or the black and azure of the Czag Dubra's fighting company.  Grizzled and scarred, they crowd the pub's booths, filling the air with a riot of jeers and laughter."
