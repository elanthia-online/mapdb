      "This side of the tree platform ends here in an open, rounded area.  Set along the south side of the platform is a circular riser elevated to the level of the railing, providing a precarious perch for those wishing to take in the view at this height.  Tied off on one side of the railing are several lengths of rope that can be seen climbing up into higher tree branches overhead.",

Set along the south side of the platform is a circular riser elevated to the level of the railing, providing a precarious perch for those wishing to take in the view at this height.  Tied off on one side of the railing are several lengths of rope that can be seen climbing up into higher tree branches overhead.  A small wooden structure juts out from the decking suspended over the ground below by supports attached to the side of the trunk."
