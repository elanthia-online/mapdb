      "The fragmented remnants of a fallen cavern wall skirt the edges of a tapered path with an austere, stony backdrop.  Hanging gilded lanterns cast a warm glow from beneath the variegated awnings that line a narrow-laned bazaar full of vibrant and engaging storefronts.  Floating intermittently on the swirling breeze, the smoky aroma of burning cedarwood punctuates the crisp chill in the air."
