      "A jumble of tattered sails, shipwrecked trunks, and barnacle-robed planks lie half-buried in the silken sand, souvenirs scavenged from long-forgotten sunken vessels.  A brittle, salt-worn ratline is secured against a towering wall of fire coral, its vertical and horizontal strands creating a haphazard network for rusty hooks to display a bevy of goods.  Nearby, a weathered ship's wheel leans lazily against a whip coral, its rosy tendrils curling around the handles like the fingers of a ghostly captain navigating a course."
