      "Cramped and lit only by one small lantern with dingy glaes panes, the storage area is stacked with crates, boxes, and overturned casks.  Rope hammocks swing from the overhead, no longer beds for the crew, but filled with a variety of arms.  A row of ports on the starboard side are filled with dirt rather than sky due to the angle of the sunken airship."
