      "Arduous and exhausting, the trail is a lesson in patience no matter which direction is traveled.  Unyielding weather conditions and strenuous terrain leave trail-goers completely exposed without any options for shelter at this midway point of the trail.  A quick glimpse of the surrounding area shows the trail all the way from the current location to the pathway's landing -- it looks much like a boot."
