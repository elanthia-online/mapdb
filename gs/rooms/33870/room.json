      "Triangular particolored flags of sailcloth and silk drape off gradual lengths of rope above a duo of stone-arched doors, the entryway curtained in veils of vert heartleaf.  Tall recesses carved into the stucco walls are filled with tiny nielira-shaped votives, the blush-colored wax painted with an ombre of pale blues and greens, each votive resting on a nacreous oyster shell.  Interspersed between the alcoves are fluted clay pots, the saffron-painted containers erupting with verdant ferns."
