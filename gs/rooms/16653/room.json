      "A tattered merchant permit hangs on one of the white silk-paneled walls, and an uneven wooden ceiling rises overhead.  Some puffed raw silk pillows sits in one corner of a swirled sea glass floor.  There is some stained driftwood shelves on one side of the shop and a long mistwood counter on the other."
