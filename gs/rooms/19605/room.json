      "Cradled against a cliff facing is a brilliant white silk pavilion, its peak blindingly bright in the sunlight.  Tiny pockets in the surrounding walls hold small nests which local birds flit to and from as they sing their carefree tune.  The warm, salty air is tickled with an off-shore breeze that is laden with the heady fragrance of roses.",
      "Cradled against a cliff facing is a brilliant white silk pavilion, its peak glittering in the silvery moonlight.  Fireflies cavort in the shelter of the wall, their jeweled wings casting a prismatic spray upon the white sands of the beach, while the cool, salty air is tickled with an off-shore breeze that is laden with the heady fragrance of roses."
