    "description": [
      "Dark green ivy has been painted along the edges of the pure white walls, twining about each other in a gentle embrace upon the low ceiling.  A small pool bubbling with wisps of steam is set in the middle of the room, and a small wooden bench padded with verdant green leather is propped up against the wall next to it.  Rich, celadon-hued velvet drapes across a small russet wooden table, and a few pots filled with dark oils rest atop it."
