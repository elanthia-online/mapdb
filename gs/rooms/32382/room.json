    ],
    "description": [
      "Despite the bitter cold of the windswept shores, life flourishes in a shallow tidepool near the water's edge.  Framed by jagged blocks of banded shale, the pool is clear, its water occasionally refreshed by the onslaught of the tide at its height.  Beneath the surface, jewel-toned blue crabs shuffle about on beds of algae, accompanied by pale white clams and black mussels."
