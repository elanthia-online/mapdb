      "Perched near the stone-littered top of a small incline, the clearing descends to the west into a grassy expanse that ambles away from the burbling stream.  Painting the pale green grass in orange, white, and yellow hues are the remains of hundreds of pumpkins, their vine-topped heads and curved sides scattered about as if a great battle was waged by the vegetable.  At the top of the clearing, a hefty korrigan stands within a field of bright orange pumpkins marked by a seed-covered bright orange sign."
