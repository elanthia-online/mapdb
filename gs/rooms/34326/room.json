      "Winds on the western edge of Thunder Plateau are stronger than those elsewhere, and the proximity of lightning strikes are much closer.  Chilled raindrops pelt endlessly against anything in their path and leave a trail of muddy concoctions between non-touching stones.  Downy barbs of powder blue mixed with clumps of sandy blonde fur are strewn across the ground, indicative of recent combat."
