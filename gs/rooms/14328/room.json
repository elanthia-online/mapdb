      "The soft light from the room's only candle gives the chamber an intimate feel as it illuminates the polished white oak walls and floors.  A fine pattern of seashells has been intricately carved across the northern wall.  Sitting in the corner is a large modwir bed fitted with sea-blue linens and a sandy-hued quilt patterned with leaping fish across its surface."
