      "The game trail widens into a shrouded path that meanders up to some snowy trees to the northwest, the stand of close-growing pines obscuring the trailway from the forest beyond.  Several bone fetishes are woven with twine around the boughs of the conifers.  The bones are sourced mostly from birds and small rodents, but there are a few larger ones that might be humanoid among them."
