      "Perched upon the edge of a decline to the north, blue shale and pink feldspar boulders dapple the landscape upon a carpet of dark green sheet moss.  Green-tipped astrantia nod their elegant heads from amid their thrones of shiny palmate leaves, yet despite their elegance the air is darkened by their less than savory fragrance.  Slipping and sliding down the cliff face is a series of thin rivulets fed by the ice above."
