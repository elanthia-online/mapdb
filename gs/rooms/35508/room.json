      "Several silk ribbon-hung mirrors line the walls of the haon-framed wagon, the geometric shapes etched in a melange of flora and fauna.  A duo of pale marble statues flank either side of a silk-padded jadewood display, their outstretched arms decorated in garlands of jewel-toned naefira interspersed in verdant leaves."
