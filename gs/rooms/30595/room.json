      "Warm wind rushes through the area in a constant cyclone, carrying with it the floral scents of each corner of Elanthia, all blending with the smell of ozone.  Eight gently pointed alcoves, spaced like the points of a star, spread out from this center room, each one painted a different hue.  A large black directional sign takes up residence in the center of the white marble floor, its bold white writing standing out against the dark background."
