      "The tunnel threads its way through a series of rock columns.  Each is carved in the image of a tree trunk, with finely rendered bark, branches and an impossibly complex pattern of leaves overhead.  The trunks are majestic, their silence made more noticeable for lack of bird song and the breath of wind moving through their boughs."
