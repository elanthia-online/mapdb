      "Stretching across the floor is a cerulean silk rug displaying a woven map of Kraken's Fall and its surroundings.  Training Administrator Caelisa sits behind an immense ironwood desk, which is centered in front of an extensive bow window.  Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves occupy all available wall space, each shelf containing perfectly shelved books, tomes, and scrolls.  A pair of wingback chairs with intricately scrolled arms and legs flank a pale stone arch."
