      "Blazing torches light a tunnel with a high ceiling as it delves down into the cold earth.  Walls of carved rock have been worn smooth by centuries of use, and their natural striations are accompanied by paintings of man and beast engaged in bloodsport.  To the east, the tunnel dead ends into a foundation wall that is being dismantled by the encroachment of roots, which have partially dislodged a crooked stone."
