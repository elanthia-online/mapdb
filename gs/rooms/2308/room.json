      "The street ends in an ivy-covered building.  Restorative herbs grow in the window boxes, perfuming the icy air with their pungent aromas.  A polished modwir sign hangs from the roof of the building, suspended by bright gold chains twined with creeping vines.  Geckos no longer than a halfling's finger cling to the vines, catching insects happily.  At the side of the shop, some empty wooden buckets are filled with dirt.  Several varieties of coldleaf tobacco flourish in the makeshift planters.",
      "The street ends in an ivy-covered building.  Small herb gardens grow in the window boxes, tickling your nose with pungent aromas.  A small wooden sign hangs from the roof of the building, suspended by bright gold chains twined with creeping vines.  Geckos no bigger than your little toe crawl through the vines, catching insects happily.  At the side of the shop, some empty paint buckets have been filled with dirt, and several varieties of hardy young plant grow within."
