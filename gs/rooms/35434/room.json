    "description": [
      "Smooth white plaster walls enclose the alcove, where an arched opening reveals a sweeping view of the distant harbor.  The floor is adorned with a mosaic of small ceramic tiles in cobalt blue, pale seafoam green, and white, their patterns forming flowing waves that echo the maritime vista.  A wrought iron-framed sign is mounted on the wall, its bold lettering welcoming visitors to the island.  Overhead, the open sky stretches unobstructed, adding to the airy atmosphere of the alcove."
