      "Lighter blue walls offset thick royal blue carpeting.  Upon one wall is a mural depicting a beautiful seashore scene with a sun setting over a sea as seen from a white sand beach.  The bed and chairs in the room are covered in royal blue velvet.  The table seems to be made entirely of mithril."
