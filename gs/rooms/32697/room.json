      "Deep black granite tiles are cornered with cabochons of pure blue lapis, and a detailed mosaic of a peacock with fully spread fan dominates the center of the floor.  Dozens of gilt-framed portraits of past Illistim rulers decorate the dark panelled walls, a testament to the longevity of the House."
