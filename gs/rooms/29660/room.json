      "The spacious structure is draped in a pale-colored cordetum fabric that is faintly illuminated by a number of sturdy iron lanterns strewn about the area.  At the center, a rectangular white oak counter divides the space, separating a carved wooden cabinet from a gold-banded thanot chest.  A row of silver mithril racks sits in a tidy line against the back wall, flanked by a number of forging hammers ornamentally displayed in glass cases.  Diverging from the simply austere ambiance, the delicate, flowery scent of daisies lingers faintly in the air."
