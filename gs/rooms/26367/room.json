      "A large sofa surrounded by smaller dark leather chairs fills the space in front of a rustic stone fireplace.  Pale crystal globes hang from dark silver chains, their muted light gently illuminating the dark paneled walls and thick burgundy carpeting.  A polished walnut dart board painted with alternating burgundy and ebon sections hangs above a small woven basket of sticks.  Draped with an elegant topaz-threaded runner, a sideboard is covered with a variety of refreshments.  A dartboard rack rests next to a large curtained archway."
