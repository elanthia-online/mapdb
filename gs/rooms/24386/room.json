      "A tiny stream flows through the forest of roots from the massive oak tree, the glimmering waters forming a small pool amid a circle of grey rocks.  Small wildflowers grow in between the gaps of the rocks, and the deep blackness of the pool is broken only by the faint ripples of the stream from above.  The hanging moss is particularly thick here, providing an intimate, tranquil atmosphere."
