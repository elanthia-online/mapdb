      "Tall foliage-covered walls form the perimeter of the shop, each partition decorated with vibrant flowers crafted of vellum and silk.  The filigree-painted center of the room is covered by a tiered display of enamel teacups, the tiny ceramic containers posed in haphazard positions and held aloft by thin strands of ribbon-wrapped wires.  Several butterfly-shaped lanterns hang from the crosshatched ceiling, forged from blown glass, the diminutive figures casting rays of colorful light across the room."
