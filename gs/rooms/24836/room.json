      "Dry-cured hams hang from the ceiling of the wagon on numerous steel hooks.  A multitude of splatters and stains cover the thick tanik planking of the wagon's floor.  Sharpened imflass knives are mounted on the wall in a row of ascending sizes.  A large stove is positioned directly under a hole in the roof of the wagon."
