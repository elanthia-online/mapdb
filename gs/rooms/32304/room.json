      "Two paths, one northern and the other southern, converge to from a wide dirt road that plunges between two hills as it descends toward the west.  Here and there are signs of old habitation: patches of gravel and cobblestone that have been lost over the years, leaving behind only denuded dirt.  The hillocks are crowned with patches of blue iceblossom, and the gold-tipped flowers sway gently in the breeze coming off the river."
