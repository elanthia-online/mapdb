      "Broad driftwood beams, lashed together with lengths of dried seaweed that has been braided into a strong and flexible rope, stretch out over turquoise blue waters.  Anchored to warped old posts by heavy iron rings, salvaged anchor chains hold corroded lanterns aloft to creak in the ocean breeze.  Abandoned crates and overturned barrels leave little navigable space on the weathered wood of the docks."
