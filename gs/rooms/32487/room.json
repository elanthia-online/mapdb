      "Barrels of wine occupy wrought iron racks that travel from floor to ceiling in the frigid cellar.  A silvery layer of dust clings to even the newest barrel, a cask of syrah from Talador.  Shelves along the eastern wall are home to glinting bottles of rarer vintages, the glass's colors ranging from deep red to gentle green."
