      "Thick fog roils through this wooded area of the swamp, obscuring potential pitfalls for secure footing.  Strung up between some dead branches is a bright banner tied with equally colorful streamers at its ends.  A battered human pinata hangs high up on a nearby tupelo tree.  Leading back to the rest of the festival is a long muddy path."
