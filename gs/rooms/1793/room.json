      "A stone chimney, built of small mica-flecked granite blocks, juts out of the ground at a drunken angle.  Piles of debris are mounded before the opening of the chimney's firebox.  The wooden walls of the original structure, burned to the ground from the looks of things, have nearly rotted away completely."
