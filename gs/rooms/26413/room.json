      "Most of this expansive deck is navigable, save a large cypress mast mid-deck and its accompanying lanyards and mast stays.  A brass railing encircling the main deck of the vessel provides sufficient viewing space for those wishing to gaze out upon the waters.  A decorative, nautical motif is inlaid along the edges of the smooth teak planking underfoot."
