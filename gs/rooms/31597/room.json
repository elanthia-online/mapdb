      "Occupying the entire upper level of the manse, the study is both expansively lit by candles and surrounded in scarf-wrapped polished glass windows that offer ample natural lighting.  Ebonwood bookcases line every bit of the walls that aren't occupied by a window, while dark walnut tables are arranged in the center and surrounded by oiled leather armchairs.  Smaller, more private nooks can be seen to the east and west of a flight of mahogany stairs that lead to the lower level."
