      "Coral formations cluster across the cavern floor, rising in layered ridges and spirals.  A smooth stone ledge juts out above, running along one wall with a clear view of the space below.  Near the far end, a slender crevice splits the rock, its interior obscured by shadow and drifting silt.  Water moves slowly through the chamber, stirring strands of algae and casting shifting patterns across the walls."
