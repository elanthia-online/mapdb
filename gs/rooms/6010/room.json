      "This narrow, dusty path wends its way along the scraggly, untended trees.  Wild sprigs of Imaera's Lace poke their pale heads up above the blades of grass that grow along the border of the walkway, the white flowers highlighted in silver by the moonlight.  The sickly sweet scent of over-ripened grapes is born on a slight breeze.",
