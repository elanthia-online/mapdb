      "A couple of large umbrella plants force the path to wind and turn back on itself.  Nearby, a host of smaller plants of the same variety stand in a group, as if watching their bigger brethren commandeer the trail.  A log juts out from under one of the pair, its deteriorating trunk playing host to a score of bright, red-speckled mushrooms.  They look like tiny fairie-folk peeking out from beneath the gigantic parasol-shaped leaves."
