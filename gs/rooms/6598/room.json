    "description": [
      "This hall is in a decrepit condition.  Large holes deface its exterior walls, granting a glimpse of one of the eastern towers.  The doorway leading to the inner yard is doorless and bereft of its ornamental carving.  The entrance to a residential chamber opens to the west, while a hall to the southwest grants entry into a corner tower.  To the northeast, the hall veers, making it difficult to tell what lies in that direction."
