      "The scent of earthen pigments and dyes hangs heavy in the air of this part of the cabin, and a thin gold-threaded curtain blocks further depths of the space from view.  Counters hug the walls, and atop them are a rope-handled wooden crate, an oversized silver vase, and a woven rectangular basket.  On the wall above the basket, a black-inked parchment sign is securely mounted."
