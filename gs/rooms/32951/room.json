      "Torches mounted to the walls flare above a tall maple counter built on a wooden platform that covers the floor.  Upright racks line the wall behind the counter, organizing some finished planks.  Neat bundles of sticks lay next to stacks of logs nearby that are tagged and ready for sale.  A wood handle rises from the bit of an axe that's been hacked into a short upright standing log behind the counter."
