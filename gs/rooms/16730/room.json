      "The constant dull roar of water echoes loudly, drowning out all ambient sound.  Past flooding is evidenced by faint high water marks on the ravine walls, which rise high above both banks of the fast-moving river.  Aside from debris washed up on the river bank, only scraggly scrub brush has survived to flourish in the immediate area."
