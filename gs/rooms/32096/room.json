      "Hanging from the walls and strewn across the floor are various sketches of elaborately drawn widgets and simple machines.  A small lamp casts light that dances off the metal gears and sprockets piled on the large work table in the center of the room.  Some mismatched couches and cushions are squeezed into the small space."
