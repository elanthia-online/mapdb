      "Piled into a corner, a variety of brick-a-brack clogs the passage and fills the air with a musty scent mixed with rot and saltwater.  Tarnished copper mirrors scattered throughout the pile catch available light and reflect it towards both the north and the west, extinguishing any requirement for candles in the immediate area."
