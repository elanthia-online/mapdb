      "Contrasting pale marble floors, six blue-grey pillars support the crescent-shaped room's domed ceiling off the rotunda.  The center of the study contains a large granadillo desk and a plush plum divan set upon a round crimson rug just beyond.  Wheeled haon ladders set on either side of a bronze peacock-faced fireplace afford access to the room's tiered art displays and bookshelves.  Smooth white marble ledges afford a view of the gently gurgling fountain in the gallery below, following the crescented wall toward a rounded wrought-iron door in the corner."
