      "A coat of pure white paint adorns the walls, reflecting the soft illumination of golden candelabras placed at the four corners of the chamber.  Fragrant smoke flows out of an invar-wrought censer suspended by a thick chain from the center of the ceiling.  Holy relics are beautifully displayed on shelves protected by clear glaes.  A massive anvil sits atop four solid stone blocks and has been draped with a richly embroidered cloth to serve as a counter."
