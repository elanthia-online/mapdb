      "This corner of the court is dominated by a round marble fountain.  A few solitary elves sit on the wide edge of the fountain, occasionally tossing a coin inside and murmuring a wish, as they steal shy glances around them.  The water descends from a tall center column, producing a musical burble that softens the noise of the city's daily traffic.",
      "This corner of the court is dominated by a round marble fountain.  A few couples stroll hand-in-hand around the wide edge, occasionally stopping to toss a coin inside and murmur a wish, as they look lovingly into each others' eyes.  The water descends from a tall center column, producing a musical burble that obscures the lovers' words.",
      "The cobblestoned court gives way for a circular fountain, whose edges are repurposed into a wide ledge of tiled seating.  Nearby, the marble facades of several shops look on, forming a ring around the open plaza."
