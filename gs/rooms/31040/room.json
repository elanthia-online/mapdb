      "The walls are lined with dresses and gowns hanging from curved silver hooks set into the onyx-swirled white marble.  A well-dressed seamstress stands behind a wide marble counter with an order book on it.  Overhead, a large crystal chandelier casts its radiance over several impeccably dressed mannequins.  Two fragrant potted gardenias frame the curved arch leading back to the concourse."
