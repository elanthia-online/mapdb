      "Tumorous growths defile the vines hanging overhead and cascading down the walls, adding to the blighted, sickly appearance they have developed from growing down in the dark.  The wood plank path bends eastward with the curve of a sheer rock wall that serves as the grotto's boundary.  Sculpted bodies, humanoid and at turns nubile and virile, are carved into the rock in a veritable bacchanal of intertwining forms."
