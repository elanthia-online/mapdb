      "The broad sweep of the dark oak floor is interrupted by a well-armed stocky warrior statue.  Halfway to the white stucco ceiling, a tattered merchant permit hangs on one of the rough white stucco walls.  A plank-covered barrel table and a plain wooden table are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
