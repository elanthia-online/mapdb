      "The practice room's decor is spare, with only a chair, small side table and music stand for furnishings.  Overhead, the blades of a ceiling fan make a soft swish as they turn.  Facing the door is a single window offering a view of the brightly lit Aerie Pub in another wing of the Hall.  And just past that, one can glimpse the sparkle of moonlight shining on the deep indigo blue of the ocean."
