      "Several wire-framed mannequins are displayed along the flora-draped mahogany walls of the small shop, the forms decorated in pale-colored gowns and tunics crafted from fine silks and brocades.  A ceiling-high glass display dominates the center of the room, the various tiers framed by long ribbon-knotted garlands of origami doves and hearts dunked in bright glitter."
