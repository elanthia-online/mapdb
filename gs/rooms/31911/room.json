      "An umber velvet curtain opens into a small workroom; a set of workbenches pushed to one side for ease of use.  A latticework chair sits before a small desk, its thin legs marking lines in the wooden shavings that cover the floor.  Tucked beside the desk, an assortment of papers has haphazardly stuffed into a haon box."
