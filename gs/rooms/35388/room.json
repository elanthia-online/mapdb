      "Nestled between towering evergreens, stone tiles stretch beneath a canopy of shifting green.  A long firepit, its edges blackened with age, sits at the center, where a sturdy iron spit hangs over the embers.  A low granite counter curves along one side, its surface smooth and cool, scattered with wooden boards and empty clay bowls.  To the south, an arch of bougainvillea provides access to another cooking area, while opposite, a cascade of rambling roses drapes over a northern patio entrance."
