      "This large, cubic room serves as the entryway into the building. Tiled entirely in black marble, it seems smaller than its actual size.  An open space leads back outside and a high arch leads east, further into the building.  Over the arch, carved into the dark marble, is a design formed of several geometrical shapes entwined together in a complicated, interlocking pattern."
