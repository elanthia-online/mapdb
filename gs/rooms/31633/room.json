      "Large cobbled stones plastered with stucco form the walls of this windowless room, while thick iron bars create a barrier between the common area and that of the detention area.  Rough wooden benches form a loose waiting area in front of a baluster-surrounded counter where moldy and dust-covered papers are stacked in orderly piles.  Stretching along the eastern wall, a set of stairs rises to towards the second floor but sharply turns towards the north as it disappears around a corner."
