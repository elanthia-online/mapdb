    ],
    "description": [
      "Rising sharply, the land climbs to a narrow peak, with a few trees rooted close to the sheer cliff that leads straight down into the golden red glow that limns the long crest of the orchard itself.  Directly below, no details are discernable aside from the curious illumination, but a glance up and outward offers an ideal view of the Bittermere Woods and the curl of river that snakes between them and the orchard ridge."
