      "Along the southern verge of the fane's rooftop plaza, an enormous obsidian altar is framed by two tall runestones of feldspar and volcanic rock.  Shriveled viscera still drape it, desiccated to the point of mummification by the dry and icy air.  A pool of blood fills a crescent depression cradling the rear of the altar, frothing and sloshing as if alive."
