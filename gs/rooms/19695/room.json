      "This is apparently the entrance to an area that has been mined.  Small amounts of ore can still be seen in the walls.  It has been sculpted to best display the twists and turns of the parent rock.  The Gnolls always leave these small traces of ore in place as tribute to the Mountain Father and this simple, yet appropriate, homage to their deity is beautiful to observe."
