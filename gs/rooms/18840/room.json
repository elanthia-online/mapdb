      "Sloping from clifftop to shore, the dirt path becomes slightly more treacherous with the addition of thousands of rocks and smaller stones.  River water washes the smoothed ovals, sending up a constant susurrus that gently soothes.  The occasional swarm of miniscule gnats buzzes nearby with an annoying whine.",
      "Sloping from clifftop to shore, the dirt path becomes slightly more treacherous with the addition of thousands of rocks and smaller stones.  River water washes the smoothed ovals, casting a temporarily glistening sheen over each with every tiny wave.  Slender shadowy fish dart close, hovering near the sandy bottom, while searching for a winged snack."
