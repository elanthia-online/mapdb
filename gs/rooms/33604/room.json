      "Gaps have formed in the hedge where branches have been damaged from lost maze wanderers trying to push through the foliage.  Small holes through the bushes show the other side of the hedge leading down a different path.   A large spiderweb, the sunlight shimmering off its strands, has been woven within the foliage."
