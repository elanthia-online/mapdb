      "Elaborately wrought statues guard the perimeter of the vestibule, set before a series of vibrant woven tapestries.  Giant luminescent toadstools have been arranged carefully at the heart of the chamber, casting their soft light upon the stoic faces of the statuary.  Suspended from the ceiling is a simple crimson banner embroidered in golden thread."
