      "Surrounded by stonework, the exit is framed in dark mahogany with a slightly curved lintel.  The adjoining walls are covered in pristine white plaster, while the ceiling has exposed rafters that support golden linden paneling.  Flanked by floor-to-ceiling windows that provide a view of the arctic landscape beyond, an enormous cobblestone fireplace spreads heat through the open space, dispelling any chill that that tries to invade the domicile."
