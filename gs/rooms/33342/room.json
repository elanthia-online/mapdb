      "Painted on the hard stone floor is an archaic symbol, its presence unmarred by fire damage originating from its edge.  Similarly, the stone walls bear scorch marks up to the ceiling, with a heavy concentration of soot in the corners.  A damaged tapestry hangs on one side, its length wavering slightly despite a lack of wind.  Suspended from the ceiling on a rusted iron chain is a rectangular oil lantern, its glass panes either severely cracked or missing altogether."
