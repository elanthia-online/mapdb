      "Rough-hewn wooden beams frame the farm stand, its slanted awning stretched taut overhead in faded tones of ochre and sage.  Loaves of fresh bread rest neatly within baskets, their crusts scored with intricate patterns, while a nearby counter is covered in dishes and jars filled with marmalade or chutney.  Beneath the counter, burlap sacks filled with grain lean against the stand's sturdy supports, their coarse fabric marked with trade sigils."
