      "Centered in the area, a bright blue dunking booth is surrounded by a collection of tables heaped with stacks of stitched hide balls.  The majority of the booth is made up of a massive tank filled with murky water.  High above the water is a bucket, which can only be reached by way of a slick wet ladder, and positioned to the side of that is a red-painted target.  Several petite women mill about the area, obviously keeping watch over the game and a small ticket collection barrel with a large sign leaning up against it."
