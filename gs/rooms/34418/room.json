      "Glaes-veined prismatic crystal chimes hang from the ceiling by thin silver chains, their rainbow-hued striations reflecting the steady light of a central lantern in a shifting, multihued display of colors across every surface in this quaint shop.  Lustrous songstones and jewelry are presented in a velvet-lined, tiered display case along the slightly curved wall, facing an arched passageway to the south."
