      "Perched atop a small rise in the grassy meadow is a magnificent flowering linden tree.  Its delicate golden blossoms drift in the air, scenting the breeze with a faint fragrance.  A thick bed of pink and purple anemone surrounds the base.  Resting under the canopy is a small bench crafted from grey stone.  Tiny carvings of woodland creatures adorn the sides."
