    "description": [
      "Concentric bands of onyx and white tiles encircle an enruned shadowglass obelisk that sits in the center of the garden.  Tufted and manicured blue-green grasses form a small lawn around the tiles before giving way to large and small urns filled with flowering bushes and ornamental shrubs.  Smooth marble benches are arranged at various points throughout the small garden, each flanked by pebble-filled glossy ebonwood planters housing a variety of orchids.  A small patio rests before the manor, offering firm footing before a set of glass-paned doors."
