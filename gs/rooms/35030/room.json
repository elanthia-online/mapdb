      "A narrow thread of solid ground winds close to the shores of a lake of lava.  Superheated smoke rises in choking billows from the slowly churning expanse, stinking of sulphur and molten metal.  Tiny islands of igneous rock dot the surface, but cracks of lava seethe between them, threatening their brief span of stability."
