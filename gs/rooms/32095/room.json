      "A barnacle-covered tapestry stretches across the back wall of this cramped office, partially covering the polished wooden wall underneath.  A wide claw-footed desk takes up most of the space, while an elaborately embroidered rug spreads across the floor.  The subtle scent of medicinal herbs wars with the sharp, metallic tang of blood in the still air."
