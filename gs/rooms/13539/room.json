      "This sumptuously furnished room is laid out as a half-hexagon, with the door leading back into the guildhall piercing the long, northern wall.  Directly opposite the door, a fire burns merrily in a massive fireplace framed by an extravagently carved mahogany surround.  Near the fire, a matching desk is positioned to allow its occupant to gaze through one of the two leaded-glass windows flanking the fireplace."
