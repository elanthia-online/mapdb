      "Rows of large barrels, kegs and casks lying on their side fill most of the expansive room, the wooden containers nestled into hollow, stacked stone racks.  An almost thin mist swirls close to the smooth floor, and a slight chill pervades the air.  A few dwarven workers wander around the storage area, checking on the various stock."
