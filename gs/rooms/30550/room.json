      "Draperies of gauzy white silk enclose the room, swaying gently in a slight draft.  A detailed circle of runes dominates the center of the floor, worked in pearlescent white tile amongst the greater pattern of wispy cloud patterns.  Tightly rolled sheaves of paper peek out from small niches in the numerous scroll racks that line the silk-covered walls."
