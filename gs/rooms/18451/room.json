      "As the road takes a turn northward, this curve is left without the clutter of buildings, and the view into the pasture beyond the split-rail fence bordering the town is left unobstructed.  On the other side of the fence, a herd of cows mill about idly, some munching on bits of grass, while others have settled on the ground beneath one of the few trees that dot the landscape."
