      "Nestled within a depression near the inner wall of the rim, an ethereal garden of bioluminescent fungi flourishes.  Ghostly blues and greens cascade from the pallid mushrooms like a waterfall of gentle light, their surreal glow illuminating the path.  Their tiny spores dance by on the cavern's wild air currents, looking like phantasmal embers.  The surrounding ground is carpeted with bulbous growths of mold and is spongy underfoot."
