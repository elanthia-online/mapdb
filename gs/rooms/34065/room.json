      "A rounded niche at the end of the hallway features a mural of monumental size that depicts a chaotic battle.  Draconic figures clash with vile beings of glittering shadow, their war sprawling across a burning sky.  The stones of the near wall are newer than their neighbors, their edges not yet smoothed by the passage of centuries."
