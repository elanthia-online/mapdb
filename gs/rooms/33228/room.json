      "A charging mule seal is picked out in mosaic tiles on the floor of the armory, worn by time and the passage of many feet.  A short, blocky desk of carved modwir guards the area before a riveted heavy steel door, kept meticulously free of dust and debris.  Lanterns suspended from the ceiling are unlit, but the smell of lamp oil lends a sweetly tart fragrance to the air."
