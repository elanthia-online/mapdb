      "The spacious work chamber is lit by a number of candles in festive colors, each encompassed by a faceted crystal globe.  The dancing light gleams off of the edges of hay-lined crates full of various materials and pools on the surfaces of silky cushions scattered in a rough semicircle across the floor.  Bright tapestries soften the cold stone of the walls, featuring artistic cavalry scenes and forested splendor."
