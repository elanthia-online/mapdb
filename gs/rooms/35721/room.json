    "description": [
      "Constructed from interwoven branches and dried vines, the hut smells strongly of dried herbs and musky incense.  Bundles of roots and plants hang from carved wooden hooks anchored to the thatched roof, and crude shelves support clay vessels and wooden bowls containing aromatic pastes and tinctures.  The floor, strewn with dried leaf litter, is gritty with spilled powders and tacky with tracked-in sap that has captured a number of glinting feathers."
