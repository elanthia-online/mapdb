      "The wide intersection is well-traveled by horses, wagons, and people alike, those on foot dodging metal-shod hooves and toe-crushing wheels.  Alongside the muddy thoroughfare, dandelions bloom beneath a shield-shaped sign tacked to a wooden pole.  Free of the detritus created by both four-footed and two-footed traffic, a grass-edged narrow dirt track winds a sinuous path up a hill covered in crystalline structures of snow and bristle-head black alpine sedge.",
