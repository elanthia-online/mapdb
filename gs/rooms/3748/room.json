      "Hardly larger than an ample closet, this stone-walled room serves as the armory for the prison guards.  Lining one wall is a large rack filled with various polearms and a smaller, more elaborate rack holding an assortment of swords of obvious elven make.  A rack of axes, both fantastical and functional, rests near a set of heavy brass-bound oak doors.  The weapons are held in the racks by thick iron bars, each secured with a large lock.  Chain shirts and shields hang from hooks on the walls, serving as martial wallpaper."
