      "Decorated with small, intricate patterns, the western wall holds carved decorations, while the eastern houses a large niche.  Rising solemn and alone at the heart of the room, a beautifully carved stone statue is ringed by glass-shielded candles that bathe it in a gentle, greyish light.  Twin staircases, one leading up and one leading down, are the only exits from the chamber."
