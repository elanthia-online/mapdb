      "Fine damask upholstery covers the many matching chairs gathered in a semi-circle in the center of this mahogany paneled room.  Several scrollworked wrought iron stands hold musical scores on thick sheaves of parchment.  A large golden harp rests near a low red velvet hassock, a carved scene of sailing vessels and frolicking sea nymphs worked across its base.  Lyres, mandolins and other fine instruments rest in glass covered displays spaced throughout the room."
