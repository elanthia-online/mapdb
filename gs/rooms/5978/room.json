      "A high-pitched barking resonates from somewhere within the dark orchard, but its exact origin is cloaked by the long shadows cast by the pale moonlight.  A slight gust of air drives the yellow-tipped grass blades into motion, the tufts waving frantically for a moment before becoming still once again.  As the gust passes, a low musty odor wafts through the air.",

A slight gust of air drives the yellow-tipped grass blades into motion, the tufts waving frantically for a moment before becoming still once again.  As the gust passes, a low musty odor wafts through the air."
