      "White silk-paneled walls rise from a colorful mosaic floor.  Just above a colorful seashell collection hangs a silken sea-themed tapestry, and a sturdy bamboo-rafter ceiling completes the picture.  A cedar and oak footlocker and a floral-etched ceramic case stand side by side in the middle of the room."
