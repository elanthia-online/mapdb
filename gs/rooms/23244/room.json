      "Overstuffed armchairs, upholstered with painted silk, and a matching settee form a conversation area in the corner of the room.  Set well off the rug, chairs surrounded by the accoutrements of weapon, shield and armor care, offer a place to repair items in comfort.  Aligned on the south wall, a buffet table frames one side of a vaulted archway that opens on to the entry hall.  The great rug on the hardwood floor muffles footfalls, and the atmosphere lends itself to a temporary respite from outside troubles."
