      "A magnificent grey stone manor with a crested cornerstone rises into view, light dancing in its windows.  Thick arrays of ivy climb the ancient walls, framing an elegant bronze plaque and a set of tall arched doors.  Flanking the main building, twin towers rise gracefully, providing a striking balance and harmony to the view.  Cushioned silver benches are scattered about the paved courtyard in pools of light shed by wrought iron lamposts.  A high stone wall with an ornate silver gate circles the property."
