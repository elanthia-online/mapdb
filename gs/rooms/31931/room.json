      "Grey tones wash the neighborhood with a persistent dreariness and dull the pastels of burgeoning blossoms adorning every home.  Like a fluffy, ashen pink cloud floating at the base of the hill, flowering cherry trees separate the houses from tiered rows of buildings rising to a distant peak.  Glowing pale orange windows break the gloom of their cinereous facades.  A half-timbered stucco shop with a steeply pitched roof sits at an angle at the corner of the bifurcated, cobblestone street."
