      "Nestled behind a thick curtain of ivy, this small space is cool and inviting.  Several silver lanterns hang from the branches above, illuminating the room with a warm glow.  Along the back wall are a row of wooden pegs and a large oval knothole.  The floor is covered in a thick layer of leaves that fill the space with a fresh, earthy scent.  A carved wooden sign hangs next to several depressions carved into one side wall, creating a series of shelves."
