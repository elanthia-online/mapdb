      "A faded crimson banner bearing the hotel crest hangs limply from a decorative iron railing enclosing the narrow walkway.  Visible through the black bars, a downspout sculpted into a birdlike gargoyle claws its way out of the surrounding grey stone.  Several lichen-encrusted wood shingles have slipped from the steep gable roof and lay scattered in the courtyard far below."
