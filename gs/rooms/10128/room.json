      "A spindly-limbed tree rises up from the dark mire, its skeletal branches clawing at the sky.  Green moss hangs down from some of the stronger branches of the tree, giving the illusion of life long since stripped away.  The long trails of moss sway hypnotically as stray currents of wind brush by them, their wavering green forms a stark contrast to the bleak, dead surroundings."
