      "Silence permeates the long corridor, and shadows restlessly flicker along the black-speckled white tile that stretches down the hallway.  Artwork created by the students hangs neatly on the walls, the only testament that someone comes here.",
      "The sound of children fills this portion of the hallway, the noise drifting out of the classrooms as well as from those darting along the corridor.  The black-speckled white tile continues here, adding an echoing quality to the narrow egress, and artwork created by the students hangs neatly on the walls."
