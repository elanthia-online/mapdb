    "description": [
      "Partially enclosed by pale stone walls glinting with fingers of frost, the garden is shielded from much of the adjacent town center's din.  Bright winter roses in a splendor of frigid hues scale the walls in profusion, their thorny stems green despite a tracery of silvery rime.  At the center of the close stands a blue and white pavilion, its mule-printed pennants languidly waving in the breeze.  Near to the entrance, modwir bench sits by the entrance of a recessed shrine."
