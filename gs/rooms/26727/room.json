      "Recessed into the porous walls, a small fire cheerily parts the gloom of the cavern and sends its grey smoke up through a chimney fashioned of cracked stalagmites.  Smooth stones, some large enough to sit upon, dot the area, while fish bones gleam bright white in the dark.  A large rhimar-lined chest stands ready to use by local fishermen."
