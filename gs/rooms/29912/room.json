      "Acrid fumes belch forth from the open windows of a huge hut with hides stretched across drying racks in the surrounding yard.  Bear and wolf pelts commingle with hides that are vivid blue and heavily scaled.  A worktable sits next to the tall doorway of the home, and a skinning knife with a blade nearly the length of a falchion's is jammed, blade first, into the wood."
