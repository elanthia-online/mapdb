      "Hundreds of glassy eyes stare out from the dagger-like stalactites looming high above the chamber, the bats' compact bodies flickering in and out of view with the dwindling flame of a low-set torch.  As the light grows, the number of visible bats lessens, the sound of flapping wings growing closer and louder when visibility begins to wane."
