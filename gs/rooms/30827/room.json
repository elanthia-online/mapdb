      "The sea encroaches about the dark sand edging the pathway, each swirl of water unsettling loose sand to review glimmering runes upon an indeterminate surface.  In the distance, the atoll rises from the waters, an imposing jewel in the ocean's crown.",
      "Dark sand leads up to a pile of rocks, offering a somewhat safe passage ahead.  Glowing runes are visible just beneath the edge of the path, and the atoll in the distance continues to grow in size as the path wends closer."
