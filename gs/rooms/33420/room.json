      "Resembling a manicured lawn, the outcropping is sheltered by the cliffs of Kraken's Fall on the west and encircled by a white picket fence on the north and east.  An octagonal picnic table and a driftwood bench are scattered about the area, while an open-air kitchen is built directly against the cliff face.  A large blazing bonfire surrounded by stones and sand is the focal point of the plain, while a rickety sun-faded staircase leads to the beach below."
