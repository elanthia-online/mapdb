      "Large mounds of what can only be called junk are haphazardly strewn around the interior of this shop, and the areas of floor which remain visible are covered with multicolored stains of various hues.  A narrow window sits high up on one wall, though it is so heavily encrusted with greasy soot that it only provides meager illumination at best.  Pitted bronze hooks are strewn around the walls at irregular heights and intervals."
