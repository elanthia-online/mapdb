      "The road curves as it rises over the mound of a low hill that is little more than a large bump in the road.  Thumps, clangs, clatters and the shouts of workmen can be heard from the warehouses to the west.  Crows roost on the thatched and shingled roofs of the cottages, squawking at passing residents."
