      "The entry to House Brigatta is panelled and floored in dark oak.  An ornately carved table sits to one side with a small crystal vase standing upon it beneath a brightly polished silver mirror.  On the west wall, a series of shelves and pegs hold various cloaks and garb for the outer world.  To the east, a stairway heads up to the second floor.",

An ornately carved table sits to one side with a small crystal vase standing upon it beneath a brightly polished silver mirror.  Across the room, a series of shelves and pegs holds various cold weather cloaks and garb for the outer world as well as bits and pieces of battle stained armor.",
