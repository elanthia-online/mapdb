      "A mural engulfs the surface of the northern wall, bending with the curves of the stone to embrace the raised dais.  It depicts a twisted form of snatching claws, gnashing teeth, and grasping tentacles, sprawling outward from one massive eye with a star-shaped pupil.  An altar of pocked ebon stone sprouts twisting appendages that hold aloft a globe of quivering urnon.  No candles illuminate the chamber, but a large indigo sphere hangs from the ceiling, casting fitful radiance on the surroundings."
