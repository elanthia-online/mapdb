      "Dense clusters of hibiscus and ginger line a narrow footpath, their vibrant blooms standing out against deep green leaves.  Clumps of calathea and monstera fill the spaces between the flowers, creating layers of tropical greenery.  Twisted pandanus trees flank a tall latticework archway before spreading out to mark the edges of the clearing, their stilt-like roots forming natural barriers along a seashell path."
