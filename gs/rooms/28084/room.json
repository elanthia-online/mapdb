      "Merrily decorated with miniature woodworked cutouts of knight, castle, sword, and shield models coated in garishly shimmering paint, the space is crowded but also bright and lively.  Small wooden pens and roofless barns sized at a low height are spread over the ground, each populated with lifeless mechanical toy equines and roltons, though a handful gallop around, respectively neighing and bleating plaintively and occasionally running into the sides of the pen, barn, and one another.",
