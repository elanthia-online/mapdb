      "Woven with strands of muted golds and greens, a beautiful ramie silk carpet leads down the hallway from a carved tanik archway.  A bright, potted geranium rests next to a gold-banded lapis velvet curtain that hangs opposite a green and silver chevron-patterned curtain.  A small, stained glass skylight showers the room with patterns in brilliant hues as sunlight shines through the colored panes."
