      "Brass rods anchored to the white marble walls support long swathes of emerald green Vornavian silk, the unfettered ends pooling upon the polished floors.  A massive chandelier hovers over the space, illuminating the various teller counters fashioned of golden linden and carved with elegant swans with splayed wings.  An enterprising employee has roughly carved an orange-red lobster into the lower left corner of one counter, its claws open at the regal bird's webbed feet.  Beyond the counters is a mural."
