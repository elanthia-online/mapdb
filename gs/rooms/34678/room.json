      "Guarded by a high counter of jewel-inlaid walnut, an elaborate gold and steel lockbox holds a pile of silver, gold, and copper coins.  The tools of a jewelcrafter's trade hang from a rack of the same fine wood, hammers, chisels, tongs, and hand drills all maintained with painstaking care.  A worktable beneath the rack houses a pair of lathes.  Though clean, the wood of the table glints with gem dust in the light streaming through the windows."
