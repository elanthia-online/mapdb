      "The golvern-edged propellers of the ship shine in the sunlight, casting a wavering blur of reflected radiance over the smooth-worn and polished planes of wood below.  Fanciful tracery forms golden vines up the trio of cylindrical supports leading up to the whirring blades.  A burled cherrywood hatch fastened with a black iron ring lies at the center of a hollow formed by the supports."
