      "Heartleaf-engulfed fountains of chiseled marble are affixed to either side of an ivory-washed stucco building, their androgynous forms gazing up at their ivy-cradled palms.  Behind the thin glass is a display of oiled wood mannequins, the curvaceous frames swathed in couture of silk and velvet, then embellished in richly colored jewels.  The iron-forged balcony above spills curtains of unfurling naefira towards the grey cobblestones, the petals scattered across the crystalline waters."
