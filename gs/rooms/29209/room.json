    "description": [
      "Flanked by two prominently displayed torches, the wide opening of a water-slicked cave looms large atop a rocky promontory.  To the east, an expansive view of the whitecapped ocean stretches toward the horizon.  The thunderous crashing of waves against the shoreline drowns out all but the loudest of sounds from the nearby town and the piers in the distance.  Overhead, gulls cry out and scan the surroundings in search of an easy meal."
