      "Rippled stone around the southwest tunnel mouth gives way to the organic folds and striations of a natural cavern.  Shallow, meandering pools stretch further into the vault, churned silt clouding the blue-green water nearest their elevated edges.  Tendrils of warm mist rise from the water's surface and fill the air with a complex melange of odorous fumes.  Rosy eggs, fogged over by the heat, spill from cavities and clefts in the walls and gather in the pools, cohering in gently undulating mats."
