      "A street sign stands half buried in a riverbank, its wooden vanes pointing the way to Whirlaway Lane to the northwest and to the continuations of Roundabout Way to the northeast and south.  Small rock pathways lead up to the front doors of houses, many doorways bearing seasonal decorations for upcoming and past festivities."
