      "A mix of boats from peapod and square-sterned skiffs to broad-beamed fishing cutters lie on either side of the road, most of them resting keel upward.  Although an aged wall encloses her workyard east of the thoroughfare, the boatwright has a portable workbench set up between Tidewater and the bay and is engrossed in repairing several sprung strakes in the hull of a small pinnace by the light of several lanterns.",
