      "A large banner is suspended from the ceiling just inside the archway, boasting an assortment of hand-drawn quills and ribbon-tied scrolls surrounding the title \"Elanthian News Delivery Through The Ages.\"  Lush carpeting quiets the octagonal room, each wall featuring a display centered upon its smoothly plastered expanse.  High above, domed stained glass in jewel tones depicts a messenger bird coming to rest upon a twining grapevine.  A large, round rich blue leather bench provides a welcome spot to rest."
