      "A windswept fall of leaves creates a soft cushion over the brick path that winds its way through the high supple grass growing in this open corner of the garden.  An apple tree crowds up against the furthest wall, its leafy branches spreading up and out over the stacked-stone wall that separates the garden from the surrounding woods. Through the screen of branches can be seen a darkened niche set back into the furthest corner of the wall.",
