    "description": [
      "The path here is coated with dry, brown needles fallen from coniferous trees.  Tall modwirs, firs, and pines ascend to the sky, as the occasional aspen flickers its colorful leaves.  The air is filled with the whispering of wind passing through high, needle-laden branches, and the sound of running water comes from nearby.  Sticking out from behind one of the tree trunks is what looks like a large brown ear."
