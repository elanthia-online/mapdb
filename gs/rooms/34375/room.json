    "description": [
      "With even the most careful of steps, the bridge sways back and forth in a precarious manner, creaking and groaning as if it could surrender to its shoddy condition at any moment.  Worn smooth after excessive use, the ropes used for handholds bear an unfortunate side effect of the excessive humidity:  a chalky, dark green mold.  Splintered sections of wood detach from the structure's main slats with a distressing crack, similar to that of a bone breaking."
