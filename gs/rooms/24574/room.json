      "Huge steps have been carved into the stone wall of the cavern forming a stairway of gigantic proportions.  No creature that you have ever seen has had the size or length of leg to negotiate stairs of this size.  Looking out over the cavern far below, you can see tall spires of stone that look like small splinters of rock from this distance."
