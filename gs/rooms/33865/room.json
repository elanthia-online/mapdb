      "Lattice-woven walls of leafy flora frame an open-air stall, the angled partitions affixed with shallow terracotta pots occupied by several honeybees darting between the vessels.  Gilded chairs and tables are scattered across the wide paved road, the metal seating wrought into the shapes of several nautical creatures.  Curling tendrils of heartleaf cling to wire-caged baskets suspended from the sunbleached stone buildings flanking the stall, the ivy providing a temporary perch for several curious avians."
