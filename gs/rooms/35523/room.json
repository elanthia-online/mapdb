      "Encrusted with skeletal fans, jagged antlers, and clustered nodules in hues of crimson, frost blue, and ivory, the walls of the cavern are bright with coral formations.  Glassthread vines descend in long, hair-thin tendrils, curling across sediment and rock.  The strands shimmer where currents bend them partially covering a slender crevice.  Between ridges and ledges, a variety of sea creatures move about, finding shelter in the natural artistry."
