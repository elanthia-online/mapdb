      "The woodland area is framed by a copse of trees in various stages of maturity, the leaf-scattered ground beneath the forms encircled by verdant undergrowth traversing toward the faenor gate.  A mahogany-planked cabin stands nestled between the arboreal sentinels, its elongated roof sheltering a blackboard set before a series of iron-legged stools.  Several makeshift workbenches are set beneath the towering branches, covered in a variety of well-worn tools."
