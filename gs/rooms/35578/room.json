      "Turtle grass stretches in thick mats across the floor, each blade swaying gently with the shifting current.  Sunlight pours through cracks in the cavern ceiling, casting bands of gold and green across a smooth boulder that rises from the heart of the alcove.  Limpet shells cling to the shale walls in a patchwork of shapes and colors, their polished surfaces catching flashes of reflected light.  A polished nacre mirror rests against a low outcropping, beside a barnacle-encrusted shell-shaped sign."
