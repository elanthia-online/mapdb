      "Stretching from the southern edge of the street towards the ocean, a sprawling shipyard surrounded by a high fence and sporting large pulley-operated cranes is quiet though well-illuminated to discourage thieves.  Clustered storehouses and warehouses fill the opposite section of the street, their doors barred and chained for the night.  Thin curls of shaved wood litter the cobblestones."
