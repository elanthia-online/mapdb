      "This room is brightly decorated with summery primary colors.  A deep green carpet covers the floor, accentuated by green and white striped curtains and plain white walls.  The large four-post bed features oversized green pillows above an elaborately embroidered comforter.  An elegant crystal vase on each night table holds a small bouquet of yellow roses."
