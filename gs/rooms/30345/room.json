      "Lengths of rough driftwood, lashed together with coarse sinew, form the supports of this small lean-to.  Pieces of various species' hide are layered over the supports enclosing the space.  An iron lantern spreads a flickering light over an iron stand filled with bows of various woods and adornment."
