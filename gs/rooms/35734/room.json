      "Despite the decided cant of the deck, the merchant ship's figurehead stands undamaged.  Carved from surpassingly pale wood with a fine, silky grain, it takes the form of a rearing ki-lin with hooves outstretched.  The proud beast's mane is sheened with salt crystals and its snout is wet with spray.  Carved eyes stare out over the bounding main, serene as if undisturbed by the surrounding wreckage."
