      "Winding back and forth to avoid outcroppings of wet and slippery rocks from the splashing of the river, a tiny path leads down to a small cozy beach situated along a bend in the river.  Surrounded by three logs, the cold remains of a fire lie in a rough pit, and an unrecognizable charred bone rests upon the grey ashes mingled with bits of black charcoal."
