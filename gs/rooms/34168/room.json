      "Veins of calcite wind along the wall in shades of dark red, ochre, and mauve, lending a splash of color to the black granite.  Their surfaces are waxy and scored with scratches that suggest efforts to broaden the walls of the tunnelway.  Sinuous and winding, the underground path threads between stalagmites as tall as trees.  The tops of the rock formations are lost in the oppressive darkness."
