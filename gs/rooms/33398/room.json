      "The cavelike research area is affixed with numerous wooden shelves riveted to the stone walls, the units filled with numerous jars, alembics, and flasks crafted from various glasses and metals.  A duo of lanterns sit at the center of an ebony table, its surface scattered with stacks of parchment alongside an apparatus set beneath a citrine heating element.  Nestled in the far corner is a rack-covered station, neatly organized with cast iron tools beside a moss-encircled basin."
