      "Sparsely furnished, the small room houses a riverstone hearth in the far corner that is flanked by glass-fronted cupboards.  The curtained four-post bed occupies the far wall beside a golden linden nightstand and a faenor-banded leather footlocker.  Beneath a frosted globe chandelier, set at the center of the room, is a small, round table with two armchairs draped with cashmere blankets."
