      "Salt-stained fishing nets, in various stages of mending, cover the interior walls of the shack.  Woven throughout the lower section of each net is a series of lobsters, crabs, tuna, and other sea life, all masterfully recreated by a childlike hand.  A large piece of driftwood is mounted on the back wall and proudly displays a stuffed marlin."
