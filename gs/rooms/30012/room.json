      "A crushed stone path leads toward a wide clearing in the wood, where a village with high walls of raw timber sits along the shore of a vast frozen lake.  The way is lined with tall, spindly humanoid shapes woven from bark, feathers, and bits of clacking bone.  The ominous constructs stare down with empty eyes of jewel and stone from either side of the path."
