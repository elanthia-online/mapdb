      "Outcurved around the room, emblazoned cobalt mistwood counters gilded in copper are topped by cream slate.  Monir walls decorated with cutout trestles contain shelves and cubbies nearly overflowing with a myriad of trinkets and knickknacks.  Glass display cases and wooden racks line the opposite walls against arched floor-to-ceiling windows. Spanning the counter space, a dark-hued vaalin ladder sits on a track, allowing access to harder-to-reach goods."
