      "An ornate red bronze hatch crowns the center of the upper deck, glistening from the polished greyish wood of the planking like a jewel in the sunlight.  Spiraling wooden steps proceed down into the covered main deck, their centers worn with the passage of many feet.  A ring of etched gold surrounds the hatch."
