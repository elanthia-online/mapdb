      "Clean, white plaster walls are lit by sunlight streaming in through an airy window that overlooks the town.  All the furniture is made of a light, plain wood that has been carefully worked to show the grain.  A large bed occupies one side of the room.  The opposite wall contains a small fireplace with a black bearskin rug on the hearth, and a small painting of a mountain peak above the clouds hanging over it.  Flanking the window is a low, beautifully made wooden sword stand and a small shrine."
