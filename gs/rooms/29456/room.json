      "The room, lit by a single central brazier, is filled with the strong smell of alcohol and blood.  Faded stains that color every visible surface in shades of red hint at many failed cleanup attempts.  A well-organized collection of metal tools lies on top of a small oaken table, while a set of bronze implements hangs from the side of the brazier.  A torturer's rack is propped up against one wall."
