      "Homes of the Fisherman's Ward nestle close to the Old Ward Wall, though some enterprising individual has chipped the stone away between houses to allow for easy access to Drayhyme Way.  To the west, shop buildings in various stages of repair or remodeling are surrounded by discarded debris.  Old signs of a fire mar and darken the cobblestones near many of the structures."
