      "Banners of charcoal silk fringed in dark golden brocade hang overhead, emblazoned with a dark tower wreathed in flames in sullen sunset hues.  They ripple in air currents rising from the vast hearths that heat the cavernous chamber.  A broad runner of lush velvet in the same hues proceeds toward an arched pair of ebony double doors with leaping flames of fireleaf inlay.  Twin suits of armor, many feet too tall to be worn by a human, flank the doors, their black ora breastplates winking in the fireglow."
