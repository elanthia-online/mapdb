      "Sunlight streams through the large sections of glass set into the ceiling, glinting off brass sconces that are set into the onyx-swirled white marble of the back wall.  Centered beneath one of the skylights, and positioned to take full advantage of the natural light, is an onyx marble workbench.  An assortment of tools is neatly arranged on the small workbench including a stack of polishing cloths and a set of spectacles with convex lenses."
