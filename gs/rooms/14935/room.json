      "A small patch of moonlight peeks through the lush forest canopy overhead, creating a beam of light right at the base of an oak tree.  Dozens of wildflowers are illuminated by the beam, blooming thicker here than most other places in the forest.  Built over a wide rushing creek is a small wooden bridge.",
