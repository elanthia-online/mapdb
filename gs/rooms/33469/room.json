      "The foyer is expansive and airy, with high ceilings and polished marble floors that gleam in the bright natural light streaming in through the floor-to-ceiling windows that flank a pair of aged mahogany doors.  An imposing chandelier hangs overhead above a pair of plush leather couches set on a large wool rug near a riverstone fireplace.  Opposite the entrance, a grand staircase leads up to the second floor while an ornate oak archway leads further into the manor."
