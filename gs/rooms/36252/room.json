      "A nearly infinite number of tiny, transparent packages are systematically organized in vertical rows, covering all the available space on the walls of this cramped, narrow shop.  Framed glass cases are strategically arranged to prevent anyone from accessing the walls, each filled with a multitude of gadgets and marvels.  Dominating the center of a mottled tile floor is a group of angular steel racks that display numerous boxes painted with colorful artwork.  The smell of chemicals is overwhelming."
