    "description": [
      "Mist from Khesta 'Dahl drifts across the shoreline where a damp wooden boardwalk extends into the water, its narrow planks leading toward small fishing vessels that bob in the shifting haze.  Nearby, a line of alternating larch and birch steps climbs the hill to the south, the glow of a bonfire visible at its summit through breaks in the mist.  Established beige pathways curve around the hillock in worn, looping routes, passing the low growing fescue that rises in dense yellow-green patches along its edges."
