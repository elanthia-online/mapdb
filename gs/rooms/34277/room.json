      "Resembling a stall, the wood panel walls are supported by large posts fitted into the cobblestone street, where a series of sail-shaped canvas triangles are stretched to form a roof.  Various fabric wares are draped from a rough oak peg along the walls, while a woven marshgrass basket houses smaller items.  Though most of the shop has an open-air feel to it, there is a small, enclosed sewing room at the back that can be glimpsed beyond a large modwir door."
