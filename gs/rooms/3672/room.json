      "A magnificent bouquet of freshly cut orchids sits on a table at the center of the room.  Beneath it, an intricate mosaic depicting a scene from one of the island's gardens is inlaid upon the wood floor.  Behind a long counter stretching from wall to wall, tellers are busy helping customers.  Casually dressed guards stand at each end of the counter, quietly watching the room.  Mounted on the ceiling, a massive woven palm frond fan softly whirrs as its tiny pulleys help keep the room nice and comfortable."
