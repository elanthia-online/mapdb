      "Centered along the back wall is a polished oak desk neatly laid out with fresh parchment and a full well of ink.  A cushioned oak chair accompanies the desk, and hanging above is a portrait of an unnamed male human in a blue wizard robe and hat.  Occupying the remaining wall space are floor-to-ceiling bookshelves overflowing with books, tomes, scrolls, and parchments.  Suspended from the ceiling is a polished brass chandelier."
