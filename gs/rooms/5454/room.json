      "This area is an irrigation nexus.  Several large irrigation pools feed numerous canals and ditches that run off into the expanse of the orchard.  Small wooden dams have been placed on many of the runoff ditches allowing the farmers to send water where it is needed most.  Based on the disrepair of the system, it appears the farmers have neglected it for some time."
