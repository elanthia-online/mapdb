      "Sized for an immense stride, some cracked red stone stairs ascend to the highest reaches of the gargantuan fane, proceeding beneath a series of crumbling arches that are a deeper and more intense red than the rest of the edifice.  Chunks of stairway are missing in places, leaving a teetering array of steps at the very top.  Beyond the stairs spreads a crescent-shaped plaza dotted with banks of fresh-fallen snow."
