      "Fist-sized rocks anchor the off-white oilcloth panels of the tent's walls to the ground, preventing the subalpine breezes from invading the tent, while woolen rugs help provide additional insulation.  A long oak table displays a variety of wares and neatly bisects the space into two even aisles.  A pair of copper-edged lanterns with frosted-glass doors offers ample illumination for browsing guests."
