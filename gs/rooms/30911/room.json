      "The Counterpoint table is heavily carved and crafted of polished teak.  Across its surface, interweaving musical staffs drift in a complicated pattern resembling ribbons.  Notes dot the lines in a merry dance.  A single large nautilus shell has been converted into a lantern, which sits at the table's center."
