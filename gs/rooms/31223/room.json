      "This is a comfortable, simple bedroom.  The dominating feature is the large puffy bed set upon a carved and polished base made of modwir.  There are no other notable features except for a simple oak bookcase and a thin wool floor cover.  Tapestries adorning the walls are visible to those entering the room."
