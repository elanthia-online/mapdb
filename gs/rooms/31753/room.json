      "Decaying forms draped in formal wear shuffle to and fro, carrying various wares to their appropriate tables, each zombie readjusting its limbs between hauls.  The stone-hewn walls are covered in poorly drawn maps of various cities, some of which appear to have been torn off with teeth or marked with gore by a nearby assistant.  Loose floorboards create a semi-hazardous shop, the occasional wandering hand reaching out before being slapped down by an irritated zombie."
