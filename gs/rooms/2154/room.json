      "A steep trail winds between stark formations of glaes, frozen into grotesqueries of shapes that populate the narrow butte like strange, contorted wanderers.  Hot spits of wind push drifting clouds of steam and smoke about, carrying an undertone of salty sea-air mixed with the sulfurous stench of lava.",
      "A steep trail winds between stark formations of glaes, frozen into grotesqueries of shapes that populate the narrow butte like strange, contorted wanderers.  Hot spits of wind push drifting clouds of steam and smoke about, carrying an undertone of salty sea-air mixed with the sulfurous stench of lava.  To the south is spread a panoramic view of basalt, lava and, here and there, the ferocious beasts that thrive in such surroundings."
