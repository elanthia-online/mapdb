    "description": [
      "The grass is paler green here, as though the altitude and dearth of sunlight have stunted its growth.  Coarse mosses and lichens hug the ground and form powdery, white crusts upon the rocks scattered about.  The steepness of the slope makes you breathe heavily under the exertion of negotiating it, and you see your breath condense in vapor clouds in the crisp air."
