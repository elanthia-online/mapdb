      "Drastically unfurling from the narrow halls, the arc-shaped room expands into a sizeable foyer.  Iron-caged lanterns, each alight with a sickly green radiance, are hung strategically in the outer most corners of the area.  A pair of wall-mounted alabaster serpent heads with glinting bronzed fangs leap out from either side of a polished acacia archway."
