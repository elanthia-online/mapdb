      "Taking up a significant majority of the free space in the room, an enormous goosefeather sleighbed is mounded with oversized spruce green flannel pillows and draped with plushly layered furs.  Geometric beadwork traces the heavy suede curtains that frame a leaded glass picture window, opposite a red cedar dressing table cradling a fluted celadon wash basin.  The far wall holds a burled acacia doorway and displays an impressive collection of widely varied creature horns and antlers."
