      "Eerie multicolored light wafts from wardings carved along the high wall at the center of town.  It filters through the dark, tangled boles of strangler figs in the greenway below the fortifications.  Carts roll along the cobblestones, hauling metal ingots toward the forges of the Canton of Hammers, drawn by great black aurochs."
