    "description": [
      "Cinchona shrubs and trees of various sizes encircle the clearing amidst the towering banyan and teak trees of the surrounding jungle.  A large blazing bonfire sits at the center of the area, rough teak benches scattered about it, and several small pathways lead deeper into the dense vegetation, each marked with driftglass-inlaid teak posts.  A winding trail follows along the banks of a freshwater stream, leading upstream and beyond the nearby confluence of stream and river."
