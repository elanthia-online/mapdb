      "Trunks filled with colorful silks and low tables laden with vendibles are situated between pairs of mannequins, each positioned mid-step in various dances.  A formally-dressed mannequin sporting a luxurious blonde wig dances a waltz with a faceless partner near a tiered glass display case.  To the east, low hanging chandeliers illuminate a path through the sheer silk partitions leading to a polished hardwood dance floor."
