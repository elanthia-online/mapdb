      "Mahogany-toned wool panels form the tent's enclosure, stretched in even vertical runs that meet tightly at reinforced seams.  Carved oak supports rise at measured intervals, each post etched with knotwork patterns and narrow channel cuts that follow the grain.  An etched bronze lantern hangs from a crossbeam, its surface worked with small geometric ridges.  Burlap sacks stand in short rows, their seams whip-stitched and their open tops folded outward, with some satchels resting beside them."
