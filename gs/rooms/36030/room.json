      "Curving along the ger's western interior, the hallway arcs north before meeting the eastern passage.  White felt forms the outer wall, while the inner curve rises in blue-dyed panels marked with narrow geometric bands.  A pair of entries open into nearby inn rooms, their frames fitted cleanly into the felt-wrapped lattice.  Dark walnut planks span the floor in smooth, even lines."
