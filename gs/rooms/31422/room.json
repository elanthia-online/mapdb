      "Little more than a fishing boat, the skiff is painted bright orange and edged in glossy black.  Low seats are attached to the gunwale, three in total, at the center of the vessel, while a canvas tarp is draped across the triangular stern and bound in place by rope lashings.  A single pine mast, lateen-rigged, rises out of the boat, its bright purple and yellow sail safely furled and lashed in place."
