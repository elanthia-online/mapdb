      "Gazing over a small pond, the pathways split in a multitude of directions with some rising to the south and others descending in a vaguely northerly direction.  Dwarf pampas grass with its showy, white flower plumes sways gently at the slightest passage of wind, animal, or guest, its bright green blades fanning outward to touch upon small, manicured grasses in the intervening lanes.  A coral-hued butterfly weed trickles westward as it plays host to a variety of lepidopterans."
