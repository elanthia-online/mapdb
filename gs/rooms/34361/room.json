      "Dark, silvery bits of stone in the thin strip of sand circumscribing the island glint in the bright flashes of lightning that streak across the sky.  The aggressively lapping lake shifts them, always pulling some back into the water but returning others.  A softly glowing hemisphere of dark blue zorchar rests on the ground, perfectly aligned with one of the obsidian spires of the ring at the center of the island."
