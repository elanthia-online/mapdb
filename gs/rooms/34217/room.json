      "Striking veins of pale minerals cut through the russet outer wall of the natural rock gallery, thinning to glinting filaments near the ground.  The stony arteries form forking patterns that look like bolts of lightning striking, their natural beauty at odds with the grotesque growths of slime mold creeping to occlude them.  As if standing guard at the base of the wall, a stuffed dog made from tattered felt sits forgotten, dirty but otherwise unharmed."
