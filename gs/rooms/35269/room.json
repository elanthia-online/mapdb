      "Weathered, charcoal grey planks stretch across the pier, supported by white travertine columns.  Scattered along the dock are small barrels filled with fresh water, their lids secured tightly to prevent spillage.  The soft murmur of the ocean is punctuated by the occasional cry of seabirds."
