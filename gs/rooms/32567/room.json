      "Painted a deep red hue, the facade of a miniature barn obscures most of the cart it's nailed to, save for the hint of wooden wheels visible along the bottom edge.  Immovable doors, crossed with pristine white boards, flank a wide opening occupied by a yarn-stuffed metal trough festooned with a garland of mismatched knit socks."
