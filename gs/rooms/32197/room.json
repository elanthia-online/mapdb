    "description": [
      "Wide vertical stripes of alternating teal and saffron climb the canvas walls of the tent to the roof, sharply ascending to the apexes of the two king poles raising it to lofty heights.  A rectangular platform painted in gilt occupies a place of prominence opposite the entrance, elevated slightly above the packed earth floor to give an audience seated on the magpie collection of chairs and benches an excellent view of the entertainment.  The scent of buttered popcorn emanates from a bear-painted gnomish contraption standing just inside a tent flap framed in multihued bunches of fruit-shaped glass lamps."
