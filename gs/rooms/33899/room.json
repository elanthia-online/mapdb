      "Alternating slats of ebony and haon frame the ceiling-high windows of the shop, the corners framed by rope-bound terracotta pots spilling verdant foliage across the limestone walls.  Twin marble pillars are overlaid by a sheet of naefira-carved glass, creating an elongated counter beside a tall faenor display showcasing several samples of wares.  A tiered chandelier of stained glass hangs above the shop, casting rays of polychromatic color across the woven wool rugs dispersed across the floor."
