      "The footpath winds toward the end of the promontory and the edifice that oversees it.  Built from rough-hewn blocks of stone, the lighthouse at the promontory's end is pocked from years of assault from the salt-laden wind.  It looms over the waters far below, a cold monument over a colder shore."
