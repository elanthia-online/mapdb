      "Gutters and channels in the floor form a gruesome arcane pattern.  They radiate outward from a flat black stone that is several feet high and roughly the length of a tall humanoid.  Overhead, the zealous countenance of a faintly scaled elf stares down, his crimson eyes burning with merciless fascination.  Red and violet asps intertwine along the borders of the ceiling painting."
