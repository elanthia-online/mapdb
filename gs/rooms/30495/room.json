      "Spacious and bright, the great room has been furnished with suede-covered seating tooled with a delicate green feather pattern.  Set inside a shallow recess along the northern wall is a peridot-inlaid door, while the west side has a glossy green door.  The golden bamboo floor has been inset with diamonds patterns wrought from maoral.  Suspended from the tall ceiling is an enormous wrought iron chandelier with green coral details, upon which numerous glass votives have been placed."
