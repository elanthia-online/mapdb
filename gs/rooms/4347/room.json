      "You are standing on the eastern shore of the Locksmehr River at the point where it rushes out of the great river gates of Wehnimer's Landing.  The twin guard towers that protect the gates rise far above the beach, perhaps as much as fifty feet above the level of the water.  The heavy sea gates that span the river have been magnificently crafted so that they can be closed quickly and easily to prevent unwanted intrusions by seafaring craft."
