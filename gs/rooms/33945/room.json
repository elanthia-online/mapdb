      "The crooked construction of the hide walls of this shelter makes this space closed and cramped.  A wide wooden work table carved with a plethora of wild animals on the legs, its surface covered in bits of paper and tools, takes up one entire wall.  Shoved into the opposite corner are a wood-framed chest paneled with various skins and a hide-sided box, their interiors full with wares.  A ragged curtain constructed from several squares of fur leads to a sectioned-off area in the back."
