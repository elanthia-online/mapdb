      "Three small cushioned benches, each with its own floor-length mirror, are evenly spaced along the western wall.  A small potted palm sits between each bench and offers a bit of privacy.  In the ceiling above, square panes of glass allow moonlight to stream down, and brass sconces cast a bright glow across the benches.  Dozens of shelves along the eastern wall hold a series of bins filled with adornments, dyes, and trims in a vast array of colors."
