      "A clutch of honeycombed chambers rises out of the muck beneath the vaulting span of sponge-like stone.  Most are capped with waxy resin, but several have been breached, revealing pale, wriggling larvae in their jellied depths.  Coarse strands of ruddy silk sag from the edges of the bridge.  They sway in the humid breath of the cavern like ragged banners."
