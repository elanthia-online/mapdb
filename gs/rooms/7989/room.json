      "Light from several torches flickers over silver sconces fastened to the walls.  Legend has it that this heavily carpeted, soundproofed vault once successfully protected a king's ransom from an attempted siege by rampaging barbarians.  Few have attempted to breach the security of the members' steel-reinforced storage lockers in modern times, for tales of the consequences abound and are not for the faint of heart."
