      "From the ember light-limned ridge, the land slopes gently downward, and a meandering path emerges and proceeds through a tall vine-woven arch bedecked with a banner and into the valley below.  From this vantage point, the tops of hardwood trees arrayed in autumnal dress are lit from beneath, beacons of warmth in a perpetual twilight."
