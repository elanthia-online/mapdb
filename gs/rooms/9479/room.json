      "A damp, earthy smell permeates this shop and the light-giving potted mushrooms seen everywhere in town are almost lost in the profusion of other fungi.  Trays of mushrooms in damp soil are racked on the walls using wire shelves.  Small polished rocks have been strung on twine to form a bead curtain between the storefront and kitchen.  Beside the curtain, a smooth slate counter holds a variety of mushroom-prepared foods."
