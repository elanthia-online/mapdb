      "Thick vines have been braided to support a swinging bridge of scavenged driftwood planks that spans the gap between two flat-topped crags.  Every gust sets the bridge to swaying and makes its timbers creak in protest.  To either side of the unwieldy span is a plummet down onto knife-edged rocks strewn with old bones."
