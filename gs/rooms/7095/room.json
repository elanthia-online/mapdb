      "The south wall of this room is covered with chips of flat, colored stone, forming an intricate mosaic.  A carved stone bench is placed next to the door, opposite the mosaic.  A few shreds of cloth that might have been cushions a century or three ago lie on the bench.  A stone arch, carved all around with strong, blunt designs, leads off to the east."
