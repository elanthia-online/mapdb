      "A wide pathway cuts through the tent, which is composed of a patchwork of bleached hides stretched between a series of tiered support poles.  Colorful lapis and ruby-toned woven rugs are scattered across the ground near a flimsy yucca wood table, leaving the remainder of the ground uncovered.  Strung from double rows of thick ropes that hang at mid-chest level and directly in the midst of an incensed haze, finely crafted nakaten represent the majority of the shop's offerings."
