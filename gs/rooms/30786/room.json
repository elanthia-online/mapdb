      "The shrouds rising up a mast beyond the utmost a sail pass a lookout post that appears minuscule from this vantage point.  A length of sailcloth hangs over the railing, while several mops and buckets are pushed out of the way against the bulkhead.  The complicated rigging is attached to elaborate belaying pins along the ships railing above some cannons."
