      "Twisting tentacles of bronze frame a vast gate with sinuous bars wrought into the shapes of smoky tendrils.  To either side, high walls of tenebrous stone are painted with green wisps of smoke enshrouding writhing humanoid figures with lithe bodies and lovely shapes.  The gate opens onto a winding cobblestone lane that proceeds into the heart of a populous district of tall brick and stone buildings."
