      "The large, gear-shaped chandelier bounces light off of the bronze door, bathing the room in a dark golden hue.  A dark-stained rowan armoire looms in the far end of the room, casting a shadow in the corner.  Covering the eastern wall is a tapestry depicting a Burghal gnome holding a small trinket."
