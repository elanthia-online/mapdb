      "Lightweight willow poles curve across the domed ceiling in support of the heavy canvas used to create the domicile.  Glowing orbs rest within a fishing net strung above the entrance, their soft white light illuminating the wares displayed in various containers scattered about the fur-covered ground.  Hollowed-out and hardened by fire, dried gourds form a line of bowls down the center aisle."
