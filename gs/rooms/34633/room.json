    "description": [
      "Flames burn in recessed niches along the basalt base of an imposing spire stretching into the heavens above the yard.  Guarded by high curtain walls joining the outer towers, the courtyard is a bustle of activity.  Clanging hammers ring out from forges while aurochs drawing carts engage in uneasy lowing that is mostly drowned out by the din of the crowd.  Merchants' guards unload their cargo while servants in charcoal garb hasten past to their tasks.  A vast black iron portcullis offers egress to the street outside."
