      "Heavy curtains frame the murky windows that dominate the western wall, the ancient drapery threadbare and covered in skeins of cobwebbing.  Anchored to the ceiling and suspended over a long ebonwood counter, an antique and tarnished chandelier appears to be the playground of dozens of spiders as evidenced by the long strands of spiderwebbing that drift down from it."
