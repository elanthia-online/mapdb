      "The floor is tiled with gray granite, veined in shining huckleberry red.  Marble statues of halflings in various stances line the walls, giving the room a friendly atmosphere.  One statue in particular seems a focal point of attention, either by design or chance, as it stands somewhat apart from the others in the room."
