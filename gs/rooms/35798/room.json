    "description": [
      "The water here is a clear turquoise blue, fed by the waterfall that cascades down from the cliffs above. With the gentle splashing of the falls and the occasional birdsong, the air is filled with the scent of flowers and the chorus of peeper frogs.  Low mossy rocks circle the lagoon but lead upwards to a ledge high in the cliff. A small sandy beach area leads out to the estate's gardens."
