      "From the painted ceiling to the carpeted floor, this chamber has been rendered in the same, exquisite shade of red.  Carmine light dances off the lacquered surfaces of the red bookcases and cabinets that line the chamber's walls, their shelves displaying a collection of papers and pages.  A single staircase, rendered in red, descends into the chamber below."
