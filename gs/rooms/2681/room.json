      "The horizon is painted with shifting color, strange flickers playing in the clouds like distant lightning tinted with a monumental paintbrush.  Underfoot, a small cliff is formed by a rock outcropping.  It narrows into a trail which leads up to the southeast.  Another narrow trail leads northwest from a ledge below, and beyond that, the mountainside extends down in a dizzying fall.",

It narrows into a trail which leads up to the southeast.  Another narrow trail leads northwest from a ledge below, and beyond that, the mountainside extends down in a dizzying fall."
