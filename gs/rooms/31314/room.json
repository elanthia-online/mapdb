      "Fluffy white clouds cover the bright cerulean canvas lining the walls of the pavilion, the cotton-stuffed masses floating by a sun-shaped golden lantern hung above a curtain of silk and velvet-petaled roses.  An oversized bright clay planter stands at the forefront of the shop, flanked on either side by a display and rack woven from lacquered wicker, the containers surrounded by silk-petaled tulips dyed in a medley of colors."
