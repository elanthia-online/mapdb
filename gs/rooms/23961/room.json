    "description": [
      "A deep, constant rumble comes from the direction of the falls, and the swiftly moving waters of the Tempest flow toward the sound.  Tall reeds line the bank of the river, home to the occasional silently poised heron and the random splash of a startled frog or turtle.  Parallel to the river, an old overgrown dirt road leads to the east."
