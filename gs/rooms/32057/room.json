      "Foliated tendrils drape from the tree boughs, creating a natural corridor for the hazy creek to wind through.  The leafy veils softly radiate an aqua phosphorescence that tints the muddy path and the wispy, spindly spider lilies sprouted along it.  Spangling the verdant curtains with points of white light, bright orbs drift aimlessly through the threadlike vines."
