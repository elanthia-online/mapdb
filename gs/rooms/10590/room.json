      "Several broken plates, cups and other eating utensils are scattered among the dead leaves around the trees.  A burlap sack lies rotting in the midst of the kitchenware, as if someone had dumped a sack full of goods in the forest.  Small worms and other insects crawl in and around the debris, making their homes in it."
