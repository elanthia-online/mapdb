      "The silent simplicity of this small room brings contemplative thoughts to mind.  Several small mats cover the polished wood floors and two worn oak benches sit empty along the wall.  A modest rosewood altar stands at one end of the room, topped with two white candles.  A gentle breeze wafts from a hallway of gleaming white marble leading to the east."
