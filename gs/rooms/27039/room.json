      "Dark forms glide quietly through the water towards the distant shoreline of a tropical island.  A large lagoon lies directly to the north, its moonlit white beaches curtained by dense jungle foliage.  Small boats navigate the waters to and from a well lit dock to the east, virtually deserted for the night."
