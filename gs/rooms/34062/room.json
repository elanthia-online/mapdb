      "Cerulean pillars of glaes march evenly away from the doors, proceeding down the torchlit hallway.  The light reveals the hazy forms of preserved flowers trapped in the depths of the glass.  Mosaics along the walls depict preternaturally beautiful beings, each outlined in an aura of gemstone tesserae.  Twin fountains fill the air with the musical burble of falling water.  Their basins are tiled with jewels, and the water within is cold and clear."
