      "Scuffed teak boards form the framework of the large docking structure, with five distinct piers providing ample room for portage.  Each docking slip is padded with canvas-wrapped cork bumpers, and several sturdy support posts are connected by thick hempen ropes.  A large driftwood sign reads, \"Maelstrom Dock, Moonsnail Pier - Slips 11-15\" and has several painted green gems along the bottom."
