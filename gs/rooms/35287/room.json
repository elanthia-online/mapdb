      "Framed in pillars, the entry departs from the grey, white, and moss green pebbles at the edge of the avenue and transitions seamlessly to grey-veined marble.  Above, the underside of terracotta pan tiles are visible as they shelter the entry, extending around the curve to the inner sanctuary into the surrounding corridor.  Enormous doors of ironwood stand open, allowing entry to the round room beyond."
