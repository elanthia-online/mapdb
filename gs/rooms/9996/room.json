      "A patch of bright white wildflowers provide a spot of brightness in the shadow, having taken root in the thick, muddy soil that has fallen from the plains above and built into a thick layer over the years, seeming oddly out of place in the rocky desolation of the ravine.  The dirt drops off into a steep, slippery slope back to the rough stone floor of the chasm.",
