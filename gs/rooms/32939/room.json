      "Neatly arranged rows of boxes stacked upon each other against the walls display an assortment of styled hats, along with tiny plaques etched with prices in silvers.  An order counter at the back of the shop is shrouded in a haze of tobacco smoke, where a petite woman with a gem-adorned headband shrewdly gazes at everyone who enters."
