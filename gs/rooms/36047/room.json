      "Rugged vermillion felt wraps the central ger in sharp contrast to the two white gers flanking it, each topped with a pole bearing a streaming red pennant.  All three entries face the wide sweep of the valley's grasslands where bright violet-headed milkvetch grows thick among the yellow-green blades.  Goats graze along the edges of the trail, their movements parting the grasses in slow, shifting paths."
