      "Though a bit ramshackle and ill-built, the small one-room shop is built to hold out most of the cold.  Rods of various lengths and makes hang from hooks along the walls.  A firepit has been dug into the floor, and in it burns a small fire that warms the room and fills the air with the smell of woodsmoke.  Near to the slightly slanted counter sits a rhimar-lined black wooden chest that smells faintly of cold fish."
