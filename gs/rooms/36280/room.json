      "Polished, blonde bamboo floors stretch across the room connecting the various parts of the building with a unified appearance.  Creating artistic splashes in the slate grey walls, narrow floor-to-ceiling alcoves are fitted with decorative stained glass images, each illuminated by recessed glowing frosted orbs.  Upon the opposite wall, a series of framed artwork pieces are arranged in a variety of shapes and sizes around a keyhole archway fitted with a matching door."
