      "Well-lit, this sprawling circular chamber is filled with numerous couches, stools and chairs placed haphazardly about.  A massive glass ceiling allows a clear and transparent view into the pond directly above.  The faint sound of rushing water can be heard, although the exact source is unclear.  Looking almost out of place is a carved linden wardrobe that rests next to a slightly singed purple door, which adds to the unusual decor.  Placed in the center is a square driftwood table allowing for any number of conferences, debates and clandestine meetings."
