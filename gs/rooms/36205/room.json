      "A small desk is covered in several stacks of books, and a zivka-stitched quilt hangs between this area and the tent's entry.  A few sketches of Chirasi life have been affixed to the wall behind the desk, along with a rough map of an indeterminate area with a broad \"X\" marking one location in vibrant red ink."
