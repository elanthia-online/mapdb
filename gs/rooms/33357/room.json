      "The wide stairwell leads up to a worn and flat landing, enclosed by burnished wood paneled walls.  The head of a stuffed warcat has been mounted above an arched modwir door, its face covered in striped black and grey fur and its mouth frozen into a feral snarl.  A small brindle fur rug rests just before the door, its material weathered and matted with dried mud."
