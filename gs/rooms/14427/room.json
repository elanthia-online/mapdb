      "Near the floor, the wall tint is a blackish-grey that lightens upwards to a dusky hue the color of rain clouds as it reaches the ceiling.  The gradual shading suggests a subtle shift in the Pantheons, as represented by two small niches.  To the east, a small opening leads out onto the roof of the temple."
