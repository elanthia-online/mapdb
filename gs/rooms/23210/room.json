      "Shimmering, frost-covered glass walls enclose this soaring atrium.  Thick woven tapestries adorn the walls, each depicting a frigid wintery scene.  Small tables, each covered with snowflake-patterned lace and set with a gently flickering crystalline candle, are set around the edges of the room.  A large chandelier, draped with lengths of gauzy silk, hangs from the center of the ceiling.  A large stone fireplace surmounts one wall, with a thick polar bear throw lying on the floor in front of it.  Nearby, a glass door leads out into the garden."
