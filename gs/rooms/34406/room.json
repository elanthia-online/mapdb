      "Standing to either side of the open window is a pair of thick verdant ferns billowing over the rim of their bright ceramic pots, their leaves draping across a patterned crimson carpet.  A beautiful marble sculpture rests next to a polished mahogany door.  The floor sparkles as beams of sunlight stream in, catching the gold flecks in the marble."
