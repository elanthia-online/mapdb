      "Moonlight shimmers as it illuminates the surface of crystal droplets and covers the wide expanse of green with a silvery sheen.  A large area of the clearing, surrounded by beds thick with lavender, has been sectioned off for dancing.  A vine-covered white oak arch leads back out to the center of the meadow."
