      "Gravel slopes gently southwest, revealing piers where boats rock lazily in the turquoise waters just beyond a sturdy protective railing.  Behind the walkway, verdant bushes heavy with coral-hued roses add bursts of color, their fragrance mingling with the salt-tinged breeze.  Beachgrasses sway in rhythmic waves alongside the stone path, where white and grey pebbles crunch softly underfoot."
