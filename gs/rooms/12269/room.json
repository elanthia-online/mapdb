      "The soft sand of the path comes to a crossroads here with a less traveled route proceeding west and fresh footprints leading to a large sandstone building to the south. An empty cart with a broken wheel sits off to one side of the western path, the axel propped up on a wooden crate awaiting its owner's return. Flowerpots filled with bright yellow-leafed plants and deep green ivy fill the cart, their journey to a new home interrupted by the wheel's untimely demise.",
      "The path comes to a crossroads here with a narrower path proceeding west and a wider one leading south towards a large sandstone building. Two torches have been placed here but one has gone out making it difficult to see. An empty cart with a broken wheel sits off to one side of the western path. Flowerpots filled with leafed plants and ivy fill the cart, their journey to a new home interrupted by the wheel's untimely demise.",
