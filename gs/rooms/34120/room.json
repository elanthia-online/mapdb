      "Hexagonal pieces of rakkein are bound together with thick catgut and tethered to tall naked yew poles to create a domed tent with a shielded opening in its peak.  Braziers of copper and bronze are evening spaced throughout the large expanse to provide a comfortable warmth that is a contrast to the chill of its exterior.  Long mahogany racks are arranged along the walls, the tartan fabrics therein neatly folded and pinned for display purposes."
