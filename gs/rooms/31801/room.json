      "The slanted ceiling of the chamber is covered with a variety of drawings, the image of a wren transcribed over and over in different mediums and styles, its diminutive body violently slashed by a sharp object.  An unadorned desk and matching bed sit untouched by the wrought iron staircase, both surfaces covered in sheets of parchment with the same wren, obscured by dust and grime.  A coil of frayed rope lays beneath a wobbly wooden chair, the ends entangled between the marred legs."
