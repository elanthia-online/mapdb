      "Sunlight tickles the gossamer wings of hundreds of butterflies as they flutter to and from the deep, velvety purple petals of the butterflyweed that is planted in a wall beyond the tea and dog roses lining the cobblestone path.  Dormant lanterns sway gently in the breeze, their glaesine windows reflecting golden motes of light onto a nearby umbrella tree.  A carved alabaster bench can be glimpsed beneath the shelter of the curving boughs that brush the tall grasses surrounding it.",
      "Hundreds of fireflies dance and flit between the pools of lamplight that flank the cobblestone path, their tiny jeweled wings blinking in and out of existence as they move on the gentle sea breeze.  Glittering moonlight sparkles on the dew-kissed petals of tea and dog roses that lade the air with their heady fragrance and upon the elliptical and glossy leaves of a nearby umbrella tree.  A carved alabaster bench can be glimpsed beneath the shelter of the curving boughs that tickle the tall grasses surrounding it."
