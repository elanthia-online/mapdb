      "While the hutch is massive for an animal cage, it's still pretty cramped to be strolling around in.  Here and there, the metal framework sags inward and patches fill most of the holes.  Picking a path through the warren of detritus is a job calling for the skill of a Ranger Lord, the fortitude of a besotted Dwarf, and the sensibilities of a guttersnipe."
