      "Crafted from white oak, the paneled walls of the shop contrast with darker wood trim that accents the room.  Rich blue gauzy curtains frame the glaesine windows, filtering the sunlight to a pale glow.  The walls are lined with shelves filled with packets and canisters of tea and coffee, while a rhimar-lined glass case built into the front of the counter holds various flavorings and treats.   Mugs, teacups, and silverware are tucked in a padded crate resting on the floor next to a narrow stairway."
