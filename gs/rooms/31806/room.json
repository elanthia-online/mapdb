    "description": [
      "Tiny origami rooks seemingly float across the low ceiling of the room, their onyx paper wings pierced by thin iron hooks hung on brittle wire, and the paper avians are linked by cobwebs and dust.  An ebonwood-framed bed sits beside a wrought iron ladder, the bare mattress devoid of sheets and ornamentation and the narrow headboard snapped in half.  Flush against the high side wall is a marred writing desk, its surface penetrated by tapered blades bent at unnatural angles."
