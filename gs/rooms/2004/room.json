      "In the deep darkness of Greymist, the idea of dawn seems nonexistent.  The leafy canopy above hangs almost to the ground in places and thick twisted limbs reach across the path toward each other as if seeking a lover's embrace.  Cradled here in the arms of the forest is a great, gnarled mistwood tree.  Hundreds of clumps of withered lichen hang from its branches like an old man's beard.",
      "They say the night is darkest before the dawn, but dawn seems never to have come here to the dark heart of Greymist.  The leafy canopy above hangs almost to the ground in places and thick twisted limbs reach across the path toward each other as if seeking a lover's embrace.  Cradled here in the arms of the forest is a great, gnarled mistwood tree.  Hundreds of clumps of withered lichen hang from its branches like an old man's beard."
