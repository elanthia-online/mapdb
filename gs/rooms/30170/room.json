      "A card game in progress sits atop a makeshift table fashioned from rum barrels and oaken planks, the seats around the table a collection of footlockers and overturned buckets.  At the center of the room, discarded crates have been lashed together to form a small performance stage.  A rosewood mandolin has been partially concealed on a shelf behind a low bar crafted from mahogany running along the bulkhead."
