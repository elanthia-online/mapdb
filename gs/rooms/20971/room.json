      "The lush green hills are overgrown with deep red passionflowers and groups of tall heliconias.  The wildflowers are so dense, it is hard to move without ending up in an enormous patch of them.  Nearby, the grass has been flattened slightly, as if some sort of animal had been recently lying there."
