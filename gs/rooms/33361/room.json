      "A round felt-covered table sits in the center of the room, surrounded by several plush velvet-cushioned chairs.  Wisps of jasmine smoke drift through the air, infusing the area with a faint haze that lingers lazily.  A coral-inlaid dart board has been nailed into the wall near a tall, glass-paned, oak cabinet."
