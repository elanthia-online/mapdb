      "A small blue slate-clad manor house sits back from the var, apparently enjoying a second life as a shop judging from the small mithglin sign posted on the front steps.  Sweet-smelling fruit trees frame the manor's rough-hewn slate facade.  Tiny glaesine globes mounted on small iron stakes cast a gentle glow across the area.",
