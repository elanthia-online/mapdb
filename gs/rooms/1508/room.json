      "A silver portcullis yawns widely between two red brick walls.  Ivy clambers haphazardly over the walls, wandering where it pleases except two places where it has been neatly trimmed back: the portcullis and a silver plaque mounted on the right hand wall.  The ground is strewn with a thick layer of crushed brick that crunches loudly underfoot, and a bright banner ripples in the brisk sea breeze as it clings to the top of a tall flagpole.  Torches attached to the flagpole brightly illuminate the area.",

      "Red brick walls choked by a lush blanket of climbing ivy give way to a yawning silver portcullis.  The thriving greenery has been cut back on one wall to reveal a lustrous silver plaque.  Where it is not home to rampant greenery and creepers with blossoms in riotous, prismatic hues, the ground is strewn with a thick layer of crushed brick that forms a spiraling trail centered upon a tall flagpole flying a bright acantha leaf banner.  Torches at the flagpole's base await the onset of night.",
