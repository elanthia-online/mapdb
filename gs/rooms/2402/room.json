      "A twisting staircase with slender wrought iron rails spirals precariously up the back of the Nightowl Pub.  The stairs climb to a small grated ledge just below an open window on the second story of the ramshackle building.  Empty hogsheads, still smelling of the beer they once contained, are stacked beneath the staircase, as if to provide a splintery cushion for anyone who might fall.",
