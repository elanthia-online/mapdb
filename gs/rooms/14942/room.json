      "A fat rolton, looking much cleaner and less vicious than his less domesticated brothers outside the fence, rests in the sun by the side of the road, munching happily on the thick grass.  The aroma of roasting meat wafting over from a nearby cottage doesn't seem to interfere with his appetite."
