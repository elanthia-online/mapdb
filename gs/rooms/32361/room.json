      "The room is dimly lit by a chandelier fashioned from frayed rope nooses and carved ivory skulls, the hollow eyes glowing from candles hidden within.  Blood red walls stretch from the night black ceiling to the lush black carpet.  A small four poster bed, draped with silver satin curtains, occupies one corner.  A round table sits next to the bed, holding a decanter of dwarven whiskey.  One wall is dominated by a black marble fireplace."
