      "An immense crescent worktable sits centered on the back wall, with a swiveling cushioned barstool nestled in its cradle, allowing access to the full span of the work surface.  Almost an entire wall is covered by a large parchment illustration of a variety of plants, herbs, and fruits.  Hand-scribbled notes line its surface, some faded with age, others so fresh that the wet ink glimmers in the lamp light.  A few wine red damask-cushioned wingback chairs are arranged about in the remaining space."
