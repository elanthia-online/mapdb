      "Wrought iron fencing mounted with flower boxes of hardy snowdrops and vibrant purple crocuses encloses a spacious patio outside a frosted glass door leading into the home.  Sunlight awakens strange colors in the glacier encroaching from the north and the carved walls of ice holding the small town's burrows within their embrace.  Smoke trickles from the chimneys of several dozen buildings in an effort to hold the indefatigable cold at bay."
