      "Huge bellows and a tangle of ductwork hang from the ceiling, suspended by twisted wires and strapping made from some animal part.  It is not clear just how the bellows manage to open and close, but they do so with some regularity, although complaining loudly with each movement.  Heavy gusts of warm air flow out of the room with each compression, but the air does not reverse itself, as if the bellows are gathering their wind from somewhere else."
