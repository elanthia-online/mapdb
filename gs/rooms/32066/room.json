      "Skirted by a blood red spathe, a single titan arum with a cylindrical inflorescence dominates the flora with its massive presence and overwhelming malodor of rotting corpses.  The surrounding crimson-blushed plant life tilts away from the fetid flower, the tubular lime green pitchers shrinking back in curved curls to leave a clear circle around the tapered base."
