      "Gilt flakes glint from the street in front of a capacious bathhouse.  Their source is its arched sign, which has been flayed by the elements until the letters are unreadable.  A barricade of overturned wagons, splintered furniture, and heavy barrels has been shoved up against the doors.  The business's facade is otherwise windowless, and there appears no other means of egress."
