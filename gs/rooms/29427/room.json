      "Lining one wall of the spacious wagon is a series of marble-topped shelves elegantly displaying pieces of glittering jewelry.  Alabaster and sapphire silk bunting draped from the rafters above creates an elegant canopy.  Standing to one side of a carved mistwood door is a small table neatly stacked with a variety of jewelry pouches, while a small vaalin-framed sign hangs to the other."
