      "Narrow shafts of light strike through the thick canopy, doing little to break the unnatural darkness of the woods.  Running from the south to the northwest is a faint footpath, occassionally marked by upturned stones of regular size and shape.  Beyond the footpath, hidden in the veil of darkness, is the noise of the forest's inhabitants, sounding foreign and hostile in this dimly lit wood.  Underfoot, moist earth gives way easily, while the air grows thick and heavy with humidity.",
