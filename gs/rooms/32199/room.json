      "Windows encased in heavy drapery line the eastern wall of the corridor, while the west is covered in trophy cases and decorated in grey-on-plum bourde fabric.  Frosted globes perch upon brass lanterns, offering a crisp white light that dispels the twilight hues that spill in from the windows.  A pair of ebonwood bookcases flank either side of the corridor."
