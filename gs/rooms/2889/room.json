      "Below this prominence sits a small, oval shaped lake.  Its greenish waters are partially hidden behind a thick cloud of steam rising from its surface.  Tufts of snow coat the rocks of the short slope leading down towards the lake.  Occasionally a faint gurgling can be heard, its soft murmur becoming noticeable during a lull in the winds."
