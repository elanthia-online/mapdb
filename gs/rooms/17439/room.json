      "The split rail fence is interspersed with shrubs bearing small leathery leaves, pinkish urn-shaped flowers, and red berry-like fruits.  Some of the railings are beribboned in a rainbow of colors.  At the entrance, twin woodcarvings depict teams of brawny individuals separated by a long rope which forms the top of a doublewide gate."
