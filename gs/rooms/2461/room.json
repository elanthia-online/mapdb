      "Most of the shops along the way are prosperous two-story storefronts with clear glass windows and stately porches.   Fine furnishings glint in the candlelight from within a long wooden building near the end of the row.  Near the end of its freshly plowed front walk, a young trapper toils at the side of the road, pulling on a heavy sack of fresh skins.",
      "A brisk wind blows along the path here, carrying with it the sounds of heated shouts and cheers from the northwest.  A young halfling warrior toils at the side of the road, pulling on a heavy sack of skins."
