      "Stalks of monkshood sway in the shadows beneath the great citadel at the heart of the burg.  Their ghostly blue flowers and bright green petals are a splash of color against the bleakness of the tenebrous basalt wall behind them.  Tall brick buildings frame the roadway as it descends to the east, retreating into the sprawl beyond the great spire and its walled base."
