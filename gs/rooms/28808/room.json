      "A horrible sarcous substance clings to the stone walls in places, weeping yellowish fluid that smells of copper and sickness.  Whatever it is, the material is raw and pinkish like fresh-scraped flesh.  Strings of it drip from the ceiling like a horrendous parody of hanging vines.  It culminates in a tumorous mass along the far wall, taking the form of a quivering pinkish portal suffused with bilious green light."
