      "Nestled amid the skeletons of boxwood and blueberry bushes, a domed sinew and hide tent is flanked by a pair of burning torches.  Dried out river grasses are broken at odd angles along a single slush-covered track that leads to the center of the encampment, the footprints left in the dusting of snow a testament to the foot traffic.  Various colored tufts of fleece cling to nearby bare branches and tangle themselves between pelts of thick fur and leather."
