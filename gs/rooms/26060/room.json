    "description": [
      "Waiting at the end of the slope is a chamber ensconced in curving walls of blackened, blistered glass.  The shrine resides in sullen dimness alleviated only by pulses of emerald light from deep within the translucent barrier.  An immense slab of stygian granite, chased in patterns of molten copper and gold, dominates the center of the room.  Deep channels are burned out of the stone of the floor, their exacting, sinuous routes weaving a radiating and serpentine pattern around the black altar."
