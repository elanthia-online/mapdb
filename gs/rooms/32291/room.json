      "Slanted and unkempt, this meager porch is covered in a maze of cobwebs, and an invasive weed has hijacked the space between the splintering pine boards.  Monopolizing more than half of the floor space is a double-scooped rocking chair with a knitted blanket draped over the crest rail.  Next to the back door are two pottery bowls, one etched with the name \"Clarice\" and the other one \"Hannibal\"."
