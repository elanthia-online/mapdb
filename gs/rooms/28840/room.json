      "Suspended between two doorless huts is a bloated disease-ridden body hanging from a quartet of ropes, one tied about each limb.  They are drawn so tight as to provide neither the body nor the ropes any slack.  To the northeast, the path bends toward a cavern wall, but flickering light along the moist stone betrays the existence of a tunnel in that direction."
