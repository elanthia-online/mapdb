      "A framed gown sketch hangs on one of the rose moire silk-covered walls, and a silk-draped ceiling with a twinkling chandelier rises overhead.  A set of bronze masked nobles statues sits in one corner of a lustrous cream marble floor.  There is a gold-trimmed ebonwood chest on one side of the shop and a crystalline vanity table on the other."
