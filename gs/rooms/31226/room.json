      "Pewter-framed portraits cover the teal-colored walls of the shop, the canvases flanking a ceiling-high wrought faenor cabinet positioned beside tall marbled vases of half-unfurled ivory peonies.  A neatly piled stack of flannel-lined dark fel crates stand between gleaming suits of gilded armor, each container decorated in silver-inked calligraphy."
