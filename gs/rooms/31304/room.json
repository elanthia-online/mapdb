      "The grassy trail is slicked down from heavy foot traffic, but despite the humid conditions there is no mud to speak of.  A spongy layer of moss cushions every footfall while also reducing the ambient noise in the area.  The trail splits here, encircling a large pond fed from a small stream trickling in from the jungle.  Cattails dot the banks of the pond, and a large oak tree stands on the far bank, offering a bit of shade in this otherwise open expanse."
