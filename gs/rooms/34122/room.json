      "Stone grey and tightly bound at the seams, the heavy woolen walls of the tent form a cocoon-like enclosure around a small firepit ringed in smooth stones.  Several wickerwork containers line the walls, while bundled pallets offer sitting places closer to the warmth of the fire.  The hardpacked ground is covered with rakkein pelts, their woolly faces turned upward so that the fleece provides a comfortable cushion."
