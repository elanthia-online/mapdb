      "Clotheslines crisscross the air above the cobblestone street, the laden rope swaying in the dry air that sporadically touches upon the area.  Two-story homes, each with wide-opened windows and second-floor balconies, gaze down upon the road from beneath the shelter of their terracotta roofs.  Surrounded by curly-topped squid agave, a small open-air pavilion on the north side of the road is sheltered by an enormous arching dolphin statue of pieced-together coral and sea glass."
