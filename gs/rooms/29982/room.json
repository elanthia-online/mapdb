      "The ceiling has been hewn into a semicircular roof over a grand dais at the tunnelway's end.  Approaching steps are carved with feather patterns that culminate in etched ravens across the surface of the platform.  At the dais's center sits a broad altar of slick stone enfolded by carved wings, its looming presence starker black against the shadows of the pit."
