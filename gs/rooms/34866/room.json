      "Frost clings to the windows, tossing silver-limned abstract images upon the hardwood floor and producing a faint chill near the edges of the room.  Dried herbs, charms, and mementoes hang from the ceiling, their surfaces cast in flickering crimson and orange hues created by a fire that burns within a wrought iron stove.  Aged wicker chairs encircle a rustic oak table topped with a smattering of tallow candles that melt upon its surface."
