      "The beginnings of a stone fence encircle a small plot of land to the north, and tied stacks of hay are turning brown with rot where they stand.  Resting alone in the center of the hay is a grimacing scarecrow adorned with a rotting straw hat and strips of tattered cloth that stream wildly with the howling wind."
