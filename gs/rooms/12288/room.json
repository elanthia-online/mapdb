      "Filmy blue chiffon curtains blow gently in the breeze from the open windows, while a small calico cat snoozes beneath them in a patch of light on the floor.  Drying herbs hang from hooks upon the wall, waiting to be used in various medicines.  A small table covered with bandages and medicines sits next to a padded table covered with a sheet.  Next to an embroidered curtain rests a large basket filled with dried lilacs, giving the room a pleasant scent.",

A large quantity of lamps hanging overhead keep the room well lit.  A small table covered with bandages and medicines sits next to a padded table covered with a sheet.  Next to an embroidered curtain rests a large basket filled with dried lilacs, giving the room a pleasant scent."
