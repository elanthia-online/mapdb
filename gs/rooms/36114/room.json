    "description": [
      "Situated on the tidal-flow area of the river, this simple, sturdy pier is built from heavy yew planks fastened with iron nails to massive pilings sunk deep into the river bed.  Simple lanterns spaced evenly along the solid wood railings provide soft warm light against the night.  At the end of the pier, a small fish-shaped blackboard hangs from one of the pilings.  Two comfortable wood chairs and a pair of benches provide seating for fishermen or nature lovers."
