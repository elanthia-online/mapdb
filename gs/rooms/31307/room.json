      "A low, wide bridge spans the modest creek feeding a pond, and the air is suffused with the burbling of clear water as it tumbles its way through the shallow creek bed.  At the edge of the jungle, where the creek first becomes visible, a small herd of deer can be glimpsed through the trees, alternating taking careful drinks of water and eyeing the clearing warily."
