      "A painstakingly detailed relief looms over the bend of the gallery as its crescent mirrors the curve of the cavern wall.  Brilliant reds and flashes of silver-gilt punctuate a scene of battle between massive creatures in a snow-covered wood, with many of the combatants standing taller than the surrounding trees.  A lazily arcing bridge joins the gallery with one along the northern wall, its railing of bluish silver hoarbeam carved with an artful runic pattern."
