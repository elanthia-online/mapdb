      "The tight coil of treads and risers continues.  Along the wall, a thin eburnation smoothes a second spiral to complement the larger curve, as years upon years of bracing hands have worn the rough stone to a polished finish.  A single arrowslit lets in a bit of light, enough to see the outline of well-fitted trapdoor in the ceiling just above the top of the stairs."
