      "White-washed stone gives way to a gravel path that crunches beneath each step, winding through tall, swaying beachgrasses.  White sand presses up against the edges of the walkway, blending seamlessly with the soft hues of white and grey pebbles underfoot.  To the southwest, the pier of Sleeping Drake Harbor sprawl, its edges lined with bobbing boats.  To the southeast, turquoise waves sparkle, broken by travertine statues that rise elegantly from the water's surface."
