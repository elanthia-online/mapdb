    "description": [
      "Though it levels sharply downward toward the shoreline, the opposite side of the coral reef rises unchallenged to an unexpected height and density.  Towering thick and solid above the roughened teal waters, the reef condenses on the ocean-ward western side into a veritable cave of spiny organisms.  A small parting of that impenetrable bulk, just large enough to accommodate the frame of a small boat, holds the promise of calmer depths within the cocoon of the reef's embrace."
