      "A painted silk wall panel hangs on one of the ribbed black willow walls, and a low skylight-set ceiling rises overhead.  A plush black bear fur rug sits in one corner of a gold-speckled marble floor.  There is a beveled glass-covered case on one side of the shop and a flexible willow woven basket on the other."
