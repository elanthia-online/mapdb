      "The cramped quarters of this small market stall are stuffed chock-a-block with heavy boots of myriad sizing, which look to fit from the smallest of halflings to the largest of giantkin.  A makeshift counter, a heavy oak door laid across two splintering crates, appears ready to collapse under a mountain of footwear at any moment, and a sloppily scrawled sign hangs from a bent hobnail."
