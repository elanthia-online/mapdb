      "Beneath the thundering canvas of the mizzenmast, the quarterdeck rises imperiously toward the ship's blunt stern.  Mirrored sets of stairs ascend to the raised deck, leaving space for a black wooden hatch heavily reinforced with dark steel allowing entry to the cabin beneath.  Several barrels sit nearby in various states of disrepair, the golden frame of a compass atop one standing out against the dark wood."
