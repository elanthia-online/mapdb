      "Stands comprising tiered seats and steps of carved stone encircle the colosseum floor, providing an excellent view of the battles down below.  Bold banners, black and scarlet with a golden tower wreathed in flames on each, are held aloft by poles along the uppermost tier.  Marble steps descend back down to the lower reaches of the colosseum."
