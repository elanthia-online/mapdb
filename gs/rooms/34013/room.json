      "A wide bench seat has been placed to cover a dark hole across the back of the privy, a folding step stool before it.  Smoothly sanded to prevent splinters, the surface has been treated with a generous coat of varnish.  A wicker basket upon the bench holds some folded cloths, a bright-eyed yellow-haired doll, and a few illustrated children's books."
