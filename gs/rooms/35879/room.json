      "The flat, smooth surface of the dais is covered in a layer of perpetually falling grey ash.  Other than where the dais connects to some wide, stone steps leading down to the cobblestones of Glaes Court, seven granite pillars support the dais at equal intervals around its circumference.  Crowning each pillar is an artistically symbolic statue of a tool crafted with apparent dwarven styling: an adze, an anvil, an awl, a chisel, a grinding wheel, a hammer, and a hand saw."
