      "The walls of this room are filled with books, old and new.  A large, centered, modwir table gated with six chairs has several scrolls scattered on its scarred surface.  Two overstuffed chairs flank the fireplace to form a sitting area.  Atop the mantle, intricately carved silverwood dragon bookends brace several well-worn books.  A smaller version of the original painting found in the foyer of the House hangs above the fireplace."
