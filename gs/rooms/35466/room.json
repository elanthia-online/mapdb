    "description": [
      "Simple by nature, the interior of the hyrrad is surprisingly spacious and able to hold several containers of items for trade.  A small coffer rests in the farthest corner, and a neatly arranged display is positioned nearby.  Bereft of tables to place the containers on, a metal chest and a wood-sided case simply rest in the grass and rich soil of the forest floor beneath the shade of the hyrrad."
