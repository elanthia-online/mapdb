      "Dark blue silk canopies cover this spacious shop containing couches and chairs, with a thick ornamental rug covering the floor.  Similar burgundy silks drape the walls and windows.  Opposite the door, a counter holds a silver tray and a glass case, behind which is a wood shelf attached to the wall beside a curtained alcove.  In one corner of the subtly smoke-scented space, a small fireplace continually circulates air through its chimney to the outside.",
