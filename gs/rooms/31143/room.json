      "The overhanging stonework of Aspis' outer wall offers protection from the wind and rain.  Its darkly-veined red marble has been shaped into miniature columns and gargoyles - the latter seeming to follow your progress with their eyes.  An oaken door is carved to represent a top-down view of the city.  Very sturdy, it appears easily able to keep out all but Aspis members and their lucky guests."
