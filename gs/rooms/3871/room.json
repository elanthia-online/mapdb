      "The sandy path leads up to the front of a large sandstone building surrounded by tall island grasses and small banana trees still too young to bear fruit.  Bright green shutters frame each window while a sturdy iron-banded door presents itself as the entrance.  A rusting iron stand surrounded by a ring of colorful island flowers rests along one side of the path adorned, with a tattered and faded stuffed parrot that sits upon it.",
