      "Beyond a weathered wooden gate, a ring of oak bleachers is festooned from above with multicolored pennants.  Some flags are vivid and new, while others are as frayed and tatterdemain as the members of the hoarse-voiced crowd.  Poles topped with sharp spaded tips protect the arena floor below.  The pits are a flurry of commotion: cleaners bustling; guards standing in fractious watch over matches.  Beneath the commotion, the smell of blood lingers on the air, subtle as a snake."
