      "Polished walls of tropical woods are draped with netting holding a variety of gladiatorial weapons and armaments but in miniature form.  One corner of the room is fashioned to resemble a small arena, with a variety of Kraet dolls posed in fighting stances.  A matching olive wood display and counter rest on either side of the arena, each cluttered with toy gladiators."
