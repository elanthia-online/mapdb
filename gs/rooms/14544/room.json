      "A snow-white lop-eared rabbit hops about the fenced area off to the side, visiting the edge every now and then, where the children stand at watching it play.  The habitat has short grass spread throughout and a few bushes perfect for hiding.  A burrow can be seen near the middle, obviously the den for the creature."
