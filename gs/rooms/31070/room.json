      "Climbing at steep angle, the rocky path disappears from view as it curves around a large boulder that rolled down the mountainside.  Other clear signs of weathering are evident in the awkward position of trees and shrubs clinging to the rocky wall.  Bits of dust and debris blow about as the cold wind continues in sharp, stinging gusts."
