      "Dangling a variety of tools from small hooks secured around its frame, a wooden worktable displays a spread of blueprints, most containing various notes and markings.  Piles of sawdust swept into the corners are continuously stirred creating a blizzard of tiny particles that float through the air.  Recently completed, an elaborately carved cabinet exudes a mildly pungent odor of varnish."
