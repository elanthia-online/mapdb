      "Rising in majestic splendor, a huge ceiba tree towers over the river.  Its trunk is quite wide, anchoring into the ground with low, buttressed roots.  Vibrant white and pink flowers bloom in the canopy, attracting birds and insects with their color and fragrance. The fresh scent of sea air drifts in from the east, giving evidence of the ocean beyond the jungle.",
