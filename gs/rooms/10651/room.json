      "Enormous chestnut trees tower above the forest, their broad-rounded crowns one hundred feet in the air.  Massive, wide-spreading branches reach out toward the neighboring trees, providing a safe means of travel for the squirrels that chitter, unseen, from behind a veil of leaves.  Pale green moss covers the ground, its slight phosphorescence the only form of light beneath the canopy of trees.",

Pale green moss covers the ground, the only form of plantlife that thrives in the dull, grey light beneath the trees."
