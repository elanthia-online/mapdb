      "An old chair with a wobbly leg takes up most of the space under this crooked awning.  A string has been tied from the side of the tent to a post stuck in the ground, and dangling from it are dull-looking shears and carving knives.  Drifts of shorn hair cover the ground, forming hummocks and valleys of blond and brunette."
