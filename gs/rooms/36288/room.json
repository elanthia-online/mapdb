      "Finely grained teak-paneled walls join seamlessly with a polished stone block floor, blending in a flawless match of color and texture.  Dominating the center of the room is an interweaving spiral pattern etched into the floor blocks, the only decoration in an otherwise empty room.  The sole break in the seamless join of tree and earth is a square stone block embedded at hand level in the wood."
