      "Massive white marble pillars support a glass roof arching over this spacious circular meeting hall.  Sunlight streams liberally in through the glass to warm rows of plush black velvet seats facing the raised crimson dais.  Narrow windows set in each of the walls have been opened to allow fresh air to circulate throughout and maintain an even temperature.  Sparkling silver carpet cascades down the aisles between the rows of seats, ending at the dais steps.  Sconces on each pillar wait for nighttime use.",
