      "Wending its way along the river's edge, a muddy trail slips through puddles of snowy slush and various wild, thorny bushes that grow in profusion, their blooms withered away with the cooler temperatures.  Built across the trail is a wide palisade of bare saplings and narrow tree poles that are lashed together with rawhide and hemp.  To the east, a small encampment occupies a bend in the river."
