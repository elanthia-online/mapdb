      "Bright yellow paint coats the walls, which are bordered with grinning white skulls outlined in black.  The plank flooring is a mishmash of various unfinished wood types that creates a haphazard though artistic aesthetic, further enhanced by the dappling of spills of sunlight streaming through three large street-facing windows.  Filled with a variety of pies and topped with a small collection of jars, a broad, pristine display counter is surrounded by several wooden chairs and tables."
