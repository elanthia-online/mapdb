      "Deep green veined marble tiles spread across the expansive floor.  Thanot wall panelling is heavily carved with plants and flowers of all types.  Various semi-precious jewels, forming shimmering petals and leaves, have been inset into the floral carvings to great effect.  A low shelf lines the walls beneath the panelling, containing carefully preserved volumes."
