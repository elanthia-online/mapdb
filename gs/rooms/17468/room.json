      "All that remains are stumps that create a potential hazard as the surrounding area is practically devoid of trees, of any size.  Mounds of timber, covered by moldy canvas and held by chains are stockpiled in several spots behind a table.  To the south are several more clearings, each with its own set of spectator benches."
