      "Two paths converge into one here, ivory stepping stones from the southwest, obsidian from the southeast, creating a narrow, checkered path winding to the south.  The air surrounding the southern path shimmers with distortion, a copse of dark-thorned trees rising along either side to create a canopy overhead.  Skeletons of ships litter the waters of the ocean beyond, each worn from long exposure to weather.",
