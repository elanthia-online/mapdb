      "Neat and efficient, the kitchen has been organized to provide a cook with ready access to all of the tools and serveware contained in its numerous white pine cabinets.  In the center, a large wood table serves as a convenient place for prepared food and drinks to be served.  Behind it, a polished copper stove sits flanked by additional work surfaces while a small rhimar chest sits near the entrance."
