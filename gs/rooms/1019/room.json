      "The air is bitterly cold and dry.  The edges of the dull grey clouds above shimmer bright silver, reflecting the moonlight.  Grass taking root in patches of dirt rustles softly as the strong breeze constantly blows around the mountain.  The uneven rock face and small ledge are noticeably smoothed by the sand and dirt that ride the unrelenting wind.",

Clouds created by the high peaks of the mountain range drift slowly through the sky.
