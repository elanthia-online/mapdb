      "Canvas stretches across a sturdy oak frame, creating a small booth with an open front that faces the winding caravan trail.  Travel and loose shale cover the ground, crunching as guests come and go within the cramped shelter.  Long tables line the walls, while a series of copper hooks land in various ornaments hang from their affixed position along the oak beams."
