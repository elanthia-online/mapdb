      "Ebony-washed bricks create the framework of the mail office, the stones curtained in drapes of Nalfein ivy, creating a backdrop of ivory-edged vert leaves.  Floor-to-ceiling windows crafted from blackened iron are affixed with jade-lacquered shutters, the apertures allowing a seaside breeze to filter through the shop.  The narrow slots provide small glimpses of the bustling harbor, the faint sounds of the piers echoing against the counter-set dark stone walls."
