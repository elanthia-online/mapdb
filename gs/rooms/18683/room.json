      "The muddy ground is covered with a variety of tracks and grooves, testament to the heavy traffic that passes through.  Several large shops have been built around the intersection, and a number of small wagons and stands have been arranged in position to best peddle wares.  Lanterns have been hung with care where the streets cross, as well as near the entrance to each store."
