      "A single oil lamp hanging from the high vaulted ceiling illuminates the small oval chamber.  Smooth, dark-veined granite walls rise into the shadowed darkness.  Firmly bolted to the wall at one side of the room is a small, cast-iron ring.  At the far end of the chamber is a simple curtained opening."
