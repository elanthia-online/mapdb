      "Draped in long shadows, a rust-covered large iron anchor lies at the pier's edge, displaying its maritime antiquity for any that dare to look close enough.  A collection of buoys appears grey and silvered in the moonlight, the forgotten stack threatening to plunge into the night dark waters."
