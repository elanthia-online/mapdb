      "Encased in stacked slabs of ur-barath, this cold and damp chamber reeks of metallic-tinged aromas, as if it were a carnage-filled battleground in recent times.  Thin blades sharpened to a fine point jut out from the front of a crimson-tinged stone bloodforge, and droplets of what appears to be dried blood stain the floor surrounding the workspace.",

Thin blades sharpened to a fine point jut out from the front of a crimson-tinged stone bloodforge, and droplets of what appears to be dried blood stain the floor surrounding the workspace.  Piles of crimson powder cover the floor beneath a large opening.  A dwarven blacksmith assistant stands in front of a narrow archway leading toward the smithy.  An undorned staircase spirals toward the temple."
