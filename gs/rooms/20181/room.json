      "Fetid, cloudy water has consumed the floor of the manor house, rising to devour the first few steps of a carved wooden stairway.  The stairs themselves are blocked by a pile of white bricks that have fallen from the collapsed ceiling.  All around, the manor's walls creak and groan in protest, as if mourning their own slow death.  A pair of warped double doors, long-since stripped of brasswork and jeweled adornment, open onto the remains of a ballroom to the east.",
