      "Dense curls of fog unfurl over the stream, suffused with a pale, prismatic glow reflected from the light limning the rippled water.  Alongside the banks, hundreds of golden eyes stare blankly up from the slender, pointed petals of dwarf crested irises.  Translucent sage green leaves branch from glittering wood moss, feathering the edges of the scraggly, roughly blazed trail."
