      "You find yourself at the south end of the Guild's massive courtyard.  A cobbled path leads from the portcullis on the southern wall, circumnavigates a gushing fountain to the north and leads up the steps to the Guild Hall.  A pair of foot-worn dirt paths leads northeast and northwest through the otherwise manicured lawn, paralleling the Guild walls."
