      "Standing this near to the waterfall, the roar of the water pounding on the rocks at the base of the cliff drowns out all other sound.  A natural jetty of rocks reaches out into the lake and across the base of the cliffs.  The waterfall descends in several stages, disrupted by outcroppings of rock, causing it to fall in a series of tiers and spreading out to a wide curtain of falling water."
