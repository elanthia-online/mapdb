    "description": [
      "Dense woodland crowds in upon the trail as it meanders away from the heart of town.  The branches of snow-draped trees weave together into a dark blanket that is leavened only by the occasional flicker of candlelight from ramshackle dwellings in the woods.  The whistle of trees through the branches is an ever-present melody, haunting and cold.  Bending gradually toward the northwest, the path cuts under the shadow of a skeletal elm whose branches wait like snatching talons over the walkway."
