      "Gilt-threaded banners of crimson velvet decorate the walls of the pavilion, the stylized wyverns standing rampant above a fortress adorned in a row of rounded shields.  A circular table of carved mahogany splits the center of the room, surrounded by high-backed chairs padded in leather, each one given equal space across the wood-planked floor.  Spherical lanterns are scattered along braided ropes strapped across the ceiling, each piece caged in brilliant eahnor."
