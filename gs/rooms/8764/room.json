      "This is more a bridge than a street, extended over a long pond which continues to the east.  Though the waters are clear, you cannot see the pond's bottom.  A school of silvery fish races about, incredibly agile and fast.  Narrow wooden pathways lead off the bridge to a few homes built on the water's edge."
