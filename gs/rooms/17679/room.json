      "The height of the tunnel lowers considerably as it comes to an abrupt end with a dark soil wall.  Light floods the area from a narrow circular opening at the end of the tunnel and is accompanied by the smell of wet animal fur.  Numerous paw prints cover the floor, criss-crossing every which way, along with scratch marks in the walls.  To the northeast, the tunnel widens, and the flickering light of a torch can be made out from behind a dark bend."
