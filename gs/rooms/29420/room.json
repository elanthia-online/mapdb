    "description": [
      "Cozy, but not cramped, the backroom of the wagon features a plush oval rug patterned with stylized starbursts of azure, viridian, and amethyst.  A small antique table and chair have been set in front of a moss-curtained portion of wall.  Several small travelling chests occupy space along the other walls.  Fragrant incense drifts out of an ornate censer hung from the ceiling."
