      "Massive roots jut from the ground, only to burrow once again and vanish as they find purchase in the jungle floor between a semi-circle of tents and stalls.  Thicker than most trees and arching higher than a full-grown giantman, the roots converge near a dense wall of brambles and hanging mosses.  The blinking yellow-green lights of fireflies illuminate the area, revealing the boughs of a gigantic redwood beyond the tree line to the west."
