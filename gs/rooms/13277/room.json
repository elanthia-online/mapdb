      "A rough-woven carpet, comfortable and perfect for lazing upon, covers the hardwood floor of this lounge.  Lit from below by candle sconce's, several bright banners advertising gatherings and festivals from around the lands hang from the vaulted ceiling.  Cracked and worn, a battered begging bowl sits in a place of honor on the mantel of the large marble hearth, framed by a heavy slate blackboard and a fan-shaped message board backed by pale gold muslin on either side.  A modwir keg rests near the hearth, ready to provide refreshment, while a simple wooden wastebasket is set near an arch.",
