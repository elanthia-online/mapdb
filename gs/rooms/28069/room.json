      "Gilded fixtures are placed throughout the space, giving a touch of class to this elegant display room.  Spread across one section of flooring is a layer of clean straw bedding.  A varnished red maple hay rack has been affixed to some rough-hewn wall planks, beside a red-banded platinum feed pail.  A display table resting in the straw shows off the appearance of a lion-etched red watering trough.  Prominently nailed near the entrance is a large parchment notice.",
