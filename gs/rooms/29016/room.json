      "Sunlight streams through twin brass-framed portholes, reflecting off a seaglass wave mosaic in shades ranging from pale green to deep ultramarine imbedded in white-plastered walls.  A driftwood collage of a mermaid caught within a net hangs from a wooden beam, partially hidden behind a a stained teak counter."
