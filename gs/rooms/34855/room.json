      "Rough-hewn wooden beams support a ceiling of thatch-covered planks of various lengths and thicknesses.  Flickering light from a single oil lamp throws irregular shadows across the uneven stone walls.  Several large clay urns are scattered about a woven rug centered on the rugged stone floor.  A small archway covered with a tattered blanket is partly hidden by a series of makeshift shelves suspended from rusted chains hanging from the supports above."
