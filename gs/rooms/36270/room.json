    "description": [
      "Beyond the arched stone doors to the south, the meeting hall has been carefully arranged to accommodate an audience of nearly any number.  Long tables neatly form up the center of the room, each chair turned to face the modwir podium at the main wall, above which looms a massive golden tapestry bearing the Militia's crest.  Several smaller tables and booths surround the area beneath arches of stone, offering more private seating away from the center of activity."
