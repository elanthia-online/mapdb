      "The surface of the forecastle rests in the shadow of the topsail and its wooden planks are a stark contrast to the main deck below.  Old stains from a mixture of blood, ale, and fish guts have discolored the flooring along every board near the railings.  A few wooden barrels sit in the center of the main railing, each one crowded with some tackle boxes, lures and tiny metal hooks.  Some carved wooden benches rest on each side of the sculpted bronze figurehead that faces out towards Darkstone Bay."
