      "The dressing room is spare in furnishings.  A couple of chairs are provided, one sitting before a dressing table with a large mirror.  Across the back wall, a row of pegs provides a place to hang clothing and costumes, and a couple of shelves are mounted to the side for miscellaneous props and paraphernalia.  A lantern sitting on the dressing table offers the only light in the chamber, tucked away on the stage's back wall with no window."
