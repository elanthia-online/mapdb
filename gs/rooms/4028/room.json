      "Dark sapphire blue velvet frames a glaesine mosaic on the rear wall of this small office.  Illumination in the form of several oil-burning glaes sconces casts a flickering light that dances across the mosaic, reflecting small multicolored spots of color across the worn stone floor.  An ornately carved monir desk occupies the center of the high-ceilinged room."
