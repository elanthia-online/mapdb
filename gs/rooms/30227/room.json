      "The oak and teak pier is punctuated with rope-wrapped posts at regular intervals, and cork and canvas bumpers pad each docking slip.  The soft sound of waves slapping against wooden support posts fills the air, and the pervasive scent of salt water and rotting seaweed drifts upon the wind.  A carved driftwood sign reads, \"Knotty Beldrin Pier - Slips 6-10.\""
