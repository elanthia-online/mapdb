      "This room is sparse and simple, reflecting the stoic nature of its occupant.  On one side of the room is a bed with a simple wooden frame and headboard.  On the other side of the room stands a mahogany cupboard for storage.  Looking down, you see the room's one concession to luxury, a delicate mosaic of small tiles set into the floor forming an abstract pattern of colors and textures."
