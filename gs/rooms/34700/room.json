      "The hallway is dark and cold, with a hint of mildew lingering sour on the air.  A scant few candles are placed in niches to light the darkness, and their radiance seems feeble against the greater darkness pressing down on the passageway.  All along the eastern wall, reliefs are carved out of porous black stone.  Time has smoothed but not erased their procession of images.  Overhead, a star with six tentacles has been carved into the ceiling."
