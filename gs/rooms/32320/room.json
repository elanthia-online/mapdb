      "[Olbin Delta, Broken Statue]"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Atop the high hill stands a statue of black volcanic stone, its features corroded by the ocean air and eroded by the snow and storms.  Broken in half, the statue's lower legs strike a heroic posture, oriented toward the ice-dotted sea to the northwest.  The remains are scattered amidst the snowy grasses covering the hilltop.  Only a faint hint of salt seasons the air, which is otherwise crisp and clear."
