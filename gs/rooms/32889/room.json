      "Lurking in the dark, buildings rise upon the western edge of the cobbled street in crowded groupings, while to the east the off-white walls of Old Ward Wall rise skyward.  Runnels upon either side of the cobbled thoroughfare are filled with sand, which has blown in from the city's gates to the north.  The air shimmers to the south and north where the heat of the day causes refraction."
