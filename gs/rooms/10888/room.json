    "description": [
      "This small yard is bounded on the east by the walls of the Captain's Quarters, on the west by a reed-lined creek, and on the northeast by the tall stucco wall of the River's Rest Hoosegow.  A rabbit hutch stands against the wall of the Captain's Quarters.  A pathway leads north between the creek and the Hoosegow wall.  The fetid smell of the slow-moving creek water competes with the acrid smell of the hutch.  The moons glint off the surface of the creek.",
