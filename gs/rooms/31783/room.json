      "The broken hulls of wooden toy boats litter the sandy walkway, their skeletal remains occupied by a scant number of elven-crafted tents huddling by a dwindling fire.  A viscous black liquid forms a near-perfect circle at the center of the neighborhood, the edges smeared by the tentacles of a giant mechanical kraken lashing out from beyond the shoreline.  Flashes of jagged teeth and massive incarnadine wings dart from behind the tents, disappearing quickly in blurry waves."
