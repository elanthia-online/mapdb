    "description": [
      "Covered in overlapping rugs in sage green and saffron hues, the display room has soft lighting and a sense of quietude.   Floor-to-ceiling white shelves occupy the entirety of the northern wall and house a variety of minerals and ores in their natural state.  Arranged completely opposite of a storage table is a low display case covered in rich velvet, its sides glassless and its legs fashioned of bronze."
