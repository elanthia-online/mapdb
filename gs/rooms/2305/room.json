      "Children dash down the street, filling the chilly air with high-pitched laughter.  Although many are halflings, there are just as many giantkin and half-krolvin among them.  They weave in spritely chases through the traffic before a snow-covered wooden lodge while a small coterie of sylvankind youths follows at a more sedate pace.  Several would-be merchants near to the lodge hawk rings and other tokens of affection.",
      "You are nearly bowled over by a large group of children dashing by on the cottage-lined street.  They seem to be chasing an impish lad who is carrying a small shoe and, as one of the pursuers has a single bare foot, you can see how the chase started.  Given the situation, you aren't certain who to root for.",
      "A cold wind bears the promise of a coming storm down the street.  Most of the cottages are quiet and dark, but here and there a candle burns in a window to light the way home."
