      "The pale, varnished wooden floors and whitewashed walls of Sprytea's store are designed to show off her merchandise to best advantage.  Glinting window displays hang from white oak beams high in the lofty ceiling, lending the sophisticated air of an art gallery to the cool, quiet shop.  Only the occasional murmured transaction or footstep on floorboard breaks the soft silence."
