      "A two-toned stone wall absorbs the heat of the sun.  A young couple leans against the warm stone as they share some piping hot tarts.  The sight of food, coupled with the smell of baked goods that lingers over the area, inspires some passing townsfolk to hurry along to the nearest bakeshop or pub.  A few glance over their shoulders as they skulk toward the entrance to Bootlegger's Alley.",

      "A two-toned stone wall still radiates the warmth absorbed during the day, and an old couple leans against it as they rest from their travels.  The cold winds that whip around this corner of the town inspire the few passersby to hurry along to the nearest pub or inn."
