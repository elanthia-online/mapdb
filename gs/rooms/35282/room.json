      "Ferns in autumn-hues rise around a small babbling brook where a gently arched wooden bridge provides access to other parts of the garden.  Surrounded by decorative blooms, a small red marl and travertine patio set with white wrought iron chairs and tables rests before a three-story vivid green library with cheerful yellow accents.  Off to one side, a small fountain is surrounded by blown glass hummingbird feeders and marble bird baths amid colorful butterfly weed bushes."
