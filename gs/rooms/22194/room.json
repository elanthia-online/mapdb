      "A sprawling riverstone stable stands in the shadow of the towering bailey wall, flanked by several large apple trees.  Rows of open-front stall doors face the lawn, and a large dirt paddock is enclosed directly in front of the building.  Attached to the east side of the stable is a smaller riverstone house, behind which is a low dormitory."
