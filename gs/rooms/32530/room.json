      "An Arkati pantheon painting hangs on one of the varnished ebonwood walls, and a vaulted ceiling rises overhead.  A tiered alabaster fountain sits in one corner of an enameled hardwood floor.  There is a gold-veined black marble counter on one side of the shop and a silk-lined display case on the other."
