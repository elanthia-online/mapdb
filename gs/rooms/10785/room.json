      "Littered with a layer of dried leaves, animal droppings and other woodland debris, the warped wood plank floor of the leaning shack creaks beneath your feet.  Pale rays of moonlight filter through the gaping holes in the hide roof, shedding a soft illumination across the remains of this small room.  A scratched wooden counter and various pegs and racks hung from the walls attest to the idea that this structure may have once been a shop of sorts, but its exact nature has been lost to time.",
