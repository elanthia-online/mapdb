      "Ferns lean in close to either side of the path, spotted with raindrops that make them glitter like rainbowed jewels in the golden half-light filtering through the jungle canopy.  Old, stout palms that are many times the height of a giant form bowers over the road of hard-packed dirt and stone, mimicking an immense structure further on up the trail.  The narrow walkway cleaves close to the uneven walls of the spire as it strives to ascend."
