      "Sprawled in a heap on the ground, empty eye sockets staring up into the unfeeling light of the aurora, is an immense humanoid corpse.  The stiff, icy body is of sufficient size to mostly block the walkway, and the snow around it is tinged a startling red.  Prints, both humanoid and lupine, encircle the corpse, but despite an arm that ends in a jagged stump, the body seems unmolested since death claimed it."
