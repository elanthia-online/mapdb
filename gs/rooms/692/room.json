      "The long rows of bookshelves that line the adjacent halls meet here at the corner of the library.  Faint beams of colored light stream in through a series of arched stained glass windows set high in the walls.  At the juncture of the bookcases, a great marble arch leads out of the library, while a pair of gilded columns marks an entrance to the central atrium to the northwest.",
