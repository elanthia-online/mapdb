      "Smooth algae-covered river rocks line a short, winding path from one dock to another beyond a gap in the ichor-covered foliage.  The trees here are wilted and withered, succumbing to whatever terrible malignancy has afflicted them.  A dilapidated rickety fishing dock barely clings to the end of a gangway beyond a battered wooden sign stained with dried blood, disappearing and reappearing in an undulating wall of hanging white mist.  Humanoid forms shift within the mist, their nature unclear."
