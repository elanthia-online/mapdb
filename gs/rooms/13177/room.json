      "Worn smooth by years of booted feet, a path of cobblestones leads the way through the gatehouse.  Steepled over the path are walls fashioned from timeless black basalt, scoured nearly smooth by the cold mountain wind.  Draped from the walls are some sapphire blue banners adorned with silver heraldry.  Beneath the banners, a massive black glaes portcullis pierces the wall, opening into a desolate, deserted courtyard."
