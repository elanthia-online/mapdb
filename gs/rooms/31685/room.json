      "From this elevation, the whole of Evermore Hollow unfolds below like a map unfurled, offering an unfettered view of the town and all of its surroundings.  The sky behind the dark buildings shifts unceasingly through an array of colors, the twilight background merely a canvas for strokes of paint orchestrated by an unseen hand.  Overhead, a light breeze rustles through the trees, and an intricate wooden bench invites visitors to take a rest and enjoy the view."
