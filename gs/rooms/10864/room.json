      "Two stately magnolias stand as sentinels before a black wrought iron gate.  What the gate is attached to has been entirely obscured by the dark green privet hedges that crowd the gate on both sides.  Torches mounted in wrought iron sconces blaze brilliantly, illuminating the entrance and surrounding area.  A large banner suspended between the magnolias sways gently in the warm breeze, and a lush layer of bluegrass carpets the area except for the well-worn path leading to and from the gate.",

What the gate is attached to has been entirely obscured by the dark green privet hedges that crowd the gate on both sides.  Torches mounted in wrought iron sconces protrude through the hedge, awaiting the onset of night.  A large banner suspended between the magnolias sways gently in the warm breeze, and a lush layer of bluegrass carpets the area except for the well-worn path leading to and from the gate."
