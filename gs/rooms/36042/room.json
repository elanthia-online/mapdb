      "Thick furs soften the hard ground beneath low wooden tables heaped with wares, several overstocked baskets tucked underneath.  A central brazier burns warmly, its smoke curling up through a hole in the tent, casting dancing shadows across woven blankets hung for decoration and added insultation.  Hanging strings of colorful beads sway gently as cold wind drafts blow through the canvas opening."
