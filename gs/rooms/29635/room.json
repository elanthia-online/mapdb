      "Emblazoned with a white ram motif, a brown conical tent of chocolate brown with an inverted crenellated top of plum occupies a clearing to the northwest.  Pristine white aspens stretch their slender branches into the sky, while their vibrant hued leaves form a colorful canopy that fairly quakes at the hint of a breeze.  Patches of snow, half melted in the sunlight, assist in watering the tall beauties and play a part in producing the mud on the divergent trails.",
