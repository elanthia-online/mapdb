      "Hardly more than an alcove off the main chamber, this small cave has been fitted with the basics needed for alchemy.  A stack of cauldrons of various shapes and sizes sits at one end, and assorted herbs hang from the ceiling.  Small boxes are set along natural shelves and nooks in the rock walls, though their contents are a mystery."
