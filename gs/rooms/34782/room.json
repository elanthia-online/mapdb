      "The neighboring environment has a sophisticated appearance as the ground lacks the slightest evidence of dust upon its polished surface.  Waist-height walls to each side of the path have a rigorous, yet almost jagged, appearance.  Peculiar looking trees seem to spike out of the ground in geometric forms, suggesting that they have grown beyond their natural pattern."
