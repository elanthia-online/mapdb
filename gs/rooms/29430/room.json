      "Rivulets of ice and frost-crested mosses pool in the clefts of a flinty precipice that extends over the briar-filled provincial lands past the settlement.  A pair of indentations are worked into the adjacent cavern's rubble as high-placed graduated shelves; the first a darker stone inset with sparkling grey-banded striations, and the second a lighter ashen cream fraught with pearlescent inclusions.  Shivering with silver-white flame, countless nacreous tealights dot each footpath beneath the twin shrines."
