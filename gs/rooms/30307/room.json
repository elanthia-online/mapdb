      "Palms and shrubs near the edge of the canopy offer additional shade, a brief respite from the relentless heat of the desert.  In the center of this makeshift stall, a stone-ringed firepit takes up most of the workspace, a large bronze anvil sunken into the sand beside it.  Racks and cases are haphazardly scattered about the stall, the sand around the oasis already finding its way into every nook and cranny."
