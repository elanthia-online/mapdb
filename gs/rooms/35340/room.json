      "Teak walls frame the shop's interior, their surfaces lined with shelves displaying trinkets, oddities, and small treasures.  A long counter with a smooth, worn top runs along one side, its drawers filled with ledgers and cloth-wrapped parcels.  Several cases hold polished jewelry and rare coins, their surfaces reflecting the glow of hanging lanterns.  Braided rugs cover the floor, softening footsteps, while narrow windows let in gentle sea breezes.  A ladder leans against a corner shelf stacked with books."
