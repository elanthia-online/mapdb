      "Aged layers of sheet music line the pale azure-colored walls of the shop, the calligraphy-inked parchments glazed in a lacquer of silvery gold and encircled by lily-crafted wooden frames.  Miniature carvings of various instruments are angled across a silk-draped counter, the diminutive woodwind and percussion pieces nestled between pieces of musical note-shaped glass wrought in swirls of color."
