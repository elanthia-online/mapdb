      "Cabinets painted in deep cobalt line the khana, each surface adorned with knotwork sun symbols that loop and twist across the wood.  Plump qiviut cushions are arranged in a loose circle, folded fleece blankets in muted hues draped across them.  An intricate tapestry rug sprawls beneath it all, its four woven quarters shifting from the pale tones of spring to the saturated heat of summer, then into autumn's russets and winter's stark whites.  Small clay stoves rest at intervals, their steady warmth softening the air."
