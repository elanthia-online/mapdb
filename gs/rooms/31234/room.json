      "Pale mistwood poles stand in each corner of the tent, holding the silk canopy high overheard.  The ground is covered by a plush pewter-hued velvet rug, with a circular cottonwood rack standing atop it in the center.  A delicate faenor chain curtain partitions off the rear of the tent and also provides access."
