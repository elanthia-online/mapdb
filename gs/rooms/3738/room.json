      "Tiny, colorful songbirds and magnificent honeysuckle vines on hand-painted white silk wall coverings reach up to the high, coffered ceiling.  Lit crystal-shaded golden oil lamps rest on tables scattered around the plush green carpet.  Overstuffed armchairs circle each table.  A tall leaded glass window offering a view of a bustling courtyard neatly frames a wide bench seat with pale golden silk cushions.  Opposite the window is a tray-covered pearwood sideboard.",
