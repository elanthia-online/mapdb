      "A trio of cushioned ebonwood wagons line the sides of the boardwalk, their chain-bound cargo hidden beneath heavy layers of fur and pelts.  Ivy-draped niches, crafted from grey-stained ironwood, are affixed beneath an oiled leather canopy, its recesses filled with wax-sealed envelopes and rolled maps tied with silken ribbon.  Tall faenor-forged lamp posts stand at each corner of the boardwalk, the spherical lanterns loosely draped with garlands of dark naefira, filling the air with their heady fragrance."
