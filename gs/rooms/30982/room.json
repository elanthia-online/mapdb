      "Moonlight pouring in from two huge bay windows blankets every surface in this spacious shop, rendering the burnished imflass sconces along the walls merely helpful but not necessary for navigation.  Anchored between them, towering hazel shelves crowded with boxes of all shapes and sizes stretch to the back of the room where a narrow mica-topped counter houses a sturdy haon cashbox."
