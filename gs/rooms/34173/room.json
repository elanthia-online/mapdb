      "A vein of quartz streaks through the floor of the tunnel, its stark white clashing with the granite to either side.  The stripe continues up one wall in a glittering stratum, where it is riddled with arteries in a variety of colors from rose to pale turquoise.  Several broken shards of stone litter the ground, having evidently rolled down from a raised portion of tunnel to the northwest."
