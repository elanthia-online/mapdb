      "Set between two large gated residences, a low dark building is visible to the north, its dirtied windows and peeling coat of paint imparting a very dilapidated, abandoned look to the structure.  Faint shadows of movement shift within its dark interior, lending an ominous feeling that's supplemented by the silence pervading the area."
