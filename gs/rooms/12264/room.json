      "Colorful corals have been used to build a short but stout wall on each side of the pathway here.  Upon the wall, a number of flowerpots planted with daisies, petunias, and chrysanthemums sit in a menagerie of color.  Oblivious to passersby, small bees fly among the pots, jumping from flower to flower in an exotic pollination ritual.",
      "Pieces of coral have been used to build a short but stout wall on each side of the pathway here.  Light from the torches cast a dance of shadows across it, making a ghost-like scene.  Upon the wall, a number of flowerpots planted with daisies, petunias, and chrysanthemums sit in a menagerie of color."
