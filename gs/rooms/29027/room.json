      "Curving away from exposed bedrock and warped boulders to the southeast, a hard-packed dirt road cuts through a forest of hardwoods on a westerly track.  Bubbling brooks, coaxed from their natural pathways, tumble down either side of the road in manufactured beds of black, grey, green, brown, and white pebbles.  A slant of sunlight pierces through the heavy canopy to illuminate the area.",

Bubbling brooks, coaxed from their natural pathways, tumble down either side of the road in manufactured beds of black, grey, green, brown, and white pebbles.  A patch of dazzling starlight pierces through the heavy canopy to bathe the area in a halo of silver illumination."
