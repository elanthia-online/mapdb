      "The road is lined with tree stumps, shrubs and weeds.  It runs toward the base of a canyon, which opens to the south.  A great mountain dominates the horizon beyond the canyon.  The peak is ringed with dark storm clouds.  The outer walls of a good-sized town are barely visible within the canyon."
