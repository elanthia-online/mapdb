      "The northernmost stretch of the main deck dead-ends into a red-dyed sephwir hatch bordered to either side with spread-winged firebirds of gold leaf.  A set of initials are carved into the port bulkhead, the smooth and glistening wood around them testament to their resistance at attempted removal."
