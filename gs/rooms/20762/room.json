      "The chamber is octagonal in shape, with padded stone seats at the base of each of the floor-to-ceiling windows that peer out from the exterior walls.  Heavy tapestries edged with gold fringe hang on the darkly paneled walls between the windows.  Opposite these, a simple stone fireplace resides in one wall, flanked by ensconced torches set at the level of the mantel.  On opposing sides of the hearth, a rounded archway and a carved dark oak door lead out of the room, the light from the flames not penetrating to illuminate what lies beyond."
