      "Fluted limestone columns support a spacious pergola strung with strands of glowing glass spheres, the hawthorn slats overhead dividing the star-strewn sky into slivers.  Painted bright white, standing flower boxes frame the shelter on three sides, housing aromatic profusions of lavender and sage.  Amaranth-hued cire canvas cushions soften the stylized chairs arranged around a scattering of lattice-topped wrought iron tables."
