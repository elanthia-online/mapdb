      "Lager Road turns slightly, bending away from a solitary building with boarded up windows.  The edifice's clapboards are grey and weathered, contrasting starkly with the raw wooden planks across the doors and windows.  It almost appears as though the building was transported intact from another town, then allowed to fall into disuse.",

The building's clapboards are grey and weathered, in contrast to the light tan planks across the doors and windows.  It almost appears as though this building was transported here intact from another town, then never used."
