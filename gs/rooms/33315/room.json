      "Lashed to the beams on the slanted ceiling, fragrant herbs infuse the air with a medley of vegetal aromas, mingling with the earthy, woodsy scents of fur and leather from the varied hides draped over the sparse furniture.  An austere iron lantern casts foliated shadows over the bark-stripped rack fashioned from branches against the back wall.  Pulled halfway open, an undyed flax curtain splits the windowless space, a deer-carved oak chest sitting open beside the loosely gathered fabric."
