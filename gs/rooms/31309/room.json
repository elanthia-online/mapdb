      "Organized chaos reigns over the well-stocked workspace.  Old hardware, bones, and other assorted odds and ends fill the various containers on a series of battered steel shelves.  One wall is covered in iron hooks used to store a diverse array of crafting materials.  Haphazardly stacked in one corner, a pile of reclaimed wood is fraught with exposed, rusty nails.  Across from a patchwork curtain, tools and half-finished projects litter the surface of a paint-splashed workbench."
