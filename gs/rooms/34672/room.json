      "The railing of the upper balcony on a nearby manor house dangles a single scarlet kerchief that matches the dwelling's red-limned door.  Heavy velvet curtains shroud the windows and those of the carriages parked in its courtyard.  Opposite the manse is a large open-air theater with a thatched roof over its circumference.  Lampposts stand to either side of the path leading to the playhouse."
