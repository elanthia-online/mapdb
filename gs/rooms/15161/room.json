      "Enclosed by varnished ebonwood walls, the shop features a large potted fern in the center of its black marble floor.  An intricate knot-worked wall-hanging hangs under the vaulted ceiling.  Right near the front is an intricately carved ebonwood stand and an oval-shaped speckled marble counter."
