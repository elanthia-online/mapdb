      "Foul water drips steadily from the ceiling, carrying the faint decaying smells of whatever has been buried in the dirt above.  The passage narrows to the west and opens to a wider area to the east, though the way is nearly blocked by a curtain of heavy spiderwebs that move faintly in the damp wafts of air that circulate through the tunnels."
