      "Grey and gold-veined marble sprawl across the floor, the highly polished surface reflecting the sunlight that spills through the glass windows at the base of the pendentive dome above.  Golden linden inlay at the heart of the floor creates a compass rose that is wreathed by calligraphed words.  Limestone pillars, in groups of three, rise from the eight points of the pentagonal room, each group supporting arches over the branching hallways."
