      "This room is suffused with the smells of sausages, herbs and meats that hang among the cooking utensils along the low ceiling.  Lining one wall is a long wooden counter fronted by several bar stools, and against the other is an icebox, cooled by circulating brine siphoned in from the chilly waters of the Bay.  A golden baker's rack adorns the wall next to the icebox."
