      "Brightly illuminated by polished brass sconces that are evenly spaced upon the crimson and ebon bourde walls, the entry is carpeted with a deep burgundy rug that muffles all sound.  Flanked on the eastern wall by a lacquered ebonwood archway and the western by glass-paned doors, a flight of broad mahogany stairs ascends to the second floor and is decorated with carved balusters."
