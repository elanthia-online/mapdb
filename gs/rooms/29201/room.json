      "Halfway between the short pilings at the pier's entrance and the tall ones near the water's edge, this spacious area has overhead room to spare.  Bamboo-mounted torches stand ready to illuminate the area come nightfall, and several dormant firepits dot the sand.  Large, dark-grained rocks seem custom placed for seating and gathered piles of driftwood provide a ready source of fuel."
