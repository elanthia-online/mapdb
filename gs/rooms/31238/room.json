      "Gilded vines burgeoning with sharp-tipped thorns wend through the burgundy damask rose pattern of the silk-paneled walls.  Luxurious walkways lined with wildflower tapestries cut paths throughout the spacious wagon, stopping only before a spade-footed vaalin and onyx carousel and a two-tiered woven linden branch rack.  The gleaming lacewood floors extend up the back wall in the form of a luminous, wide-framed bay window."
