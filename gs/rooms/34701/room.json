    "description": [
      "Wild firethorn and black violets grow in profusion before the temple in untamed banks, their blossoms mimicking the colors of the red-veined black stone construction.  Twin braziers of crude black steel flank the entrance, adorned with a pattern of interlocking swords.  They fill the air with biting, dancing cinders and a wash of prickling heat.  A mighty henge of grey stone rings the temple grounds, and daylight filters cruelly between the great monoliths."
