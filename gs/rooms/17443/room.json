      "With hands on hips and decked out from head to toe in a red and blue plaid kilt, hat, and scarf, a faceless mannequin stands near the door of a red-thatched cottage.  Clusters of blue, red, and black trafel mushrooms crowd together between the feet of the dummy.  White smoke wafts through the chimney hole on the roof of the hut, where a wooden female figurine wears bulky skirts.  She looms above the smokestack with a ladle, as if stirring a huge cauldron."
