      "Thick plush rugs cushion the footfall of shoppers in this cozy canvas pavilion.  A multicolored assortment of stained glass lanterns illuminate the shop's wares with a warm welcoming glow.  Cyan-orange ombre banners decorate the ceiling and walls, their gradient artfully mimicking an early evening sunset.  In one corner, a simple arch is roped off."
