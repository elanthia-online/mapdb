      "Here a few of the perfectly fitted granite blocks of the crypt have been chipped away flake by flake over the ages by persistent forces.  Brownish mosses and powdery lichen have taken hold in the crannies, further weakening the stone.  The sharp bits of stone are scattered over the blunter pebbles of the path."
