      "[A Tranquil Tent]"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Violet marbrinus silk walls are veined with pale grey whorls and anchored to white lattice supports to create a large, airy tent that is infused with the scents of lemongrass, sage, and jasmine.  Lined along one wall is a series of quilted sleeping pallets decorated in bright tropical hues.  Several bins, each labeled with a tiny plaque, are arranged near a cord-tied central flap, which leads outward, and the center of the room houses a low table ringed by cushions.  A brazier upon the table burns dried leaves."
