      "The Guild Hall's office is a roomy chamber paneled and furnished in gleaming mahogany.  Bright tones woven into the intricacies of an antique Illistim area rug enliven the dark wood, providing an attractive color contrast.  Where bookshelves filled with manuscripts don't claim the wall space, a number of beautiful lutes are hung from hooks made especially for the purpose, much like paintings would be displayed in other establishments."
