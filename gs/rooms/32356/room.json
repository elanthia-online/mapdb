      "A sense of great age pervades the wood and steel working desperately to hold the pier together against the restless thrashing of the cold tide.  The visible nails are pocked with corrosion where they have not surrendered to rust.  Creaking and groaning, the pilings sway with the ebb and flow of the water.",
      "The wood of the westernmost pier has silvered unevenly, leaving a strange stripe pattern in the warped planks as they alternate between grey and black.  The nails securing the planks are spotted with rust that makes each look as if it sits in a pool of old dried blood.  Traceries of rime glisten from the wood, lending a glint of natural beauty to the manmade decay."
