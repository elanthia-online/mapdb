    "description": [
      "The trail splits, each branch offering an opposite perambulation of the pond.  Halflings saunter by on their short legs, calling greetings to the open windows of houses as they pass.  A gaggle of ducks is clustered on the grassy bank of the pond.  The birds waddle in and out of the water, intent upon duckish pursuits.  One brown duck guards a little cluster of ducklings, and the chicks' adamant pips constantly harangue the mother."
