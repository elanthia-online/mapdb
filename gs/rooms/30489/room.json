      "Eddies swirl about the teeth-like basalt rocks rising from the depths of the ocean, the water foamy and green.  The only sign of the island visible, the distant lighthouse offers little safety this close to the \"Teeth,\" which are so tall that the wind whistles around them in a harrowing wail."
