      "Earthy rocks and rubble carpet the floor of this room, accenting the dark grey marble flooring with a layer of brown.  Crags and caves dot the roughly hewn walls giving the appearance of being carved directly out of the rock.  The focal point of the room is an enormous mithril vehicle, the floor around it littered with broken boulders and dirt.  On top of a particularly wide stone, a glass cover protects an artifact resting there."
