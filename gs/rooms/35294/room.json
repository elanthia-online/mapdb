      "Flung wide to admit the cool night air, the surrounding windows are devoid of glass, allowing the silvery starlight to slant across the ebonwood floorboards in long bands of luminous light.  Blown glass orbs collect in the ceiling and are arranged in celestial patterns, their soft glow illuminating a serving counter and silver-handled dark oak armoires.  Soft whispers fill the air as white-robed acolytes provide blessings to those that visit."
