      "A marble arch leads further westward, its deep black surface polished to a lustrous shine and topped with a large lion cast from gold, its mouth open in a proud, eternal roar.  Thick knotwork patterns of the same bright hue run down along the borders of the handsome structure, stopping at its base.  Three circular mosaics adorn the floor, depicting eagles in flight, warhorses, and stags in strong, vibrant colors."
