      "Bottles and apparati lie scattered around a bronze-caged lamp on the open lid of a pebbled leather trunk, its sisken-lined interior brimming with twine-tied scrolls.  Flicking orange light brings a warm shine to the plush bear hide rug softening the solid cedar floor.  Secured with two worn suede straps, a thin bedroll tilts against the back corner beside a scarred cordovan pack.  An undyed flax curtain, left partially open, evenly divides the lean-to and affords a modicum of privacy."
