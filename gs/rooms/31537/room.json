      "Apparently a central hub, several passages lead away from this circular room.  A pale screen of light spans each of the chamber's exits bar one.  Devoid of any other adornment, the smooth alabaster stone walls seem to shimmer and move as the light from a column of energy twists and turns on itself.",

Devoid of any other adornment, the smooth alabaster stone walls seem to shimmer and move as the light from a column of energy twists and turns on itself.Grand tapestries cover the walls of the chamber.  Their bright colors of the fabric create a sharp contrast to the pale stone.  A pair of cushioned benches flank some double mistwood doors whose silver hue is accented by wrought iron fixtures.Skylights fitted with crystal panes allow the pale moonlight to fill the entryway of the academy.  A multi-hued carpet covers the floor, its dark patterned material creates a sharp contrast to the silvery white stone floor.  While this chamber is obviously a foyer, no exit door can be found, only a small hallway leads out into the rest of the building.Apparently a central hub, several passages lead away from this circular room.
