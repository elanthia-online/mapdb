      "Plush velvet curtains are pulled back to reveal floor-to-ceiling windows of sparkling glass, golden sunlight spilling through the panes onto polished hardwood floors.  Arranged atop a gleaming cherrywood counter, a gilded vase filled with deep pink peonies looms over a sleek jewelry tray crowded with a selection of wares.  An assortment of parchment-wrapped parcels are stacked neatly on an ivory-topped table next to an elaborate gilt-stringed harp, its fireleaf pillar carved to resemble a wood sprite."
