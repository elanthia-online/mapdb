      "A fine mist keeps the air cool and damp, while water glistens on the rock walls of this small cave behind the falls.  Water roils from the force of the falls where the cavern floor meets the pool.  Nature has left handholds and rock steps on both the eastern and western faces of the cave, making it possible to climb in and out of here without difficulty.  Gazing out at the falls, moonlight creates a crystalline curtain of water.",
