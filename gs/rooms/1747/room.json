    "description": [
      "The valley continues monotonously to the north and south, although with a slight cant to the northeast and southwest.  On either side the DragonSpine Mountains press up against the sky.  Their sharp, cold peaks rise steeply, giving no indication of a way to pass through them.  It is entirely plausible that they have stood this way for hundreds of centuries as protective sentinels hemming in this desolate valley."
