      "The path is marked only by the twin, parallel tracts that run its length, each worn down to dirt through an age of fallen leaf cover by what might have been a cart or wagon.  Stones are arranged at each joint of the split rail fence that zig-zags its way alongside, each of the mounds adorned with both bright and newly fallen foliage and old and decaying leaves.  Hemmed in by the fence, brightly colored trees press in on both sides and oversee a stream that meanders down the incline of the hill."
