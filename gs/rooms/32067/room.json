      "Stellate blooms match the tint of the cerulean haze enveloping their aculeate, royal blue stems, which branch into fuzzy curls tipped with burgeoning buds.  Curving around exposed chunks of slate, the trail travels past the prickly plants.  Love-in-a-mist grows rampantly in a cloud of fractal foliage, their cobalt blooms centered with tentacle-like stamen clusters."
