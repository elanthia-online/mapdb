    "description": [
      "A narrow sandy beach quickly gives way to throngs of trees at the eastern edge of the swimming hole, while the southern shore is dotted with fragmented boulders, rock slabs, and gravel.  Though shallower here than at the center of the pool, the water is still deep enough for swimming, with a few sections suitable for wading.  Gazing northwest, intermittent shifts of wind create gaps in the waterfall's screen, revealing a hollow in the cliff wall behind the deluge."
