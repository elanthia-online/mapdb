      "The broad sweep of the planked floor is interrupted by a braided seagrass rug.  Halfway to the stucco ceiling, a tattered pirate flag hangs on one of the textured sandstone walls.  A torn sailcloth hammock and some stained driftwood shelves are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
