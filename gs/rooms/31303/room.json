      "Buzzing fills the hollow interior of this massive mistwood tree.  The occasional bee flits past you, gone in an instant as it heads up from a rabble of the tiny creatures defensively swarming the entrance from intrusion.  Gnarled growths along the walls form a series of narrow ledges that ascend into a massive honeycomb hive covered in busy worker drones."
