      "Reclining beneath a large section of burgundy awning, a bored and lanky bodach makes lackluster attempts to draw customers to his game.  An arrangement of fletched darts rests upon a rough clapboard counter that creates a barrier between the walking space and a large colorful gaming board.  Faintly flickering lights draw attention to luminaries hung in the trees beyond the field."
