      "Twine-strung crystals wind around one sailless mast and then another, bathing the mistwood deck in a cool glow as they swoop down to catch on a brass-cast, segreant wyvern figurehead.  Painted a muted ocean blue hue, slatted chairs look out to the misted sea, arranged alongside a marlin-carved chest on the firepit-inset foredeck.  Twin stairs with curved, glimaergless-inlaid railings ascend on either side of a cabin featuring stained glass windows in a coastal motif."
