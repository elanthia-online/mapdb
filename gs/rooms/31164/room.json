      "Sheet moss gives way to blue-green tufted grass as several pathways meet upon either side of an enormous weeping willow that grows upon the edge of a small pond.  Peat moss fills the air with its rich, loamy fragrance, while bright purple mountain laurel stretches lazily to one side of the northern pathway.  A trio of smooth boulders, free of moss and lichen, rest within the shelter of the willow's limbs."
