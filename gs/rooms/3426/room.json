      "Practical, as are most halfling institutions, the entry leads straight into the bar of the Thirsty Penguin Tavern.  A glittering bead curtain hangs off to one side, swinging lazily each time someone passes through it.  The entire wall behind the bar is studded with small, polished bronze mirrors."
