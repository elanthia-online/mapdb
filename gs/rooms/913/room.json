      "Running tightly along the edge of the rugged, pocked walls of the large cavern, the stone ledge makes for uneven footing in its best places.  Glazed with condensation from the careening water on the other side of the pit, the surface of the ledge must be meticulously navigated, each footstep carefully placed to avoid slipping into the wet abyss below."
