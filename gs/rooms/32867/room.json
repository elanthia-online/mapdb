      "Raw hoarbeam timbers, glinting with cold veins of glacial blue and shining silver, line the lower half of the shop's dark stone walls.  They curve to frame a wide stone hearth, within which a roaring fire crackles invitingly.  Opposite the hearth, a burled pine countertop with scrimshawed ivory inlay separates a cozy nook from the rest of the shop.  Shelves line the walls behind the counter, holding various staples in neat glass jars."
