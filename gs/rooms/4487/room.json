      "Despite the lack of bright light, leaning wooden bins and dark metal bins are clearly heaped with armor, which are obviously the source of the strong aroma of leather that permeates the narrow area.  On each wall, tapestries depict dwarves preparing and tanning skins, and further scenes show them cutting, shaping, embellishing, and ultimately finishing off suits of leather armor."
