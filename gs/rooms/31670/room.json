      "Curling sharply northward, the stream disappears beneath a rocky outcropping topped by an elaborate effigy constructed of deep plum-hued woods and inlays of cobalt-laced deep magenta everine.  The formation's topping lintel is crescent-shaped, points upturned, while the cross beams and vertical supports are spiral-carved and engraved with sigils.  One branch of the path follows the disappearing stream northeast, while the other continues southeast."
