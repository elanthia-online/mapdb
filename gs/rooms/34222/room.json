      "Luminous clusters of crystal pulse from the ground and walls, illuminating colossal geodes studding the walls.  The gems reflect the glow in a symphony of prismatic hues, illuminating the pathway in surges of light that reveal a fine blanket of crystalline dust.  It leads toward a great mineral column sprouting from the craggy ground at the chamber's center, chips and chunks hacked out of its bulk suggesting recent efforts to harvest the formation."
