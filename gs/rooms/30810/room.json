      "A seated, cross-legged crewman dozes at the foot of the towering mast, shadowed by sail rippling in the constant seabreeze.  Far overhead, a tiny halfling clutching a brass spyglass in his teeth clambers up the rigging towards the crows nest for the next watch.  A wheel from the carriage underneath some cannons lies on the wide-planked deck, awaiting repairs."
