      "Constructed from frosted glass blocks, the interior of the wagon resembles an icy igloo.  Thick furs cover the floor in front of a small woodstove, the crackling fire within warming the air while giving off a crisp, smoky pine aroma.  A wooden rack stands next to a large iron hook sunk deep into the frosted glass block wall."
