      "Hiding among the lush transplanted tropical plants and prickly cactus are a wide variety of lizards.  Multiple species of iguanas, anoles, geckos and other reptiles scurry about, basking in the sun or munching on leaves and bugs.  They seem to have little fear of the two-legged creatures visiting their home, regarding you with a total lack of care."
