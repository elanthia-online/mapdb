      "A glassy sheet of ice slicks half of the cobblestone street.  On the north side of the encroaching glacier, a wide porch joins several homes carved into the ice, lights from within making the surrounding slope glow with golden hues.  Carvings decorate the lintels of the doors, and several houses display small ice statues on their roofs.  One yard sports a small snowman with a crooked carrot for a nose.",
