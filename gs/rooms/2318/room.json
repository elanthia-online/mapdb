      "A glassy sheet of ice slicks half of the cobblestone street.  Several homes on the north side are dug into the ice of the encroaching glacier, lights from within making the surrounding slope glow with golden hues.  Carvings decorate the lintels of the doors, and several houses display small ice statues on their roofs.  One yard sports a small snowman with a crooked carrot for a nose.",
