      "A tall window framed in mahogany knotwork offers a picturesque view of Icebriar Lake.  Polished oak planks span the floor, their waxy sheen catching the soft glow of lanterns along the paneled walls.  Hollow stumps repurposed as bins cradle bundled branches, while iron-banded cases display an assortment of containers.  The faint resinous scent of freshly cut wood drifts in through a black and red check-patterned curtain leading to the workroom."
