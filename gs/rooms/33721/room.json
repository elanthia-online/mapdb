      "Light streams in through a sweeping, curved window above a smooth driftwood seat tucked with colorful, palm-patterned silk pillows.  In the center, a large aquarium takes pride of place, its viewing enjoyed from several pale leather chairs and a low, sea glass-topped table arranged nearby.  A gauzy, ivory linen curtain is pulled to one side revealing a narrow opening in one wall, its surface washed in shades of pale blue and turquoise green."
