      "A circular market is surrounded by residences, shops and tents pitched in every available spot on the crowded paving stones.  The scents in the breeze are strong and varied, from coffee beans to flowers to livestock.  Chickens crow raucously from their wooden crates, and doves add their soft cooing to the cacophony.  Gaily striped pennants add color to the plaza, hanging from poles over the doors of homes and stores alike."
