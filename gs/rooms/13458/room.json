      "On the slope, the lane that meandered between the lowland dwellings has dwindled to a conservative path, though it is still paved with similar small stones.  The trees seem taller at this elevation, and pine trees begin to infiltrate the oaks and birches found down by Tyro Pond.  Dwellings have been built on the slopes, some braced with heavy pilings.  Many have wide decks made from timber planks, which offer superb panoramas of the treetops and moonlit pond in the valley below.",
