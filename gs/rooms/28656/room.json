      "A twisting staircase leads down into a stone-built underground chamber with a low, barrel-vaulted ceiling.  A series of pillars are paired two-by-two down its long, narrow length between which stand statues of Arkati and sepulchers of long-forgotten adventurers.  At the far end of the crypt is a deep pool sunk into the bare stone floor.  Candles set into an iron chandelier overhead cast a dim light through the steamy haze, illuminating a pair of oak benches and footlockers nearby."
