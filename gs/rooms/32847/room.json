      "A circular polished rosewood bar dominates the center of the room, flanked by low-backed leather and rosewood stools.  Opposite a gold-banded lapis velvet curtain leading out is a back-lit stained glass panel depicting the town of Cysaegir, and a steel-bound bristle dart board set with silver rings hangs on the wall to the right.  A recessed alcove to the left of the panel is covered by a gold-threaded white flyrsilk curtain."
