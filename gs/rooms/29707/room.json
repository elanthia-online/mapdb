      "Lengths of wool hanging from the support beams above separate the large tent into several sections.  A makeshift floor of rough oak tiles covers the ground, creating an unorganized patterned floor.  Large window openings in the walls allow sunlight in to brighten the area.  Draped in plain burlap, a large archway is flanked by a pair of makeshift tables."
