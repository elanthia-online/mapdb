      "Sprawled out beyond the overlook is the edge of the town below and the whole of its accompanying graveyard.  Its dim and dark countenance seems a distant and curious reality from this point of view amid the brightly colored trees bedecked in their autumnal finery.  Back in the direction of the main path, the enigmatic but warm, gilded crimson illumination from the far side of the ridge beckons, while everything below remains shrouded in heavy mists and set against a twilight sky."
