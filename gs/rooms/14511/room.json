      "Two completely different landscapes are bisected by the winding zoo path, contained within thick iron fences.  A snowy hill stands behind a frozen field, the chill white terrain serving as a habitat for an arctic manticore.  Across the way, conifers intermingle with young yew and haon, while the distinctive sap of the tanik pervades the exquisite replica of the three-toed tegu's natural habitat.",
