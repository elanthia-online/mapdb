    "description": [
      "Except for the occasional moan or scream of agony from an adjacent sauna, few sounds pierce the silence in what could, at best, be called a large coffin.  Towering black wooden walls seem to push in from four sides, leaving barely enough room to turn around without hinderance.  The mild Elanith weather somehow feels much harsher here, with not even a hint of a breeze to help evaporate the sweat puddling on the floor.  Not surpisingly, the stench rivals that of a troll king in mid-summer."
