      "Slowly transitioning from a residential area to the south, the northern section of the avenue that follows the line of the Vornavis-Solhaven wall becomes less densely populated.  Lampposts are more prevalent amid the tidy storehouses and customs houses, which are surrounded by wagons in various stages of being loaded or unloaded.  A set of cobbled stairs rises towards the gated entry into the sister city."
