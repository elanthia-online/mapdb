      "Fingers of rime spread like a growth of moss along the wall, glistening like a dusting of diamond.  It clings to the edges of shelves full of disembodied skulls and glistens from the surfaces of coffins marching down the passageway.  The biting chill presses in from all around, amplified by the frozen earth surrounding the underground chamber."
