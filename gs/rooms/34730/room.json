      "Moss crawls up the facade of the library, tinging the grey stone blocks a verdant green.  Vines have grown into an arch over the entryway, which is lit from within by the glow of flames.  Above the zenith of the living arch, a stylized bronze book is set into the facade, watched over by a slit-pupiled eye.  Banks of sage to either side of the flagstone walkway bake in the sun, filling the air with their dry, herbal aroma."
