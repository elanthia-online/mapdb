      "Cord-like vines dangle across the cinnamon bark path that winds its way through the verdant jungle.  Tiny streamlets slip across the crimson-colored ground, their crystal clear waters tugging at the shaggy bark pieces in an unsuccessful attempt to draw them towards the larger body of water that can be heard but not seen."
