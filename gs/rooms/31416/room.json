      "Hanging from the scuffed rafters of the bungalow are numerous, battle-themed origami figures, and origami paper is stacked along all the walls and under a sturdy cedar table.  A chipped iris agate case perches precariously along a blood red stack of paper, a dusty piece of parchment propped nearby."
