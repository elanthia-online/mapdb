      "A circular bar counter dominates the center of the parlor, its slate-topped surface polished to a high sheen.  Racks of wine bottles and empty glasses hangs above it, and a purple-haired elven barmaid offers an almost genuine half-smile to nearby patrons as she converses with them.  Several miniature pewter lions are positioned along a dark blue baystone mantle that stretches over a blackened stone fireplace.  Round tables and chairs provide seating throughout the edges of the room."
