Most of the trees are dead, their greyish trunks and skeletal branches standing out as pale shadows in the dim moonlight.  The remaining trees are mostly dead, their thin trunks splotched with disease and their limbs bearing only a few leaves.",
      "Rows of neatly organized fruit trees stand silently in this small orchard, their trunks lost behind a heavy growth of yellow-tipped grasses.  Most of the trees are dead, their greyish trunks and skeletal branches lending an air of gloom to the once-abundant field.  The remaining trees are mostly dead, their thin trunks splotched with disease and their limbs bearing only a few green leaves."
