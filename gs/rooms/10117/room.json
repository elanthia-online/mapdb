      "Finely-carved modwir posts support the weight of the fel boards that form the floor of the dock.  The boards are fastened securely to the posts with a thick rope twined between each board.  The gentle sway of the dock causes a light creaking sound as the waves brush against the posts.  A cobblestone path leads away from the dock back towards the village."
