      "By the cracked stone bordering a blood-filled sinkhole awaits an arranged pile of corpses, from dusty skeletons to empty-eyed cadavers.  The grotesquerie is arranged in a horrific spiral that seems to hold neither purpose nor meaning.  Slick and tacky, the cavern floor is a spectacle of clotting red muck."
