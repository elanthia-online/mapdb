      "The floor and walls of this bare landing are blackened and rippled, as though they had been subjected to intense heat.  A small window with half-melted edges looks out onto the jetty and back towards the eastern crossing.",
      "The walls of this bare landing appear to be made of living flesh, each one slightly discolored and shifting ever so slightly.  Rivulets of blood drip up, not down the walls, slowly oozing through crevices along the surface of the patchwork walls of flesh."
