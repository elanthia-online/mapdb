      "Gleaming in the ambient lighting, white travertine pillars support the dock's weathered wooden planks.  At regular intervals, wooden benches are attached to the pillars, offering a place to sit and enjoy the view.  The air is filled with the scent of salt and seaweed, mingling with the faint aroma of fresh fish."
