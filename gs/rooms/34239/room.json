      "Colder than the surrounding chambers and corridors, the oblong hollow stinks of death.  Bodies, more than a few of them humanoid, lie in grisly heaps, crammed carelessly into alcoves along the walls.  There is a mindlessness to the storage that suggests a singular lack of concern for the dead."
