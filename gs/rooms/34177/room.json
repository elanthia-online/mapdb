      "The winding tunnel is graced by the faintest of luminescence from fungi thriving in crags and crevices.  Moisture beads on the black granite as if the walls of the tunnelway were sweating.  The water droplets trickle down the walls' ragged faces, collecting in little pools that have a strong mineral odor.  A faint thrum through the surrounding stone makes the pools' surfaces ripple and dance."
