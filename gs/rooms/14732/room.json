      "Thick tiles of square glaes form a straight line along the middle of the floor here, a dark red glow emanating from the lava that flows within the channel.  Waves of vaporous heat blur the air slightly, the temperature almost too much to bear in this slightly cramped hall.  Slabs of iron sit reverently in small shelves carved into the rock, along with various other metals of different make and hue."
