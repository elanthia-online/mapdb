      "Culminating in a rough stone wall, the corridor stretches to the south under the watchful gaze of wrought iron lanterns.  Smooth mahogany floors are polished to a high glossiness that reflects and defuses the resulting pools of light.  In the eastern and western walls, a pair of doors, a polished oak door etched with a sea hag and a polished oak door etched with a kelpie, provide entrance to the workrooms beyond."
