      "Sunlight reflects off of the red clay roof tiles atop several buildings in the town below the cliff side trail.  Shoppers scurry through the cobblestone streets, though from this height, most look to be halflings.  The trail, though narrow, is at least more level here than on the craggier faces directly above.",
      "Silvery bands of moonlight reflect off of the red clay roof tiles atop several buildings in the town below the cliff side trail.  A few tavern-goers and late night revelers wander the cobblestone streets, though from this height, most look to be halflings.  The darkened trail, though narrow, is at least more level here than on the craggier faces directly above."
