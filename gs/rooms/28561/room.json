      "Dim lighting illuminates this sizable hold filled to the roof with crates of questionable contents.  The musty scent of old leather mingles with the brine of salt water in the still air.  While the cramped area is crowded with junk, the footing remains clear and steady.  A narrow aisle weaves its way through the maze of crates towards the forehold, and a hatch overhead provides a means to return to the fresh air and deck above."
