      "A wire-bound mobile tilts above a green-lacquered crib of sturdy wood, the device suspending decapitated wool avians and mammals above a flora-stitched pillow stained in ichor.  Nestled between twin beds curtained in fine linen is a faded dollhouse, the ebonwood table below it strewn with minute pieces of broken furniture and porcelain body parts, some crushed into the wood.  Various toys are scattered across the sigil-woven rug, some emanating a dull red glow which changes in the ambient light."
