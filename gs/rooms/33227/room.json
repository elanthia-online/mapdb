      "White dryad hedges grow along the high iron fence enclosing the courtyard, which is paved with cobblestones.  Flying a silk pennant emblazoned with a charging mule, a low-roofed stone guard post stands toward the rear of the courtyard.  A lone training dummy of sackcloth, propped up by a spruce stake, stands near to the entrance.  It looks like it has endured more than a few beatings."
