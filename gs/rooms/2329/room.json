      "An unlit street light casts its shadow down the drive of a freshly built house, the construction new enough that boards and buckets of nails clutter the street before it.  Several weary-looking krolvin and halflings sit together near the entrance, their hair dusted with wood shavings and their clothing spotted with paint.  Lamp posts follow the winding lane, their wrought iron bases detailed with fanciful sculptings of musicians and dancers.",
      "A crew of halflings is building a house off to the side of the road, filling the air with banging and cheerful banter.  You are forced to step over the boards and buckets of nails that line the street and you must constantly shake wood shavings from your hair.  Examining the chaos the building has created, you briefly wonder how anything gets done here.",
