      "Lanternlight spills across the corridor, flickering as the wind stirs ribbons wrapped around nearby pillars.  To the west, a dirt clearing meets the road beyond, where the last travelers pass in quiet footsteps.  A vendor tends to a wooden stall stacked with bundles of dried herbs, their faint fragrance rising in the night air.  Eastward, marble and ceramic tiles meet in an open-air courtyard, where the steady trickle of water echoes softly, its rippling surface reflecting the glow of scattered firelight."
