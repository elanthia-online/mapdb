      "A small sheltered granite alcove hugs this side of the lake.  The western side is open to afford a colorful view of the lake's crystal blue waters.  Shelves, desks and small brass lanterns occupy the rest of the area.  The shelves are crammed full of parchments, books and scrolls.  Interestingly, the majority of the writings address the honing of one's will, meditation, martial arts and weaponry rather than healing arts.  The sandy floor effectively muffles the sound of passing footsteps."
