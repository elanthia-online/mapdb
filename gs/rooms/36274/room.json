      "Brightly lit by polished wall-mounted sconces, the study is paneled in dark-hued walnut, providing the expansive chamber with a tranquil atmosphere.  Sturdy bookcases overflowing with collections of tomes, ledgers and books line the perimeter of the room like stalwart sentinels.  A long central conference table stretches across the carpeted floor, its surface cluttered with various maps of Wehnimer's Landing and the outlying environs."
