      "Cupboards, shelves, and a large dust bin stand somewhat jumbled together around a wooden broom closet in this small space.  Although lit by a single coal-filled brazier set behind the counter, the room is cheery-looking, with several paintings of happy, firelit gatherings adorning the limited wallspace."
