      "The surface of the disc is marred by deeply etched runes, the edges of which are rough and imprecise.  Pallid light bleeds from their edges like blood from a gouge, leaching color from the surroundings.  Fragments of broken rock litter the area, their edges fitfully illuminated by the same glow.  No signs of tools, even makeshift ones, necessary to cause such damage are left behind."
