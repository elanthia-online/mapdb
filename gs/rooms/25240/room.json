      "Looming friezes of men and women with heavily scaled faces stare down from the high walls.  They are accompanied by writhing creatures of grey countenance and bent posture, portrayed with horrible eyes of flashing gemstone.  The walls curve overhead to form an arched ceiling, luminous soulstones suspended from swinging chains at the zenith providing the only sickly light along the walkway."
