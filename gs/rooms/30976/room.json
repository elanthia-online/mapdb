      "Pale light from the moons streams through multi-paned windows flanking the shop's ash-framed doorway, washing the shop in a gentle glow.  Large, circular polished hoops of white macrame alternate between unlit oil sconces, partially obscuring pine walls.  Several piles of neatly stacked woods litter the floors, with one serving as a makeshift pedestal.  Just out of the way, in a far corner of the room, rests a mahogany-framed sign hanging above a well-tended hole."
