    "description": [
      "Huge, bevelled panes of colorless glaes replace the hull timbers to either side of the keel.  From the deck planking to the deck beams above, the ship's bow is a giant window opening on the world beneath the waves.  Several small driftwood tables are scattered about the room.  Atop each is a green glaes-shaded oil lamp which casts a dim light, giving the room the illusion of being an extension of the realm beyond the panel.  Set in the wall near the driftwood bar is a glaes-topped driftwood bar."
