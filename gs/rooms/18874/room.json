    "description": [
      "The soft light in this study faintly illuminates a large coiled golden serpent that has been inlaid into the grey slate floor.  The serpent spirals gently inward from corner to corner, its massive head rising from the floor in the center of the room to provide a suitable base for a black glaes-topped worktable.  A small stone fireplace is set into the far wall of the study, surrounded by comfortable leather chairs and ottomans, and a crystal globe stands in the far corner."
