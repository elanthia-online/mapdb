      "Providing an encompassing glimpse of the area from this lofty vantage point, it is obvious that both moonlight and moisture are able to infiltrate the cavern given the glistening rock walls and the resulting performance of twinkles that dance around the black abyss.  In addition to the ramshackle connectors, a dark tunnel, with disembodied howls emerging from its opening, begs investigation.  A tiny trickle of water flows down the slick granite wall, easily overlooked if not for a small puddle directly beneath."
