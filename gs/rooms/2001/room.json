      "A low hill ushers the thickest of the fog to lower ground, and for once visibility extends more than a few feet.  Great mistwoods crowd the forest, always in constant contact through their crossing limbs and the vines that drape from them.  Huge leafy ferns grow in the darkness beneath the trees, their fronds, while not quite so wide as the largest of the mistwoods' leaves, are often a few feet across.",
      "A low hill leaves the thickest of the mist below, and for once one can see more than a few hundred feet.  Great mistwoods crowd the slopes, always in constant contact through their crossing limbs and the vines that drape from them.  Huge leafy ferns grow in the shade of the trees, their fronds, while not quite so wide as the biggest rubbery leaves of the mistwoods, are often a few feet across."
