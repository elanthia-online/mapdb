      "This chamber is small, but comfortable.  A high, wood-paneled bed stands in one corner, its shape reminiscent of a seafaring captain's bunk.  A small writing desk stands against the other wall -- a few papers, an old quill pen and a few other odds and ends lying on it.  A tawny humpbacked puma fur hangs on the wall."
