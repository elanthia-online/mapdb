      "What little moonlight makes it through the thick canopy of leaves flashes on the shock white gills of fungi crowding the gnarled roots of the various trees.  Dried and decaying foliage carpets the ground, rustled by ringtailed possums searching for tender shoots.  The echoing hoot of a lone owl sounds from somewhere overhead.",
      "Growing amid the tangled roots of the crowded trees are fungi of various hues ranging from a lilac-blue to pale tan to deep reddish brown.  Some of them flash shock white gills while others sport dark brown concentric rings on their caps.  Cinnamon ferns take advantage of the humid growing conditions and clump together in small groupings."
