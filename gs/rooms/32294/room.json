      "Tall lancet windows valanced in silvery organza swag grace the front of the exhibition area on either side of some mistwood doors paneled with ornate floriation.  Pristine white floors of decoratively misshapen tile give way to sapphire-padded chairs in rows before a lacquered mahogany lectern facing the entry.  Artwork decorates the whitewashed side walls and nearby floorspace, each socle guarded by gilt stanchions with cobalt velvet ropes that match the draped partitions.  At the far end, a white linen-draped buffet stands near the eastern archway leading toward a rotunda."
