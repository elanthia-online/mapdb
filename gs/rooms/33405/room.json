      "Foggy quartz orbs caged in nautilus-cut vaalorn hang in a neat row over an expansive, mist grey lasimor bar lined with low-backed leather stools.  On the other side, the mirrored back wall reflects the framed technical ship plans occupying the space between brass-rimmed portholes, offering circular glimpses of the moonlit seascape.  Dark-stained planks enclose the spacious underdeck, the far end adorned with a tri-toned dart board beside a mistwood rack."
