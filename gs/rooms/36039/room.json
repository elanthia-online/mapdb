      "Strands of tiny square mirrors hang from the narrow rafters, their beveled edges scattering the roof ring's light into rainbow-limned patterns across the latticed khana.  A polished birch table stands behind the central hearth, its ornamental tapestry worked in dense embroidery of interlinked geometrics.  Atop a goat hide rug of curly wool, a multi-pronged stand spreads its feet and gleams with an assortment of rings."
