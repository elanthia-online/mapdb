      "Paired off marble pillars line each side of a long central hall that runs down the entire length of the building.  Here and there, a pillar has toppled, joining the bits and pieces of beams that are all that remain of a tile roof long collapsed and ground into dust on the ground.  Hardy vines of ivy coil up every pillar and creep like a green carpet across the stone slab floor.  A particularly heavy curtain of vines extends across the southern wall of the hall."
