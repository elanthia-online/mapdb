      "A small clearing opens up deep inside the orchard.  In the center of the clearing sits a massive apple tree, its darkened branches covering several of the surrounding trees.  The twisting boughs and gnarled trunk of the tree look like they were formed by the hand of an evil giant, and a sense of brooding seeps from its shadowy depths."
