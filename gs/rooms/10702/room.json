      "An elaborate gate made of bone is set into the outer wall.  Now sealed by a fused lock, the gate looks out on a short path leading to a now collapsed bridge.  The water quickens through the smaller channel formed by the bridge remains.  Moonlight filters through the gate, casting a shadowy image of the gate on the grey ground.",
