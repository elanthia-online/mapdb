      "Decaying garlands of ichor-covered flora drape from each of the four houses sitting at the foot of the hill, the strands dangling at intermittent lengths before drooping into the puddles of brackish water filling the holes dipping in the dry grass.  Flashes of fur dart between the homes, skittering off into the shadowed recesses through the open doors."
