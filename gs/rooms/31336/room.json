      "Large fern plants and draped vines with fan-like leaves spread across this section of the pavilion.  The thick foliage creates a dense curtain of humidity, the pressure weighing heavily with each breath.  Mist burbles outwards from within this man-made jungle, creating a dense haze across the ground.  Cutting through the dark plant coverage, the form of a white to grey peahen can be seen, the avian poised protectively by a large nest."
