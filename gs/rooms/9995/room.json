      "[Ravine, A Small Cave]"
    ],
    "description": [
      "The old marks of axes and chisels are visible on the stone walls and ceiling of the small cave, which has been shaped into a crude but almost circular dome.  A low stone slab, roughly cut into a door-sized rectangle, rests against the far wall, its surface dotted with the long-dried wax and soot of burnt candles and torches.  Any adornment the altar once bore has been long since stolen away, and all that remains of the primitive shrine are the broad strokes of lichen-faded paintings on the stone."
