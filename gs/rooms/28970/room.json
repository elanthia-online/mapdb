      "Light from a myriad of frosted wall sconces reflects off of the stucco walls of the courtroom, the steady glow creating a warm and brightly lit space.  Navy blue rugs rest against the eastern and western walls, pews stretched out upon their faces, while leaving a central aisle of exposed stone.  An enormous copper kraken sculpture dominates the northern wall, looming over several chairs that surround a copper-edged ironwood podium."
