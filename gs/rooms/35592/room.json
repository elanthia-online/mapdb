      "Dim lamplight from a scratched iron lantern casts wavering shadows across the hold, reflected in rippling puddles scattered across the deck.  Within a loose semicircle of crates and barrels, an unvarnished oak table holds brass scales, a chisel, and neat piles of coin.  Damp burlap sacks slump along the hull.  Most exhale a sweet-must aroma of spoiled grain, but a few clink tantalizingly with every pitch of the ship."
