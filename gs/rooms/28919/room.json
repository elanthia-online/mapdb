      "Rising dark and ominous into the sky, a large wooden guard tower overlooks the tapered points of the surrounding colony walls.  A hard-packed dirt road pushes through gates to the west, though it quickly turns to mud as it travels east.  Very little traffic makes its way through the town entry, which is bathed in bright starlight.  Cracked mud, soft and viscous at its center, fills the entry to a sprawling oak and pine barn that is built in the center of the lane.",
      "Casting its shadow upon the area, a large wooden guard tower rises above the tapered points of the surrounding colony walls.  A hard-packed dirt road pushes through gates to the west, though it quickly turns to mud as it travels east.  Steady traffic from loggers skidding their daily haul keeps the bustling town entry busy."
