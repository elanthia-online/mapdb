      "Hanging from a wooden arm above the tall double doors of a nearby shop, a white holly sign creaks in the restless wind howling down the way.  A small pathway of brightly colored gravel leads through the front gate, snaking past a few stunted alder trees.  Although the windows of the storefront are shuttered, periodic bursts of light shine through their wooden slats to illuminate the entire street.",
      "A small sign proclaims in bright letters that this is the home of Wurt the Amulet Maker.  A small gravel pathway leads through a wrought-iron gate to the tall double doors of the house.  The windows of the house are shuttered, but periodically a burst of light shines through their wooden slats and illuminates the entire street."
