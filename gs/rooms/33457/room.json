      "Two hand-painted porcelain urns flank each side of the boutique's entrance and are filled with bright, blooming peonies that complement the room's simple but elegant decor.  Floor-to-ceiling glass walls give an unhindered view of the adjacent exterior grounds, and a floral curtain with cutwork lace edging hangs over the backroom entry behind a tiered display counter."
