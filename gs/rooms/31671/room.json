      "Ending in a glade enclosed by will-o'-wisp-lit tree growth, the path opens into field carpeted with cobalt and lavender-hued grasses dotted with rings of spiraled rainbow-striped mushrooms.  In betwixt and in between are clusters of tiny auroral starflowers and glittering fairy's skirt mushrooms, and at the edge of the treeline, stalks of mistbloom and dreamphlox are backlit by a vibrant magenta glow that filters through the undergrowth."
