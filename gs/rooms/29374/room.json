    "description": [
      "The enclosing ebonwood walls bear a coat of matte lacquer, dulling the gloss to a subtle but refined sheen under the touch of flickering lantern light cast from behind cut glass shades.  Underfoot, plush plum carpeting quiets every footfall, and warped shafts of pale moonlight are painted across it by the whorled crystal windows set near the ceiling.  Between the windows hangs a wall-mounted velvet-lined case with a small parchment note attached, and beneath it is a finely scripted parchment sign in a silver frame."
