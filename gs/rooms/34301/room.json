      "Moisture clings to the verdant grass like glue, the large water droplets elongating past their limit before breaking away to merge with the constant rains.  Lightning strikes nearby, and a thunderous boom across the ridge sends a flurry of creatures running for cover.  Tilted slightly to the left, due largely to the sodden ground, is a handpainted sign that has obviously been repainted a number of times."
