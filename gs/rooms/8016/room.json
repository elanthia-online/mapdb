      "You are at the bottom of a steep slope in a relatively level area.  This is apparently where the actual mining is being done as there are stacked timbers and shoring beams and a good deal of other gear in crude but serviceable shape.  A pair of rails set into the floor must have provided some assistance for the laborers in the dim past, but are now so rusted and worn as to be beyond use."
