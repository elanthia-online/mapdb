      "An old elven war banner hangs on one of the ribbed black willow walls, and a vaulted ceiling rises overhead.  An oily black kraken statue sits in one corner of a speckled black marble floor.  There is an elegantly carved oak armoire on one side of the shop and a twisted dark metal rack on the other."
