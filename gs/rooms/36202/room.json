      "Panels of midnight blue wool run along each wall, gathered into thick drapes of fabric.  Bronze lanterns hang from the ridge and edges, while stacks of straw are arranged into simple seats along the sides, with a few loose bales scattered throughout.  An archway draped with a dark woven curtain rises along one wall."
