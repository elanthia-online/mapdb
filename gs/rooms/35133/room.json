      "Carved wooden figureheads are mounted to the walls of the hall near the base of the vaulted ceiling.  No two are precisely alike, having been carved from a variety of woods and in a range of styles, from exaggerated caricature to the astoundingly lifelike.  Pennants, tattered and sun-faded, hang among them, some scorched at the edges or sliced as if with blades."
