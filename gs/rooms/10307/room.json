      "A thick walnut lattice walkway extends in a diamond shape to the east.  Sturdy beams rise from the walkway to support a wide overhang that is an extension of the golden tile roof.  At each of the four points of the diamond, a walnut door allows entrance into one of The Legendary Rest's sleeping rooms.  The walls of the rooms touch, so the area is actually a diamond-shape, open to the sky, within a walnut-lined square, and the courtyard and fountain are easily viewed below."
