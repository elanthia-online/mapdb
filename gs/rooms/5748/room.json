    "description": [
      "Two attractive residential houses line the tunnel.  They are not quite 'houses,' though, but rather excellent depictions painted on the walls and timbers of the tunnel itself.  The only part that actually exists on most of the houses is the door.  A brownstone manor with a striped door painted in brilliant yellows and reds occupies the west wall, while a cozy ranch home with a faux-wood door spreads out along the east wall."
