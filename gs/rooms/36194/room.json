      "Loops of dried herbs and flora decorate the wooden framework of the shop, the fragrant bundles spaced between the iron-wrought lanterns set above several jadewood shelves.  Wood-carved piebald kozas frame either side of the elongated dark thuja counter, their wide horns enclosing small woven baskets of wool and grass."
