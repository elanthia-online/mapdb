      "Antique tapestries, edged with amber tassels, are carefully hung on the grey stone walls, their woven design displayed on polished brass rods.  The rich, pungent smell of tobacco permeates the air of the tiny shop.  A clear glass case stands center in the room, its interior filled with a variety of items.  Set into the back wall is a large archway curtained with thick velvet."
