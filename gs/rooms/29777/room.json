      "Rising through a perfect circle centered in the smooth, pale limestone floor is a wrought-iron spiral staircase.  Five tall arches support a colorful stained glass dome overhead.  Sunlight streaming through the multicolored shards creates a slowly moving collage on the stone below.  A tarnished brass telescope sits on the balcony that encircles the structure."
