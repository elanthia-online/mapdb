      "Amethyst silk walls mark the circumference of this circular room.  Dotted along the edge, a series of display containers offer up wares for perusal.  In between these, torches rest on twisted wire stands, the flames glittering off the items for sale, and a hanging wooden sign resides in a prominent location.  A silver-beaded curtain leads deeper into the tent, and the scent of flowers lingers in the air."
