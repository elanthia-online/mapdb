      "Star filled skies open above this square courtyard buttressed on either side by the colorful walls of neighboring structures.  Cobblestones circle outward from a central fountain, providing a paved surface between a beaded curtain and a wrought iron gate.  Dense foliage thrives in the corners of this secluded sanctuary."
