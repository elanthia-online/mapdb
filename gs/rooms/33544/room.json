      "Plush cushions and walls of forest-hued silks and satins combine to create a cozy and comfortable space behind a cedar and sapphire silk screen.  A stuffed silken mannequin sits in one corner atop a nautilus-patterned rug, and a cherrywood figure rests opposite, nestled between a long bamboo shelf and a tall dream agate pillar etched with lotus blossoms."
