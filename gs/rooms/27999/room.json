      "Shadows dance across the area as the edge of the aspen grove brushes against the rocky outcroppings to the west.  Several game trails wander off in various directions, their edges covered in snow and their centers slick with mud.  Standing out starkly amid the bright white trunks of the nearby trees, a small dark blue yurt sits back from the path and is surrounded by several rows of fluttering pennants."
