      "Tempered orbs of pale white light rest within the purple-frilled hearts of fuchsia hummingbird plants that grow within planters along the upper edges of the oblong room.  The soft illumination accents the natural bands of dark wood grain in the smooth walls, cascading off their lacquered surfaces and reflecting upon dozens of flower-laden urns set upon a springy moss floor.  Entwined chocolate vines darken the egress, their three-petalled blooms drawing fireflies to their nuclei."
