      "Cracked and charred logs set on top of each other line the walls, while the two stained glass windows are in perfect condition, like new.  Rays of colored moonlight stream in through the tinted panes of glass, dotting the charcoal surroundings with dim colors.  Most of the furniture in this small room is either ash or mostly destroyed by a fire."
