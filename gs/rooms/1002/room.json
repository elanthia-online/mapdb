    "description": [
      "The tunnel turns ever so slightly as it makes its way through this portion of the business district.  A wrought iron pole protrudes several feet out of the south wall, and a silvery metal key hangs from the pole.  Below the key, a heavy black door with several deadbolt locks allows entrance into the building.  A wide, unpainted, metal rollup door occupies the north wall.  The sound of many roltons bleating pathetically emanates from behind the door."
