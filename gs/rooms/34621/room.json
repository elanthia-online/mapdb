      "A riot of knotted silken scarves flaps in the breeze, suspended over the roadway from hooks on a pair of opposing limestone buildings.  As it winds to the southeast, the lane widens to accommodate a dazzling spectrum of stalls and pavilions that have joined the multifarious businesses huddling to either side of the path.  Carts creak along, but much of the traffic is on foot, clustering about roadside jongleurs and hoarse-voiced hawkers straining to be heard over the din."
