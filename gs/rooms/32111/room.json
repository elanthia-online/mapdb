      "A few guttering candles valiantly battle the subterranean gloom, their wan illumination casting peculiar shadows on the walls that appear to lurch drunkenly at the slightest hint of a draft.  Flanking a darkened passageway, a tatterdemalion statue of a one-winged fairy presents an outstretched tray for perusal, and a cracked marble sculpture of a kneeling sea nymph offers a peek into a lidless coffret on her lap."
