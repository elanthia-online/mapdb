      "Wayfarers transporting an exotic cornucopia of wares drift in from the port area, narrowing outside a set of towering rosewood gates that are flanked by wandering street vendors.  The wintry mix underfoot is trampled to icy slush on the silvered cobblestones that pave the way towards a lively marketplace bedecked in tiny, jewel-colored lights."
