      "Dusky rose gaura pays court to a spray of sunset-hued lantana as they chase each other around the homes that rest upon the northern side of the cobblestone road.  Warehouses keep their back to the small domestic-heavy road, their white stucco surfaces covered in creeping fig vines that flourish in both the heat and the shade the area provides.  An incredibly narrow alley skirts through structures to the north, providing a direct route to Comyner's Court."
