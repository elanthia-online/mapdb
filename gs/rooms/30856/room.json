      "Empty planter boxes are scattered about the platform, stone and driftwood tools resting in piles by each one.  Innumerable shells, not all native to the atoll, line the terrace's edges, arranged by color into a variety of symbols.  Affixed to a sturdy wooden pole, a pristine conch stands ready for use, pointing roughly northeast toward the majority of the ruins.",
      "Raised planter boxes void of soil are scattered throughout the platform, makeshift stone and driftwood tools placed by the edge of each.  A large conch sits on a stick, facing the rest of the ruins."
