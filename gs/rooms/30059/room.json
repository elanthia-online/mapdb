      "Much of the stonework comprising the southern portion of the fane's sprawling rooftop has collapsed into lower floors or the snowy earth far below.  What remains is a cracked precipice that juts out into the frigid air, a nauseating plummet to either side.  Below, the remains of several gigas and smaller robed humanoids lay amidst the wreckage, their limbs lolling at unnatural angles."
