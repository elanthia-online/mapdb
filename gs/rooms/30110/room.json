      "Bits of metal and piping are scattered about the small area making it difficult to walk.  Boxes, crates, and barrels of various sizes are overflowing with springs, coils, bolts, and screws.  Piles of unfinished projects are stacked around a small archway covered with a tattered blanket.  A large metal sign is propped up against the jumbled mess."
