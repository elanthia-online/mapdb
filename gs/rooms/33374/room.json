      "Mahogany-framed chairs of burnt crimson velvet are arranged before the silver-washed railing, their wyvern-carved legs resting against the marbled ivory floor.  Heavy curtains are draped across the ceiling-high windows, obscuring the light through layers of ivory-on-gold brocade,  the fabric pooling below a lacquered lasimor table affixed in the far corner.  A spherical eahnor lantern emanates a soft glow across the table's surface, providing a faint modicum of light."
