      "You walk along this torchlit corridor, climbing a few steps at regular intervals.  At the end of the passageway you look back, and realize you must be in the northwest tower.  There are two doors in this corrider.  A plain wooden door is distinguished by fine workmanship and a beautiful finish enhancing the pattern of the grain.  Further down the corrider is a black glaes door, gleaming from regular polishing."
