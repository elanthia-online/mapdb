      "The edge of the cliff looms just above you as you turn at this switchback.  The stream which flows along the road here falls from the cliff in a fine spray, coating the rocks nearby with a moist sheen.  The road leads up to the top of the cliff to the southwest, and down to the forest below, through a number of switchbacks, to the northwest."
