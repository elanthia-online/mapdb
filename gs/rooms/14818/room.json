      "A florid arch is flanked by a pair of topiary sculptures resembling standing hippopotami.  Bright pink roses are worked into the fringe of the tutus on the large animals, a whimsical take on their dexterity.  A great number of visitors pass through the archway, the white gravel path crunching loudly as the awestruck walk over it."
