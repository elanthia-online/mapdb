      "Glowing moss dangles in thick clumps from the iron-worked trellis overhead, though glimpses of the crystalline dome ceiling are visible through gaps in the vegetation.  Tables are occupied by bards in the midst of riveting stories, drinking songs, hilarious jokes, or friendly chatter, though all are neck deep in steins of ale and other strong spirits.  A balding dwarf serves up drinks from behind a polished brass and corestone bar."
