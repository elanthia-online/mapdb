      "Wrought iron lanterns sway overhead, the dancing flames casting light on a wooden chair positioned behind a wooden table, laden with charts, logbooks, and a tattered map.  A straw bed is made up beneath an expansive window, the view interrupted by a dangling rope with bucket in hand to clean the glass panes.  An elaborate astrolabe hangs on the wood-paneled wall near the door."
