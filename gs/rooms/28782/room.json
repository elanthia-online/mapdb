    "description": [
      "Icicles hanging from the eaves of the lodge catch the starlight and spark with rainbowed refractions that spill onto the surrounding snow in tiny pools of prismatic color.  The treeline presses in on the small sculpture garden, with only a knobby fence of varnished cedarwood standing ward between the cultivated land and the wilds beyond.  A grim ice statue stands near to a pine door leading back into the warmth of the lodge.  It depicts a halfling figure wreathed in sculpted flames."
