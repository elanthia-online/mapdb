      "An uncharacteristically cool breeze stirs the hundreds of honeysuckle blossoms which border this shady porch.  Slender columns of marble stand silent sentinel to the house beyond, marred only by great ribbons of vines which have wrapped firmly around their bases and gradually work their way upward.  One day, perhaps in the near future, this porch will be engulfed by the ravenous vegetation -- but for now, they provide a refreshing respite from the sultry temperatures outside.",
