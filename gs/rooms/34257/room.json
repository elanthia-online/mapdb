    "description": [
      "The spongiform stone of the bridge is the color of turmeric, and there is a pronounced tilt to its length that makes it difficult to traverse.  Its shadow spreads over a bubbling hot spring with a skim of outlandish color, strange pinks and pastel greens mingling with startling blues.  Clouds of vapor hang in unsavory shreds over the water, so thick as to be nearly opaque.  They carry a strong mineral smell that overpowers the acrid stench blanketing the basin."
