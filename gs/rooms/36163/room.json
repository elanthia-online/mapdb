      "A canopy of faceted crystal panes framed in a delicate latticework of perforated mithril braces encloses an alabaster terrace.  Hanging glimaerstones cast a warm glow upon a spidersilk hammock strung between two beams.  Nearby, a small pot-bellied stove is bookended between a pair of wingback chairs."
