      "Intricate knots bind the colorful roofing to the tree's limbs, while grommets, rope, and brass anchors bind the breeze-rippled walls in matching shades of red and yellow to the smooth oak platform that serves as the shop's floor.  Woven baskets, lashed plank shelves, and dangling carryalls house various sundries, while a smooth counter offers a comfortable and well-illuminated space for ordering."
