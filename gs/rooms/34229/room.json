      "Several strands of gossamer sway on the cool air currents near the edge of the rim, gleaming like spun glass.  Mineral deposits have formed waxy, spiraling columns that connect the overhanging ceiling with the uneven floor, framing glimpses of the monstrous crystal and bizarre plaza below as if they were images in a gallery.  Hot gusts of moisture-laden air churn up from the grotto below, laden with a sharp stink of vinegar."
