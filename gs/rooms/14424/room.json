      "Crushed white shells encircle an octagonal patio fashioned of dozens of bricks imprinted with the names of past donors to the zoo.  At the heart of the patio is an enormous bronze sculpture of a fiddler crab, a matching placard resting within the gaze of its beady eyes.  At the junction of the patio and the pathway, a brass-edged golden linden counter sells postcards that commemorate the visit.",
      "The plaintive noises of animals begging for food is punctuated by the shrill, delighted squeals of the youngsters playing with them in the petting zoo just beyond the gate.  Sunlight sparkles off an immense glaes dome that lies to the north.",
      "Occasionally a sleepy animal call can be heard from the simple petting zoo enclosure that lies just beyond the gate.  Moonlight gleams off an immense glaes dome that lies to the north."
