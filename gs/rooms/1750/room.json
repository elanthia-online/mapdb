      "South and northwest, the western DragonSpine Mountains follow the valley's side.  Snow has piled up against the slopes, and it often extends well into the valley, making passage colder and crunchier.  The snow is very dry, though, and it doesn't tend to stick to clothing, so walking through it is relatively easy except for those rare times when it happens to cover a deep hole.  The snow gets deeper the farther northwest one travels and shallower in the southern direction."
