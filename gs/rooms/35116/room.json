      "Shale chips landscape the ground of the sparring yard, the crunching gravel offering necessary purchase in the ice-slicked outdoors.  Rows of dummies made from sackcloth and wooden posts stand in formation near the arched double doors leading into the dormitory, but they are a motley crew, scored and pummeled by hits from training swords and even peppered with arrows.  Flapping blue banners fly from the dormitory, which encompasses the yard on three sides."
