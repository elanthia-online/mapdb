      "The ger's canvas is painted a bright vermillion lined with thin, silver-hued stripes that run the full length of the interior.  A series of circular targets dot the sloping canvas roof, all inlaid with painted-on crossed pairs of socks set in each target's middle.  Several larger targets line the floor, painted onto wooden planks set atop the dirt floor, with a red-painted furniture collection set atop them.  A small sign is placed before the collection of furniture."
