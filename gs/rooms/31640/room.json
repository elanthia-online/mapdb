      "A herd of wrought iron wrens form the chain-suspended chandelier hanging high above the checkered ebonwood and lasimor dining table, the small avians cradling half-melted tapers between their outstretched wings.  Carved wooden chairs padded in devore velvet sit scattered in disarray sit upon a bloodstained pashmina rug, the fabric shredded in thin uneven ribbons.  A wide ebonwood cabinet leans against the back wall, filled with a variety of instruments covered in ash and dust."
