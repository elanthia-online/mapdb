      "The cavern ends here at a glistening rocky wall.  Carved into the dark stone, a series of wide switchback steps winds upwards, wet from water that trickles down from above.  Small patches of deep red algae can be seen on the surface of some of the surrounding rocks, but they do not quite thrive in the cool, mineral scented air.  Darkness obscures what lies to the north."
