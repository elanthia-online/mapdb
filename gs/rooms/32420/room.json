      "To the south, the ground rises precipitously toward high hills whose black shadows stretch over the road, casting the area in darkness.  Flower beds full of night-blooming jasmine thrive in the gloom, filling the air with their cloying sweetness.  Sprawling across the highest hilltop is a castle of dark basalt.  Its soaring towers and vaulting walls are cut a severe silhouette against the blue of the sky."
