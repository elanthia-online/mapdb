      "Moist air laden with a mixture of rust, rot, and salt fills this section of the companionway.  A wide brush slathered with pitch lies on the floor next to a bucket of glossy black tar.  The ends of tar-soaked strips of oakum protrude from the hull where they have been crammed between planks, while even more gaps remain to be caulked."
