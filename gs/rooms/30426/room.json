      "Conical stalactites dimly glow with a faint greenish hue and have a sheen of water covering their rough surfaces.  Almost musical, the sound of the water dripping from the large rock formations echoes through the space.  Large and small puddles pock-mark the floor of the cave, whose southeastern edge drops off suddenly into a thin channel of water far below."
