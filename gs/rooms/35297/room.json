      "Starlight casts a silvery glow on an opulent bank's grand domed roof, emphasizing its elegant design and smooth curves.  Marble walls with golden accents give off a subtle glimmer as they reflect the light of nearby blown glass lanterns.  Whorled heather, kriti, sea spurge, and fan palms frame the building, their slender fronds and pale blossoms painted in gradient shades of silver and grey.  Broad marble steps, veined in gold and grey, proceed from the avenue up to the doors, which stand open and inviting."
