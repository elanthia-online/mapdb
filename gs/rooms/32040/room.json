      "Mushrooms soar to unnatural heights on either side of the rocky trail, an ethereal blue luminescence emanating from the gills of their colossal caps.  In unison, the glowing lamellae slowly pulse, occasionally blanketing the area in a darkness that heightens the treacherous nature of the terrain.  Oversized white lichen fans, cast with deep shadows, cling to the fungal stalks."
