      "Stretching from the tent's central post to its pewter-hued walls, royal blue and vermillion ribbons form decorative stripes upon the canvas.  Golden bows pull back the entrance, while ebony ones decorate the edges of the various tables that display their wares in the center of the tent.  Blown glass orbs top short wooden posts along the perimeter of the display area, their tops offering a soft light to see by."
