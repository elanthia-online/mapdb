      "Carved into a limestone cliff near a weald of giant tanik, the open archway from the rope bridge casts some light in this cave-like cookery.  Small epiphyte-filled niches add color and life to the pale walls, and a hanging pot between them holds a cascade of spidery brassavola orchids fragrant with a soft, citrusy scent.  Bamboo piping emerging from the far wall slides fresh water into a deep porcelain sink, and to its left is an iron-handled rhimar chest propped up on thin iron legs.  To the right is a tall, rectangular iron brazier partly inset within the wall, next to a curtained portal leading out to a sturdy deck-covered ledge and the forest."
