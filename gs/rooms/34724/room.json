      "Near to the garden's ornate entry gate stands a statue of a robed woman, her arm raised to hold a spread-winged owl aloft.  Her eyes look imperiously down upon a flagstone path that weaves through neatly tended banks of sage.  Beneath her shadow lazes a tranquil lotus pond alive with vibrant amber blooms, a veritable rainbow of koi swimming in the murky waters beneath."
