      "Rampant briars crisscross in arcs over the shrinking creek as it winds to the south, blocking the trail in that direction and suffocating the other plant life.  The lifeless remains of snapdragons sprout between the thorns in a failed attempt to escape their tangled prisons.  Dried conical inflorescences adorn the long stems, the clustered flowers redolent of miniature, dead-eyed skulls."
