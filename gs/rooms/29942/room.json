      "A hare's tracks dart across the feeble trail through the tangled briar, pursued by the footfalls of something much larger and more predatory.  Both sets of prints vanish into the bloodthirsty underbrush, which gleams threateningly from beneath its coat of glassy ice.  A few clumps of niveous fur suggest that the aggressor was a hungry canine."
