      "Shaded glimaerstone lamps illuminate the wood-paneled walls of the shop's back office, awakening reddish glints in the smooth ebony.  Behind an antique desk hangs a portrait in an elaborate gilded frame.  The canvas features an older man, his hair silvered at the temples, standing with a pomegranate in hand.  He is tall and raw-boned.  To either side of the portrait, cases hold tablets, daggers, and other artifacts of times past.  A burgundy rug softens the alternating wenge and white oak flooring."
