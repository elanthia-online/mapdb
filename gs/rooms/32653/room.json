      "A single, wide wave of shiny metallic sheeting protrudes from each of the four walls.  Nowhere on any of the sheeting is there a flat surface, and even the edges are carefully rounded and fluted so as not to create any right angles.  Similar metallic tabletops, generally circular in design but quite warped, sit atop individual twisted poles.  Small metallic instruments, quite unlike anything seen in any Elanthian eating establishment, are strewn across the sheeting and tabletops."
