      "The street runs between the northern palisade and the central square to the south and east.  The traffic is varied here, as a few traders and travelers mingle on the dark streets with the ever-present and watchful militiamen.  The damaged walls of Cholgar's Bathhouse occupy nearly the entire block.",
      "The street runs between the northern palisade and the central square to the south and east.  The traffic is varied here, as shoppers, traders, travelers and merchants mix with the ever-present and watchful militiamen.  Rowdy cries and raucous laughter, as well as some oddly unidentifiable sounds, emanate from behind the drawn curtains of Cholgar's Bathhouse, which occupies nearly the entire block.",
