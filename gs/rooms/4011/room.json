      "The cobblestoned walls have been painted a creamy eggshell and the curtains framing the glaesine windows are fashioned of the sheerest white gauze.  The shouts and chuckles coming from the kitchen indicate a large and lively group of cooks.  The heat of the ovens in the shop's back room blasts outward each time an employee enters and exits the swinging kitchen door.  A lovely glaesine case holds treats and sweetmeats of all types."
