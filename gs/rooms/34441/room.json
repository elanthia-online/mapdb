      "Heavy drapes frame two floor-to-ceiling windows along the western wall of the living space, while the eastern wall is dominated by a large riverstone fireplace with a dark walnut mantel.  Cozy armchairs and couches surround a low white birch table that rests upon a rich carpet of abstract designs.  Dominating the northern wall as it transitions into a small scullery, several pieces of framed artwork hang upon the wall above a rolltop mahogany desk and its matching chair."
