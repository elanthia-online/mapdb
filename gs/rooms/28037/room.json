      "Though clearly a makeshift setup in its underlying build, the open-air forging area is well-equipped, easily able to accommodate several blacksmiths at once.  The main hearth, which blazes with heat, is so large in scale that it is impossible to imagine it as a moveable.  Close to the hearth, block-shaped anvils with pentagonal footprints stand upright, and a plethora of forging tools hang from racks and ropes near the front of the space, separating the forge from several blacksmith stalls."
