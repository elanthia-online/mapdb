      "Fragments of a ship's stern litter the waves near to a harsh islet that is barely more than a cluster of dark rocks in the midst of the ocean.  The fallen shrouds hang limp on the water, tangled with other lines and jagged-edged remnants of dislodged planking.  The scent of saltwater and rotting wood fills the air, and the roar of the ocean is broken only by the tormented creaking of the remnants as they resist being claimed by the sea."
