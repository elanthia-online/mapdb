      "Softly lit by ornate gold candelabras at each corner, a flame maple dance floor has been polished to a mirror shine.  Off to one side, a small elevated platform is arranged for a musical ensemble, complete with chairs, music stands, and instruments.  A silk-draped table at the back of the tent has been laid out with refreshments."
