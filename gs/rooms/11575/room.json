      "The deck, stained unpleasantly dark, slants to starboard.  A pair of sea chests have been lashed together to form a makeshift surgical table.  The area is littered with medical supplies and instruments...bandages, pledgets made from lint and spiderwebs, tourniquets, hammers of various sizes, bone saws.  The stink of corrupt flesh pervades the room."
