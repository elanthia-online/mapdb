      "Though neatly trimmed, the hedges and trees bordering the wrought iron fencing enclosing this small area may as well be dead, their foliage a dull brown hue, each leaf seemingly barely hanging onto its native branch.  A gravel lane leads up to a well-kept white building, though a second pathway splits off from it to circle around to the back of the structure.  Settled on either side of the gravel halfway down the path, two stone benches are flanked by rose bushes bearing vibrant red roses and verdant-hued leaves."
