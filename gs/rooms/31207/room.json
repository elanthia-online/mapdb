      "The tanned hide-covered walls of the tent are covered in a myriad of lizard-themed artwork, the paintings, sketchings, and mosaics displaying reptiles in a variety of colors.  A cylindrical dark wood display is flanked by a series of twine-wrapped hooks shaped like upside down lizards, their long tails fraying from years of use.  A small cat, comically dressed in a lizard costume, glares from behind a pyrographed wooden counter, skitters around behind several boxes."
