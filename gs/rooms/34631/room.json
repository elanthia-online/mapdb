      "The road splits around a large grey marble fountain that takes the form of a parliament of owls.  The stone birds' beaks wings are widespread, and their beaks are opened wide, fountaining a spray of water that is transformed into a cascade of prismatic droplets by the sunlight.  The resplendent display of color is in stark contrast to the muted tones of the stone facades on businesses nearest the roadside."
