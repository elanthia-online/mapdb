      "Dark rosewood panels line the walls of this office furnished with a matching rosewood desk and chair.  A large stained glass window faces the esplanade, underneath which sits a low bookcase lined with many dusty tomes.  Several hooks on the wall near the door provide a handy place to hang vestments."
