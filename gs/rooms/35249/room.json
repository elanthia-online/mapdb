      "Beyond the wrought iron gate, a pebbled path of blue shale, red marl, and white travertine winds through dense laurel shrubs, cypress, tamarisk, and juniper.  Their branches arch and weave together, casting shifting patterns of shadow across the ground.  Fallen needles and leaves gather along the edges, softening the borders where stone meets earth.  The air is thick with the scent of resin and damp soil.  As the path unfurls, the undergrowth thins, revealing a small clearing at the edge of a colonnade."
