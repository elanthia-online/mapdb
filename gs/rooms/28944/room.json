      "A one-eyed wench warily glances about the shop, her hands placed firmly upon an elongated ebonwood counter situated at the center of the rug-covered floor.  The occasional spark of light flickers from a series of glass spheres flanking the counter, highlighting a pair of realistic leathery toad and frog figurines leaning against a brass-latched box.  Matching chests overflowing with a number of magical components line the brocaded walls, the contents clicking and twinkling together at various intervals."
