    "description": [
      "The high sandstone cliffs, which bar direct access to the western ocean, are just visible here amid the abundant flora.  Small shrubs and ferns tenuously hold on by shallow roots up the side of those bluffs, but elsewhere the greenery runs rampant.  Covered with decaying matter dropped by the plants that rise upward from the earth, the forest floor is dark and lacking in intense color.  Insects, however, thrive here, including many varieties of ants."
