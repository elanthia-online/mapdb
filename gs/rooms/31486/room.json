      "Dark wooden paneling lines the walls of the small hallway.  Intricately carved molding lines the ceiling, while the floor is cushioned with a thick, crimson wool carpet that travels from a narrow wooden staircase to a tall oval window.  A small bronze lantern is hung on either side of each door, the pale glow softly illuminating the narrow space."
