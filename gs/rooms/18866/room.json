      "A menacing gargoyle is the first thing you see as you enter this sparsely furnished room.  The mein creature is perched on a pedestal near the door, and you can almost feel its baleful glare like an icy touch.  Black and silver banners drape the walls in a pleasing manner, lending a breath of nobility to the room."
