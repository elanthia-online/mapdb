      "Low-eaved houses line the street and residents, predominantly halflings and humans, bustle in and out of them.  Despite the chill in the air, a small group of children plays nearby, giggles chasing them as they run down the cobblestone lane.  They seem to shy away from the entrance to a dark and narrow alley between two especially ramshackle shops.",
