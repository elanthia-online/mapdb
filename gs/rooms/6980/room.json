    "description": [
      "You stand in a small alcove in the rock behind the trickling waterfall.  Although the sheet of water is only a few feet away, this area is mostly dry, protected by the thick rocks above, yet the sound of the water fills this chamber with a hollow echo.  A narrow ledge leads out around the waterfall, and a dark passage also leads further into the rocks to the south."
