      "From niches in the walls glimmer hundreds of gigas skulls dipped in copper, silver, and other precious metals.  They are artfully adorned with chunks of ruby and seaglass here, or diamond and onyx there.  Each skull's eyes are empty ebon pits, though some are filmed over with spiderwebs or sprouting with hardy mosses."
