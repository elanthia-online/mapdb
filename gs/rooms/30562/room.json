      "Volcanic boulders pock the sandy area as if a huge hand dropped them haphazardly.  Various physical activities are conducted near each boulder with the occasional sound of weapon against weapon ringing through the area.  Tall cacti grow in small groups, and tiny lizards dart among the protective needle foliage.  Sconces affixed to each boulder light the area when night falls.  Two black obelisks stand a short distance away with a table beside each.  A wooden sign is affixed to a nearby barrel cactus."
