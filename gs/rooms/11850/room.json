      "The road to the north opens out into a wide plaza that encircles a huge tower of cut granite blocks.  Down a few steps to the south can be seen the collapsing remains of a residential section of the city.  The cracked pieces of what may have once been a green marble pedestal lie in a jumbled heap at the southwestern corner of the plaza."
