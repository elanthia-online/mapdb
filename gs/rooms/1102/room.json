    "description": [
      "The way continues along the edge of the plateau.  The trail is not marked, and, in fact, there is no trail at all.  The solid rock displays no footprints, and no one has taken the time to leave anything that indicates what direction one should go.  The Dead Plateau's interior is so uninviting, though, that at the moment the only real route follows the plateau's edge.  The wind continues unabated, bringing an equal discomfort from both its coldness and dryness."
