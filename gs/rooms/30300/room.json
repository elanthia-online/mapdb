      "Swaths of richly dyed sapphire mohair wool hang overhead, supported by burnished copper and acacia poles along the pavilion's perimeter, and pool along the edges of a rug-covered floor.  Hanging from the ceiling supports are a pair of bright lanterns that, when combined with the daylight spilling in from the tent flap, provide modest illumination of the airy space.  In the center of the room is a copper-banded acacia table flanked by an ironwood mannequin and an ebonwood mannequin, while off to the side is a woven reed screen."
