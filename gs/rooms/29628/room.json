      "The cavern is spacious, smelling of damp earth and saltwater.  Devoid of natural sunlight, a variety of bioluminescent mosses and lichens flourish underground, carpeting the sides and ground of the cave.  High above, a frothy blue-grey waterfall explodes from an opening, dumping into a deep pool teeming with life.  A crescent of agate and stone borders the rippling body of water.  At the center of the crescent is a stone pedestal and a chain-draped book with the remnants of a fused skeleton beneath."
