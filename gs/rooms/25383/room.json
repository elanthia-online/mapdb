      "Three small, pastel pink beds are lined up neatly against the far wall.  Lacy white curtains, slightly yellowed with age, flutter occasionally with errant breezes wafting through an open window.  A fuzzy stuffed pony protrudes from an open toy chest, set upon one corner of a floral patterned carpet."
