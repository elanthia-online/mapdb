      "The same shade of rich, royal purple dominates nearly every surface of this chamber, from the plush woven rug underfoot to the rune-stitched pennants dangling overhead.  Bookcases and cabinets line the chamber's walls, their shelves padded with matching purple felt and piled high with sheaves of papers for sale.  A purple-carpeted spiral staircase leads up and out of sight."
