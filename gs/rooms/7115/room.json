      "The passage dead ends just east of here, at a rough stone wall with a putrid corpse collapsed in front of it.  The odor permeates the entire area; apparently the body has been here for a couple of weeks.  It's definitely humanoid, and it's short and stocky enough to have been a dwarf, but you really can't tell for sure.  Beetles and worms and larger scavengers have been at work, and the results are grisly."
