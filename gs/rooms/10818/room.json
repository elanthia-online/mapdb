      "Patches of black, slimy water spread across the road in many places, causing slight detours, if possible on the muddy terrain.  Mostly, though, one is forced to splash through them, leaving a grimy dark residue on feet, footwear, or, in the case of rather deep puddles, both.  Often hordes of insects or small amphibians scatter out of the puddles at the footsteps' approach, disturbing and roiling the puddles as they skitter away into the safety of the flanking bulrushes."
