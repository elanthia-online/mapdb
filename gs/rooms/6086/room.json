      "A stone wall varying between three and four feet high trudges west and east, separating the farmlands and fields from the grasslands to the north.  Large granite rocks, sometimes carefully piled, sometimes haphazardly piled, form the wall.  The wall appears to be built from rocks cleared from the fields, probably to serve the purpose of keeping large foraging animals out of the wheat."
