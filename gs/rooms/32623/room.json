      "Bursts of cool air surge into the room from all four directions.  The gelatinous trail on the ceiling splits to move around a wide circular grating, and the passage of air gives the impression that it is sucked up through the grating to a place unknown.  Each puff of wind causes whatever is behind the grating to moan and whistle.  Aside from the grating and the gelatinous trail, the room is totally empty."
