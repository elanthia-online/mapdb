      "Carved from pale marble that blushes faintly blue in the light of ensconced torches, the walls and arching roof of the shrine are carved with a multitude of winter roses.  The etched flowers are subtly tinted with various shades of red.  Beneath a teardrop-shaped arch of fine filigreed silver, a pale maiden statue stands with her hands raised, looking down at the kneeling forms of several statuary halflings."
