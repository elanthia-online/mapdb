    "description": [
      "Lopsidedly draped against the obsidian rock forming Charl's Teeth, the westward edge of the coral reef clings as if seeking protection from the wildness of the ocean beyond that imposing natural portal.  The orange-pink hue of the porous coral stands in sharp contrast to the glossy black of the obsidian cliff.  Bright against dark, rough against smooth, dead against living:  the slick crag and bumpy reef serve as testament to the intense environmental variation within this narrow watercourse."
