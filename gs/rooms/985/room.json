      "Pens filled with bleating roltons occupy the east side of the roadway.  Rolton carcasses, stripped of their fur, heads and extremities, hang on racks outside the slaughterhouse.  There is no worry of spoilage as the frigid air keeps the carcasses in a frozen state.  Unused rolton parts are piled unceremoniously behind the slaughterhouse, and, despite the frozen condition of the parts, rats scurry through the pile, dragging claimed pieces away to devour elsewhere."
