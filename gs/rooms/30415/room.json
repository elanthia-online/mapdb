    "description": [
      "Beneath lapping blue waters powered by the strong easterly current, a rising mountain of sea glass glistens secretively.  Whatever force brought so much of the substance into this particular spot on the ocean floor, some combination of natural factors in this location set the glass in a pattern of substantive collection over uncounted centuries.  The jewel-tone glass presses against the black of Charl's Teeth, almost like gems laid upon a background of black silk."
