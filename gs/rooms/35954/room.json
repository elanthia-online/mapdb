      "Bathed in warm candlelight from a dark vaalin chandelier, shadows cling to the richly paneled satinwood walls and heavy brocade curtains pulled back to reveal expansive glaes-paned windows.  The parlor's centerpiece, a low-backed settee upholstered in deep crimson damask, faces a glassy obsidian fireplace over which hangs an oval gilt-framed mirror.  A grand mahogany side table sits under a cluster of ancestral portraits, the paint on their austere faces cracked and flaking."
