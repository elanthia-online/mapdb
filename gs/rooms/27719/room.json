      "The wall to the south is dominated by the barbican over the East Gate of the city.  A tall barbican tower stands just south of this position, and a single window high above provides the only point of access from the wall.  The curious odor of medicinal tart-baking wafts from Ma Leaftoe's shop on the other side of Fear Alley."
