      "A squat house with arced shingles sits on this side of town center, its visage dowdy, though in good repair.  Stones trail one after another from the bottom of the house steps, moving toward the openness of the square as a neat pathway bordered by small, purple flowers.  Off to the side of the house is a short, ironwork fence, and inside the fence is an equally drab-looking, old, grey goat."
