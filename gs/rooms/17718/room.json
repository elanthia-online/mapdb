      "Old musty hay is spread across much of the floor of the dungeon cell, obscuring lengths of chains and manacles attached to the wall.  A tin bowl lies overturned in the middle of the floor, its contents long lost to the passage of time.  Nearby the bowl, a wood stool lies with its three feet pointing up at the ceiling of the cell."
