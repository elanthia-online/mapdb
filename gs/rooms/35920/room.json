      "To the northwest, the trees recede to the edge of an open grove that lies beyond a woven willow branch archway.  Gauzy bronze-hued fabric is arranged along the crest of the arch and drapes each side before continuing in a shallow swag along the adjoining fence.  Miniature paper lanterns dangle like luminescent fruit from the tree limbs overhead, dispelling any darkness from the path."
