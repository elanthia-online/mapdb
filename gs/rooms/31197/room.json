      "Rich plum-hued wool hangs from a dark walnut framework that creates the peaked roof and walls of this large tent.  Boxes and bins are piled up against the walls, their lids open with contents spilling out.  A thick carpet of animal skins covers the ground.  Hanging above the center is a trio of dark bronze lanterns, their frosted crystal panes illuminating the shop with a muted, pale light."
