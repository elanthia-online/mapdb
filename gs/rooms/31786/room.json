      "The walkway fades into hard-packed sand as you step into the area, the coastline engulfed by larger-than-life toy frigates forming a monstrous wall looming across the horizon.  Churning greyish black waters lap against the dilapidated pier, continously slapping faded flags against the wooden logs.  Blue-furred stuffed animals dart in and out of half-toppled huts of palm fronds, their veiny hands repeatedly gripping each doorway with a faint snarl."
