      "[Long Corridor]"
    ],
    "description": [
      "A long, narrow corridor extends east and west.  It is an unpretentious corridor, with no carpeting or wall coverings to alleviate the boredom of a granite floor, shored granite walls and a shored granite ceiling.  A giant toadstool occupies a brass pot, though the light cast by the toadstool is hardly ample to illuminate the entire corridor.  A heavy iron gate occupies a spot in the north wall, and a dim opening yawns in the corridor's east end."
