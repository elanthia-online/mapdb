      "Bone-white birch trees stand guard around a small clearing in the woods, their scale-like shards of bark warping with age to reveal the darker wood beneath.  A thin breeze rustles their dry leaves, sending a whisper through the quiet woods.  A decrepit shack, battered by weather and the weight of time, leans against a particularly stout trunk, as if begging the tree itself for support.  The roof of the shack, apparently formed from sewn sheets of tanned animal hide, lies in tatters.",
