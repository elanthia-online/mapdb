      "Several wooden shelves line each wall of this confined room, allowing for plenty of storage space.  Polished gold lanterns are bolted firmly to the walls, offering more than enough light to inspect the supplies that have been laid out.  Dominating the southern wall, behind a rough wooden counter, are two large iron bins, one painted red and the other gold."
