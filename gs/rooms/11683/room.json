      "Thick, impenetrable fog looms over a pathway leading to the west.  In the oppsite direction, the surrounding mist appears to be less dense and is filled with the silhouettes of thousands of tall reeds.  Birds call back and forth to each other from above and to either side, their songs muted by the damp whiteness that plagues the fens.  The sun's light, reduced to a weak presence, filters through a low ceiling of grey.",
