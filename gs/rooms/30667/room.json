      "Short flagstone steps curve east to north from the hall's entrance and widen significantly as they drop to the floor of an expansive refectory.  Four statues, depicting a sand devil, a siren lizard, a thrak, and a pyrothag, rest upon heavy bronze pedestals set back into the smooth, grey stone walls on either side.  Yellow-green light filters from above and below, dimly lighting the stairway as it reflects off the walls."
