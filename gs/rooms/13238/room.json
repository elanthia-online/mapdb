      "This sprawling shop is piled to the rafters with useful items.  Dust-covered bolts of sailcloth line one wall, and backpacks hang in rows from ceiling hooks, dangling just overhead.  A dusty counter runs the length of the room, piled high with various dry goods.  A heavyset half-Elven woman lounges behind the counter."
