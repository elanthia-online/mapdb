      "Halfway up the north face of the ridge, the sheer size of the battlements to the south is evident.  Either they were built by Giantmen, or by hundreds of dwarves with more time and energy than they knew what to do with.  A ramp, displaying the crisp colors of freshly worked stone, begins here and rises to intersect the wall where the crenellations have been removed."
