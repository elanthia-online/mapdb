      "Snowmelt and the passage of years have conspired to make the ceiling a mass of dangling stalactites that drip icy wetness onto the path.  The rock formations bear down over the walkway like the fangs of a hungering beast in places, only adding to the claustrophobic press of the walls to either side.  A constant low moan fills the air, emanating from the south."
