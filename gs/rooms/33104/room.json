      "Dank and humid, the brigantine's interior is dimly lit by flickering torches.  A ripped banner hangs along the back wall, reading \"Bank of Kraken's Fall,\" and an incongruously pristine and gigantic iron vault sits in the corner behind a rickety counter.  Two guards flank the vault, each bristling with weaponry and bulging muscles."
