      "Streams of moonlight break through a canopy of moss overhead draping from the top of a red mulberry tree.  Scattered leaves in autumnal hues cover the ground, with giant white puffballs peeking through.  Surrounding the tree in concentric circles are several stumps of once great evergreens, the remnants cut down to provide ample seating.  A moss-draped door offers entrance to a medium-sized home at the edge of the clearing.",
