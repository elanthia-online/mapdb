      "Nestled beneath travertine terraces, a small avenue features the beginnings of a grand staircase that rises towards the cliffs above.  Carved into the stone, the steps resemble the scales of a dragon's back, and a pair of stone statues guards the ascent.  Surrounding the staircase are several vine-covered buildings, their walls adorned with blooming vines and their roofs covered in terracotta.  Clusters of cistus shrubs stretch between a white wooden gate and the open doors of a sturdy stable, their delicate blooms perfuming the air."
