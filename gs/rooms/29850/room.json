      "The grey and blue canvas of the tent walls reeks of salt, fish, and blood.  A half-krolvin with one arm sits comfortably on a stool in the corner, picking his teeth with a thin bone shard as his eyes guard the contents along a driftwood counter and a rusty anchor-shaped rack.  Old flakes of blood stain the floor like shriveled, crimson petals."
