      "Polished teak floors gleam beneath a delicate patina of lacquer and reflect the golden sunlight that filters in through the room's linen-framed windows.  Positioned beneath an elaborate chandelier, a violet rug supports a claw-foot low mahogany table surrounded by armchairs and loveseats.  Occupying the eastern wall, a marble-mantled fireplace is surrounded by a whitewashed haon door on one side and a linden-edged white door on the other.",
