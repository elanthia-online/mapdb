      "Ground squirrels bustle about between the exposed boulders, searching for pine nuts and other delicacies to take to their burrows.  Occasionally they bump into each other and playfully jump and swat at one another in mock battle.  The approach of a stranger, though, sends one or two into chittering fits, alerting the others to the presence of a possible danger.  All of them suddenly seem to vanish from sight, and the area becomes strangely quiet.",
