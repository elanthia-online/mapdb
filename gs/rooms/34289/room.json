      "With the mountain face to the east and the open range to the west, the winds of the region are unforgiving, and there is little to no shelter.  Mist from a nearby waterfall keeps the rock wall in a perpetual clammy state, and an odd layer of mold has grown along many fallen branches and rotting logs.  Secured to the mountain side are two iron tracks, and a large wooden cage is attached to a series of metal poles and steel wires."
