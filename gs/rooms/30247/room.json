      "Five piers of saltstained oak edged with darkened glaes form a large docking structure with ample portage.  Covered with myriad, tiny barnacles in a variety of colors, teak support posts frame each docking slip.  Thick cork bumpers are each painted with a chubby white goose, and a glaes-inlaid sign reads, \"West Docks, Dragonfire Pier - Slips 6-10.\""
