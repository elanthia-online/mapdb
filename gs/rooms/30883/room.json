      "A long table surrounded by well-worn chairs provides comfortable seating for thespians hearing last minute instructions or just waiting to go onstage.  The west wall supports overflow storage of miscellaneous flats and large props clustered in untidy and dusty groups.  The air is scented with a delicious mix of dust, paint, stage makeup, and that indefinable scent of drama just waiting to unfold."
