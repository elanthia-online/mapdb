      "Clogged with the rotted remains of books, parchments, and scrolls, the solid monir bookcases that enclose the once great library are stained with mold and swollen with fetid water.  Broken tables and chairs lie in shambles about the space and are draped in blankets fashioned of cobwebs and dust.  Resting in the clear space at the center of the room is a polished silver tray laden with the remains of some long ago offering."
