      "Looming stones stand in a rough semicircle, their shadows long and dark in the enduring twilight.  At their center is an altar of ruddy stone primitively carved with scenes of battle and bloodshed.  An ugly, blade-shaped symbol of blackened metal is set into the flat of the altar.  Intense warmth washing off of encircling granite braziers wars with the chill of the unrelenting wind, which buffets the implacable standing stones in shrieking attacks."
