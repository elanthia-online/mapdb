      "Spiraling up teak columns, vibrant, multihued organza opens into layers of draping, diaphanous curtains.  Elaborate sprays of vivid tropical flowers and verdant ferns blossom in the porcelain vases, swept with gold leaf, set on either side of a lacquered teak rack.  Punched with a floral pattern, a trio of hanging coconut shell lanterns cast light upon a vellum-paneled divider painted with blue macaws and a gilt-hooked rosewood display."
