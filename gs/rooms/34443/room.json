      "Blocking a view of the city, oleander shrubs grow along a short stone wall that separates a plot of manicured grass from that of the neighboring home.  Enameled chairs of bright white encircle an enameled wrought iron table upon the grey slate slabs of the patio, which rests beneath a canopy of emerald green canvas.  Surrounded by potted raised herb gardens, a bright white door leads into the residence."
