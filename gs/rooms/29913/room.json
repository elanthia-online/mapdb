      "The stench of fermenting solution is almost overpowering within the hut despite the wide windows and open door.  Large stone vats of the stuff sit along the far wall, which is decorated with finished hides and a few crudely mounted animal heads.  The wooden planks of the floor are deeply stained.  A half-skinned white bear sits atop a stone table opposite the vats."
