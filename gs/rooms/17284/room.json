      "Daylight spills through tall arched windows, infusing this office with radiant warmth.  Though spartanly furnished, it provides a welcome retreat for all who enter.  Rows of oak shelves, arrayed with tomes, trophies, and mementos, bracket an enormous stone fireplace above which hangs a striking oil portrait.  In the center of the room, offering a convenient gathering place for discussion and banter, sits a long scarred oaken table surrounded by high-backed chairs.  A large oak desk rests opposite the fireplace."
