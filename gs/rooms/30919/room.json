      "A stained cherrywood door opens out onto a spacious terrace shielded from the open air by an enclosure of beveled crystal, the edges of which are brought alive with golden flame by the sun's radiance.  Just past a faenor-traced ebonwood table with some leather-covered ebonwood chairs clustered around it, a small aperture in the glass forms a halo about a walk of stone that juts into the open air to the northwest."
