      "A gold flyrsilk map hangs above a gold mahogany bed with a flyrsilk-draped canopy situated near a window that runs the breadth of the stern, the view of the sea beyond superior to any painting hanging on the mahogany-paneled walls of this well appointed cabin.  The nautical charts strewn across a gold mahogany table tell the ship's history at sea, while the details are all recorded in the log books stacked on a mahogany throne cushioned with plush velvet.  A large sea chest occupies one corner, a lock securing its contents inside."
