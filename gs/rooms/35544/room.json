      "Worn stone walls enclose the cavern where a twisted driftwood table rests near a broad coral pool that fills most of the space.  Along the ledge, a narrow fissure cuts through rock, vanishing into shadow.  Light from a small torch flickers over the surface of the water in shifting lines as slow currents drift past.  Arcing formations create an irregular ceiling above, enclosing the space in layered curves."
