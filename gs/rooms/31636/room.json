    "description": [
      "Flanked by railings, the cobbled road arcs across a vast orchard that sprawls along the northern edge of town, while on the south of the bridge a more manicured and refined orchard fills the village's interior, surrounded by high walls.  Benches butt against the edge, providing resting space to enjoy the scenery of the area beneath.  A lantern-flanked arbor to the north has winding stairs beyond its verdant arc, offering entry to the grounds below."
