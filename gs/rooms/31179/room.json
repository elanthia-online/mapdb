      "Bobbing gently in the pond, the floating mat of moss is spongy and sways with the littlest of movement.  It is anchored to the northern edge of the shore by bulrush and sedge, which prevents it from floating free.  Flanking it, a pair of stepping stones provides access to the eastern shores of the pond, while a partially rotted wooden plank leads to the west."
