      "Warm and dry, the round cave has a narrow corridor leading to the southwest, where the gentle sound of lapping waves can be heard.  Bright and cheery, a large bonfire in the center of the chamber keeps the dampness of the salty sea air at bay.  Several crates, trunks, and casks are lined against one wall, their lids tightly sealed to ensure the safety and preservation of their contents."
