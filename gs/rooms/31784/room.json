      "The cavernous hollows of moss-covered stone enclose the area from the rest of the neighborhood, casting shadows that pierce through the mists hovering above the ground.  Bearded toy marionettes lay scattered and broken against the rocks, covered in grey-colored boils, their mouths stained with flakes of rust.  A tall glass-eyed doll sits in an alcove high above, its curved fangs peeking out from a painted mouth of red."
