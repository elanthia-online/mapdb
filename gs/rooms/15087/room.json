      "Blue watered silk walls rise from a polished oak floor.  Just above an elegantly dressed maiden statue hangs an oil-filled silver sconce, and a mistwood beam ceiling completes the picture.  A heavy white granite counter and a gilded maple cabinet stand side by side in the middle of the room."
