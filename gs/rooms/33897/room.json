      "Bronze-latticed curtains of heady florals frame the ceiling-high windows, the arcs of flora draping over the glass and casting shadowed silhouettes across the ebony-planked floor.  The shelf-covered limestone wall displays a kaleidoscope of glass bottles, the arrangements decorated with hand-drawn sketchings of vineyards, each parchment labeled in gilded ink.  A three-sided counter of sanded ebony crates encompasses the back of the shop, encircled by a variety of high-backed leather chairs."
