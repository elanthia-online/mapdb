      "Unrelenting weather has a cruel effect on this area, leaving the muddy ground slick in areas where the rocks have shifted, and the rocky ground dangerous where moss and mildew have taken residence.  A precipitous rockface leading to a western plateau appears formidable, while the southern trail, lined with broken shells and cracked eggs, appears much more stable."
