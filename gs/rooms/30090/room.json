      "Elegantly organized, this spacious room is spotless, from textured invar flooring to sturdy modwir joists and ceiling.  A set of modwir racks stands in a dignified manner between some brass shelving and a hammered copper counter.  A heavy brushed invar door presents an air of both invitation and security, appearing to serve as a reliable barrier from unwanted incursion from either side."
