      "Frosted globes dangling from vaalin chains set into the ceiling sway slightly in the cool river breeze that passes through the small shop from the long open windows set into each of the room's three walls.  Decorative and functional wicker chairs offer perches for waiting customers and are arranged in casual patterns amongst the trunks and counters displaying the shop's wares."
