      "Honeycomb-shaped cubbies ring the space, their compartments fitted with tomes and neatly rolled scrolls, while lanterns placed along the upper ledges cast a steady light.  Shielded vessels filled with ruby red coals maintain a dry, even warmth, their glow steady beneath protective grates and lids.  A thick fleece rug spans the floor, its dense fibers muting footsteps and softening the acoustics within the sacred chamber."
