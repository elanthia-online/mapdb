      "Rows of rust-hued brick line the walls of the repurposed entryway.  The spacious room is illuminated by several brass lanterns.  Set into the floor is a beautiful mosaic of colorful shells.  A silver filigree plaque hangs between a pair of small, dusty windows.  Placed just inside the room next to a curtained stone archway is a large notice board."
