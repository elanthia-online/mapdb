      "Heavy curtains of cobwebs drape across the circular copper shield that is fitted into the worn stones of the wall, the tattered skeins dangling to dust-littered floor.  Empty sconces, blackened with the remains of burn-out torches, flank a glass and brass display case along another wall, while the remaining two display faded squares where portraits may once have been displayed."
