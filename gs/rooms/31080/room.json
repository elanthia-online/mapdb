      "Flanked by windows in the eastern and western walls, the remaining wall is dominated by low cabinets, high shelves, and a sturdy rhimar-lined cupboard.  Piping in one corner allows smoke from a pot-bellied stove to exit the bungalow, while an oversized soapstone basin beside it is fed by exterior pipes that conveniently draw water into its deep recesses.  A butcher block table surrounded by tall stools sits in the center of the room."
