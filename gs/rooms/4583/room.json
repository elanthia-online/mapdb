      "Standing in the center of the walled courtyard is a masterfully crafted water fountain created in the image of a sea kraken.  Wrapped in the kraken's tentacles is a flawless crown-of-Charl shell, from which the water cascades into the base of the fountain.  Well-kept flowerbeds containing an assortment of exotic flowers have been bordered with a collection of ruby-lined nassa shells, along with yellow, pink, and blue coquina shells.  An opal-flecked walkway leads up to a set of double doors."
