      "Torn open to spill its downy guts on the hardwood floor, a small bed dominates the ransacked bedroom.  Goose feathers twitch warily on the wind whistling through a broken bay window on the northern wall, through which trickles icy starlight.  A crooked armoire stands open, one of its doors hanging on twisted hinges, revealing moldering clothing too long exposed to the elements to be salvageable."
