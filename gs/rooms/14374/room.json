      "Dulcet-hued honey oak frames the tidy, riverstone-tiled antechamber, lent depth by the roseate luminescence filtering in through the panes of some stained glass windows framing the front door's silver-inlaid bulk.  The ceiling rises into a gentle dome, the base of which is encircled by a pattern of downy, snow-colored feathers against a verdant backdrop."
