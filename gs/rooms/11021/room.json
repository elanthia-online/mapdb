      "Thick, leafy vines hang between the tall trees.  Smaller vines grow on the larger vines, and strange mosses grow on the smaller ones, giving the entire area a shaggy look.  Only a few pale beams of moonlight filter through the dense growth.  A tall, moss-covered stone pillar stands to one side of the obscure trail.  Bits of stone lie scattered throughout the area.",
