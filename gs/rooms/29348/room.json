      "A rainbow canopy covers this open-air booth with great swathes of fabric dripping in a carnival-like display at each of the four corners.  There is a glass case filled with candy which serves as the focal point of the small structure.  A slight breeze keeps the air inside the booth moving, subtly tickling the senses with the fulsome scent of dark chocolate.  The floor underneath has been polished to an intensely bright white, and tasteful lamps supplement the natural lighting without overwhelming it."
