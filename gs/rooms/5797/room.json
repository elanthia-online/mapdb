      "The ceiling rises to an expansive height, giving the chamber an airy feel which belies the unfathomable weight of the DragonSpine Mountains above.  A pair of torches flank the passage to the west, and streaks of minerals along the walls reveal their true hues under the torchlight.  Lichen blurs the rough edges of the scarred rock walls."
