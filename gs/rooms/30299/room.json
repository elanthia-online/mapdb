      "Soft and less traveled here, the desert trail splits around a disfigured palm tree that marks a definitive end to the market.  Heatwaves shimmer above the sand beyond, obscuring the contours of faraway yurts and tents rounding the western side of the brilliant oasis.  Armor-plated yierka, deceptively small at this distance, gather at the water's edge.  Hitched between two date palms, a linen rope hammock faces the lush, verdant paradise."
