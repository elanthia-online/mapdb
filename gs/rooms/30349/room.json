      "Portholes mark both ends of the long corridor, the verdigris copper standing out on the mahogany walls.  Shield lanterns sway as the boat gently rocks at harbor, casting shadows upon the sparse white oak planks that fashion the floor.  Sturdy doors to the east and west have angles cut into their tops as the boat narrows this close to the bow."
