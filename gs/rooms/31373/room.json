      "Starlight drifts through large paned windows on either side of the entryway, illuminating the circular salon in a silvered glow.  Hooded copper lanterns are suspended along the marble pilasters flanking several bookcases, each stacked floor to ceiling with a variety of tomes and manuscripts.  Several armchairs are arranged around a low table at the center, and a desk stands beneath one of the windows.  A shallow copper brazier emitting wafts of incense rests near the entry."
