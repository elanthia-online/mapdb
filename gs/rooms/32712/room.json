    "description": [
      "Embraced by a viridian wall patterned with a whirlwind of snowy feathers, the chamber houses a circular depression ringed by a rise of concentric steps.  Only an illuminated panel breaks the white storm.  Standing at the heart of the sanctuary is a slender winged statue lathed by silver moonlight pouring through a skylight high above.  A low curved stone stands before the statue, spotted with candle wax and the ashy leavings of old incense."
