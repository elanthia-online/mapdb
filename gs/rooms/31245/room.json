      "Various bits and bobs from glassworking are scattered across the floor, and tools of the trade clutter one corner.  Dozens of plump, soft velvet cushions provide comfortable places to rest.  A silvery violet silk curtain leads back to the main pavilion, and dozens of arathiel fireflies in a variety of colors dangle from the ceiling, reflecting ambient light in a polychromatic glow."
