    "description": [
      "Stretching northward, a long column of white picket fences departs from the central viewing area of the pens towards the entrance gates where clumps of snow still cling to the blue-green grass.  Colorful awnings of bright yellow, red, and green provide shelter from the elements, though they still sway when the arctic breezes pass through.  Along the southern section are three pens filled with roltons, sheep, and goats."
