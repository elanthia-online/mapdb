    "description": [
      "At a fork in the path, a tranquil pond lies nestled amid thick foliage, its surface reflecting the tangled greenery above.  Lily pads float serenely, their delicate white and pink blossoms in silent competition with the more strident maroons and yellows of nearby lotuses.  Dragonflies with crimson and cerulean bodies skim gracefully across the cold, clear water, iridescent wings flashing.  The dense jungle presses in close as if anxious to keep the pond sacrosanct and secret."
