      "Amidst the spikes of granite that pierce the ground, there are massive shards of obsidian, and here and there, impaled skeletons cling only by the arrangement of their bones to the tips of the protrusions.  Ripples of heat roil into the air from the ground, and every trembling through the dirt threatens an eruption of flame."
