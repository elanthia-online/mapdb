      "Atop a set of vast stone steps, the walkway curves toward the northwest, the path guided by long-spent torches in brackets of rusted iron.  One has been wrenched free from its setting, with a gaping hole in the stone left behind.  Cold gusts of air whistle along the sepulchral halls like a chorus of mourning cries."
