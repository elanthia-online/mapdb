      "Golden linden frames surround floor-to-ceiling windows upon the southern and western walls, the glass within whorled and opaque, causing only a dim impression of the natural light to filter through.  Curios and cupboards are scattered about the parlor, their lacquered faces glinting in the light of the room's sconces, while an elaborately carved cabinet is deliberately placed beneath a spotlight.  Offering egress, a lacquered ebonwood archway opens up the eastern wall."
