      "A woven runner bisects this area of the tent, with a set of sturdy wooden pegs mounted over to one side, while a many-armed rack of wooden head displays is arranged on the other.  The scent of spiced smoke is heavier here, with incense burning in one corner in addition to the lamps hanging overhead."
