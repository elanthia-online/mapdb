      "Rough-cut stakes as long as a human is tall are buried, blunt end, in the stone floor, stationed at an angle that directs attention northward.  Their sharpened tips are dark with aged blood and caked with dried flesh, and when attention manages to stray beyond their compelling points, deeply scored sigils can be found on the walls on either side of the passage.  It is obvious their origins are demonic in nature."
