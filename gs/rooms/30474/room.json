      "Shadows encase the base of the temple-topped cliff to the northeast, darkening the waters of a flourishing tidepool bound by coral reef.  A variety of sea creatures rest in the cliff's lee, taking refuge in the darkened water as night settles in.  Soft breezes carrying the scent of water lilies and wisteria float down from the temple's height."
