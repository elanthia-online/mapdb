      "Tiny black arachnids writhe over the cragged surface of the cave walls, and in the light from the web-rimmed entrance, their bodies seem a shifting sea of quickened onyx.  The surreptitious sussurus of countless scurrying steps echoes down a northeastern tunnel, where green-tinged pale phosphorescence relieves the shadows.  A pungent scent like crude oil saturates the air."
