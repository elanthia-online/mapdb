      "Standing upon a massive mound is a large manor, raised as if to challenge the looming presence of Tower Hill itself.  The manor appears to be long abandoned, and has been lessened in grandeur by time and the elements.  A half-open, rusty iron gate allows access to the grounds, though the path is now teeming with uncontrolled plant life."
