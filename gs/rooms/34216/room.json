      "Fungus drapes the mouth of a tunnel that branches off from the north, its wan phosphorescence a pale candle against the brighter, prismatic glow throbbing from within.  Several huge chunks of crystal are heaped next to the opening, their hues ranging from striking purple to pale white.  The latter match the color, if not the size, of the immense spar of crystal sprouting from the base of the grotto below."
