      "The modestly sized side room is accented by a trio of stained glass lancet windows that drench the pale mistwood floors in jewel-like colors.  Filigreed bronze sconces gently light a mosaic-inset ebony vanity that is partially concealed by a latticework black ash divider.  A carmine brocaded silk chaise sits on the adjacent wall next to a ruby-shelved tea cart, above which hangs a scrollworked crystalline mirror."
