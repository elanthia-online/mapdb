      "Dark-boled trees stand, tall and tenebrous, to either side of the wide boulevard.  Their leaves are pale, of a green that seems silvered by moonlight.  Blossoms of an unearthly hue, like snow tinged lavender, cling to the branches like wispy fleece.  Eyes like little black beads glint from the darkness of the lower boughs, and their owners' ebon feathers litter the pavement.  Tall homes with hard angles and steepled rooftops loom beyond the trees."
