      "A violent wind whips around the air outside a large ring of towering obsidian spires, driving the rain sideways and fracturing the surface of the lake into choppy crests, but within their protective circle, the air is still, the rain does not fall, and the wind does not howl.  Fractal veins of white zorchar are exposed in the glossy black surface of the columns, like lightning trapped in stone, and glow with a pale blue luminescence."
