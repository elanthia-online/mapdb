      "Dark heartwood, polished almost as smooth as glass, is carved with twisting fishscale motifs that spiral outward in an intricate pattern.  Hunter green bunting droops down from above, backlit by brass lanterns suspended from the overhead.  Sturdy benches cobbled together from driftwood and copper nails sit to either side.  At the center of the table, an ivory sea serpent stands, baleful eyes looking toward the entrance of the mess."
