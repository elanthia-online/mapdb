      "On the southern face of the mountain, a break in the jagged cliffs reveals a steep sluice that in more reasonable climbs would be a challenging ski slope.  Heavy blankets of snow line either side of the slope, jammed in between two imposing ridges caked with black ice.  Only the most foolhardy would attempt to scale the high bluffs."
