      "The wide-planked deck slants to starboard.  Wooden crates and barrels are stacked from deck to ceiling.  Most are lashed against each other and to the bulkhead, but a few have broken loose.  The starboard bulkhead is buckled inward, creating a small hole high on the bulkhead wall just below the ceiling.  Moonlight pours through the hole, and the sound of waves can be heard.",
