      "Stretching to the horizon, cresting dunes dip and rise in rolling mounds of deep tawny sand.  Date palms grow in tight clumps to the south, sunlit azure water glinting between their scaled trunks.  Nailed to a sweet acacia tree, blossomed with sunny yellow puffs, a sun-bleached thick papyrus sign greets passersby on the newly trod path."
