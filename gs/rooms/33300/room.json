      "Illuminated by frosted globes that rest upon wrought iron sconces, the armory has heavy tapestries on its walls and thick carpets that muffles all sound in the space.  Suits of armor, some incredibly archaic and stained with age or use, stand like silent sentinels around the small armory.  A smattering of short-backed crescent chairs resides in the four corners, while a large planning table occupies the center."
