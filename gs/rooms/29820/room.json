      "Cramped and musty, there isn't a whole lot of extra room within this small shed.  Burning candles, their flames a dull purple, are scattered around a low ivory shrine, which is pushed up against the back wall.  Sitting in one corner is a branching stand constructed from bleached bone, its tiered arms pressed flush to the stone behind it.  Tiny bones and feathers litter the dirt floor, making the footing precarious.",
