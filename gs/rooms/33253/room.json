      "The inside of the cell is rank...so rank it seems even the rats have found better accomodations.  Water drips from the ceiling, nurturing a foul-smelling mold on the walls and making the packed earth floor a sloppy mud.  On closer inspection, a pile of red dust becomes the remnants of shackles long ago rusted, and you hesitate to inspect the puddle in the corner.  You will certainly keep from breaking the law in this place, if only to never have to see this cell again."
