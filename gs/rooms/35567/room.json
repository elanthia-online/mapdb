      "Jagged coral walls enclose a chamber, their serpentine protuberances calcified in undulation.  Silver-bellied eels wend through their branching hollows, narrow heads peeking out before vanishing again with lightning fast flicks of their tails.  Glass orbs suspended from the ceiling cage crackling sparks, casting flickering blue-white light in chaotic arcs across the sand.  An oak barrel, its staves swollen and warped by long submersion, rests near the entrance, weapons jutting from its brine-darkened mouth."
