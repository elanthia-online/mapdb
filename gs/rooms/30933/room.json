      "The overlook is a dizzy perch positioned on a narrow outcrop of buttress roots, which plunge down from the precarious ledge in a steep descent to the jungle floor below.  A railing of interwoven vines encloses the aerie, however the barrier doesn't appear to be sturdy enough to sustain much more weight than the baskets of flowers hanging from it.  In the distance, Greymist can be seen, with clouds of mist shifting across its expanse like ghost ships on an emerald sea."
