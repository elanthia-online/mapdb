      "Crimson walls surround this small alcove off the central nexus to the west.  The focal point of the space is a swirling red and gold portal framed by an oval of wrought silver.  Intricate wyverns have been etched into the metal, their sinuous lengths intertwined, creating a complex scrollwork pattern.  A mild breeze swirls around the area, scented of the flora of Ta'Vaalor."
