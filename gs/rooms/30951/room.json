      "Curving about the garden, the pond arcs out, creating a secluded swimming hole.  Several varieties of water grass grow along the banks, cattails swaying with the slight current.  Pale sand and small river stones pad the bottom with tiny fish darting back and forth under the surf.  Several weeping willows fan out, their draping branches sway with the slightest breeze and allow moonlight through basking the area in a pale glow."
