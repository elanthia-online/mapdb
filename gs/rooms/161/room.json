      "A tall privet hedge runs along both sides of the cobblestone wey.  Crushed riverstone footpaths leads through entryway gaps in the hedge, providing some view of the stately mansions that lie behind.  Three-story town homes, constructed of enormous greystone blocks flashed with mica-flecked granite, stand in a stately row amidst carefully tended formal gardens.",
      "Multistory villas, constructed of enormous silvery blue blocks flashed with mica, stand in a stately row amidst carefully tended formal gardens.  Each is domed and tiled atop.  One of the homes sits back behind a high silver fence and gate.  The wey is amply lit with a series of argent and glass lanterns.",
