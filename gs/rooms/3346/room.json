      "Low-slung buildings crowd the street, jockeying with each other for position.  The names of many who have travelled over this road are carved into the cobblestones paving the street, the result of a massive fund raising effort to redo the roadwork in the Burrow.  Lamps hang off the fronts of the houses, throwing wavering pools of light on the doorways."
