    "description": [
      "Thin rows of well-manicured plants spread out in even rows within a white picket fence.  Vines of shiny leafed sage and bushes of spiny-stemmed dill are only a few of the herbal varieties that fill the small garden.  A low and flat circular trough set to the side of the garden houses fresh fish that is being stored for later preparation.  Aromas from the nearby kitchen drift on the gentle air and fill the garden with the smell of roasting meats.  Nearby, a thin grass-lined footpath leads onward through the garden."
