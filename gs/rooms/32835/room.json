      "The march of columns turns northeast along a marble wall lined with lit iron sconces.  A shadowed alcove in the west wall partially conceals a modest ironwood door mounted on iron hinges.  Spying through the forest of stone, a large obelisk can be seen at the center of a golden torch-lit clearing to the southeast.  The faint scent of soot lingers in the still atmosphere."
