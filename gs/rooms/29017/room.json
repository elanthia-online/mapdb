      "Light and dark-stained bookcases line the western edge of the large shop, their various shelves housing a variety of nautical instrumentation, while the eastern wall is filled with several plush bunks that are adorned with heavy velvet drapes.  A gold and crimson knotwork carpet stretches across the floor, providing a colorful backdrop to the various chairs and tables on display.  Discretely placed to one side, a small counter has a ledger, an ink vial, and a quill resting upon its leather-bound ink blotter."
