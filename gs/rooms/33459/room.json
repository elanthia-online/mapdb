      "White paneling covers the walls of the shop with twin windows draped with pink curtains making the atmosphere bright and airy.  A frosted glass-covered counter is centered on a thick alabaster carpet woven with sparkling threads of silver.  Several displays lined with thick paper doilies are set around the room. The scent of rich chocolate fills the air."
