      "Pale beeswax candles perch atop silver stands that are scattered about the room.  Large mahogany bookshelves cover most of the walls almost fully obscuring the pale marble that encloses the space.  Woven carpeting of silk captures a mosaic of cool blues and greens while covering the floor and cushioning any sounds of movement."
