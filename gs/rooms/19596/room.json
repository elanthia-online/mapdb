      "Bedecked with water lilies and their pads, the reflection pool is small and lined in cobalt tiles that give the cool waters a deep blue hue.  Lanterns housed in the boughs of an ancient oak tree illuminate various points along the pathway and reflect on the smooth surface of the water beneath them.  A row of sirenflowers bows their head as they sway in the gentle seaside breeze, occassionally chiming as they do, in reverence to the sunlight above.",
