      "Bathed in sparkling moonlight, the cozy galley is comprised of light-hued, polished wood flooring with cheerful whitewashed walls featuring ocean blue accents.  A wave-etched white stone basin sits beneath a seaglass mosaic depicting the island, and a small kitchen table is positioned near an oversized brass and koa pantry.  A narrow-tipped balcony filled with greenery is visible through a koa-inlaid glass door."
