      "This tiny hut is stuffed floorboards to rafters with whistling, spinning, clanging contraptions.  Sweet and savory smells collide in a cascade of appealing aromas as they billow from the myriad of pressure pots and steaming cauldrons.  Bronze pipes running along the walls rattle at regular intervals as streams of steam spurt from loose fittings.  A long counter boasts several large jars of interesting looking confections."
