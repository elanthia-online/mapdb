      "Warped boards, dark with water stains and mottled with off-white acorn barnacles, form the walls of the small shop, which vaguely resembles a ship's bunk room.  Tangle clumps of seaweed, rotted and foul, dangle in long ribbons from the ceiling, while eerily glowing glass orbs rest within fishing net and provide illumination for the space.  Open chests and trunks are bolted to the uneven floor and are filled with reclaimed wares."
