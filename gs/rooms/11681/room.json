      "The fog borders on impentrable and only the closest reeds are visible.  The twisting path narrows as it winds to the northwest, disappearing into the fog.  Every footstep creates a sucking sound as the mud protests passage, while previous foot and paw prints are filled with water reflecting the available light.  Overhead, the dark limb of a tree extends over the path, connected to a dead tree hidden somewhere in the surrounding fog."
