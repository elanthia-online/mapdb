      "The street travels along a series of great steps that rise toward a terrace in the southeast.  Lofty statues, heavily muscled and hooded so that only sparse features are visible, stand guard atop parapets flanking the steps.  Across from the monumental figures are storefronts offering blades, staves, and bows, cheerfully engaging in the arms trade as if heedless to their colossal overseers."
