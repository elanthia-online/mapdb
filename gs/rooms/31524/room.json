      "Large stands, filled with barrels and casks, line the walls of the clean basement.  Each wooden lid is marked as ale, beer, mead, whiskey, and other types of alcohol.  A smaller rack rests against another wall, its shelves filled with bottles of all shapes, sizes, and colors.  Bins of glassware, and metal and wooden tankards are stacked in the far corner.  A single glaes lantern hangs from a copper hook in the ceiling, its pale light illuminating the cramped, dark area."
