      "Porcelain vases hold sprigs of night-blooming jasmine, the flowers perfuming the air with their honeyed fragrance.  The top of the table is etched with little flowers, their edges dusted with silver as if bathed in a veil of starlight.  Overhead, the ceiling is painted with a mural of a night sky, but with spirals of white petals floating through the dark firmament."
