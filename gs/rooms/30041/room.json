      "Two huge copper urns filled with soil flank the soaring red stone arch leading from the cyclopean edifice onto the open-air terrace.  More planters march along the edges of the esplanade.  They are choked with vegetation that has traded verdure for greyness and bright blossoms for an armor of rime.  Runnels and pockmarks mar the surrounding architecture, which looks to be crumbling in places."
