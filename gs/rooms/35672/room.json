      "Walls of water rise imperiously high to either side, held back as if by magic.  Whatever force binds the ocean seems not limitless in its power, as the water ripples and surges, threatening at any moment to crash in and drown the narrow cleft in a murderous torrent.  The brittle remains of dead starfish and drying kelp are scattered across the way alongside a few anemones leached of their colors and life."
