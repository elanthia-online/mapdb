      "The expanse of ice ends.  A frigid flow of water laps sluggishly at the icy shore, having eaten away the permafrost to reveal black earth beneath.  Fog sweeps low over the flowing water, obscuring all but the vaguest details of what awaits on the far shore.  The skeletal silhouettes of trees occasionally claw through the grey blanket where the river is at its narrowest."
