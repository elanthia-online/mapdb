      "Dockworkers diligently maneuver along the pier, their backs bowed as they haul crates by utilizing a series of straps across their backs.  Foremen sporadically call out orders, causing this section of the pier to have bursts of activity.  Pier 4 is noted to be to the west based on the simple arrow painted into the dock's planks, while a decorative sign nailed to one of the nearby pilings points further south to Pier 5."
