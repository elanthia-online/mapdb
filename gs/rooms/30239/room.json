      "Neatly folded sails and coils of thick hempen rope are stacked along the polished oak floor of the academy.  Along the back, organization has gotten a bit more erratic, sporting several tipped over piles of canvas in various bright colors with thick remnants of rope snaking between them.  Resting on a sturdy teak counter is a large candle emitting a blend of smoky vetiver and citrus that mingles with, but does not eradicate, the ocean smells of the pier."
