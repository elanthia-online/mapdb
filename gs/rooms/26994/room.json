      "Stretching in all directions, the horizon of Liabo can be seen beyond the film of reddish light that is generated by the protective dome high above.  Golden tiles, beautifully constructed and intricately painted with filigreed designs, stretch away from the landing towards craters that pulse with life.  The stars above seem brighter than they do on Elanithia and the inky blackness that they reside in seems overwhelmingly dark and expansive."
