      "This corner of the wall looks over the corner where Barter Alley meets Trade, and a steady stream of patrons visit the shops clustered around the entrance to the southeastern corner tower.  Beyond stands the grassy field of Giantman Path, which is dominated by an ancient oak tree almost as tall as the walls themselves."
