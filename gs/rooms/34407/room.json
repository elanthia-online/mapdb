      "Looking out over the inner garden, a tall arcing window allows the sounds and scents of the jungle to float into the hall.  A golden stand rests next to a carved teak door, displaying a colorful parrot perched on a swing inside a large filigree cage suspended from a golden stand.  A pair of mahogany chairs is placed to either side of a small matching table adorned with a sea glass vase filled with bright exotic flowers.  Draped with azure blue silk, a carved pale mistwood archway capped with a sea glass keystone is recessed at the end of the corridor."
