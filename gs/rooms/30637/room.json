      "A large mahogany bar dominates the north end of this oak-paneled room, dozens of bottles lining the shelves behind it.  A few bar stools are bolted to the ground in front of the bar, while several plush lounge chairs line the walls.  The western wall bears a gold-framed oil painting, adding some decoration and color to this room, and a gold and red tapestry leads east.  Simple wooden tables are spaced several feet apart, offering patrons a place to sit with others and converse."
