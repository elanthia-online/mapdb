      "Tightly bound bundles of dried herbs hang from the ceiling of the canvas tent, the plants spaced out between a pair of rusted iron lanterns that illuminate the small space.  A frayed, dark wool mat lays rolled against the back wall, as well as a number of totems and idols carved from bloodwood and oak.  The center of the area remains meticulously clean, the debris piled up to either side of the tent flap."
