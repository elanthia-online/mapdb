      "Sunlight slants across the corridor, causing shadows to dance through the fragrant smoke of nearby bronze braziers that dispel the heat of the open-air space.  Pine needles litter the space as they drop from a crooked larch that hangs over this section of the inn.  Carved posts support the exposed rafters of the ceiling and act as sentinels as they flank a set of descending steps.  Recessed into one russet-painted wall is a grey-washed wych elm door, which stands open to guests."
