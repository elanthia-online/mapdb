      "Dragging footsteps and accidental bumpings are all that let you know others pass this way too, as the darkness encompasses the hallway completely.  The near-intimate groping of hands is quickly withdrawn as they make contact with flesh instead of ruin walls.  The dirt-limned floor muffles the steps scraping along the passage as shuffling continues in each direction."
