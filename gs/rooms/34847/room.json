      "Half-finished automatons frame the dusty corners of the workshop, their hulking frames suspended by thick, twisted lengths of rope.  Scrawled notes engulf the parchments covering the brocaded walls, the scrolls unfurling down onto the tool-filled workbench, the clutter threatening to tip over the glass lanterns nestled near the edge.  Hooked curtains of oil-stained cloth obscures the stairway, the length bound by iron chains, the same metal forged into a short gate leading towards the twisting hallway."
