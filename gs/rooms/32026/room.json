      "A weed-riddled patch of grass is littered with decrepit gravestones, the cracks along the marble filled with green-black moss that obscures the already illegible carvings across the flat surfaces.  A blackened dwelling stands behind the cemetary, its tall bell tower collapsed across the roof and onto the dusty pathway."
