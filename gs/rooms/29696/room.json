      "Spacious and roomy, the domed tent has an exposed framework of bowed pine saplings that are joined together by canvas ribbons.  Waxed canvas is draped over the manipulated baby trees to create a protective shell against the elements, though a small opening in the ceiling allows smoke from a nearby cooking fire to escape.  Heavy wool and fleece blankets are scattered about the ground, some in comfortable piles for sleeping and others simply to muffle the chill that radiates from the ground."
