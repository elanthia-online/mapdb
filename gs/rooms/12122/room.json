      "A white bier rests in the center of a copse of dead trees.  Four swords stand about it, one at each corner.  Resting upon the cold stone bed is a man.  His grey hair is held back by a golden crown, and his beard flows down his broad chest.  Upon the side of the stone is carved a set of characters.  Most of the letters have been lost to time, leaving only \"---r, K--g of -h- -od-.\""
