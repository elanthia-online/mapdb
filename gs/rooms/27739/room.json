      "The stairs come to an end in this upper room, where a rough construction of planks and reinforced wood forms a small platform giving access to slitted windows in the walls.  A stunted little barrel stands between the gaps of the numerous slitted windows that encircle the area.  One wider window looks down upon the western wall of Icemule Trace, and a knotted rope is tied to a grommet securely fastened to its stony ledge."
