      "This expansive, cave-like room is the workspace and storage for the mausoleum through the invar gate to the south.  In the northeastern quadrant, stacks of brass plates have been lined up beside a sturdy easel.  In the southeast, racks of glowing toadstools sit next to empty pots and a pile of mulch.  On the western side, dwarf-sized stone slabs are stacked next to a wheeled step ladder contraption.  Upright brooms fill a rack near a small steel door in the north wall."
