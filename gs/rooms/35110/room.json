      "Sinew-bound drapes of mottled furs and pelts frame the rough brick walls of the apothecary shop, the thick layers providing additional warmth alongside the blackened iron hearth nestled in the back corner.  Sturdy ironwood shelves cover the available space against the walls, filled with stone jars labeled in aged parchment, the containers nestled in beds of straw.  A mortar-flanked counter sits at the center of the room, its gouged surface covered in a variety of stains concealed by hide-covered tomes."
