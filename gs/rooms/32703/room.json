      "Dark grey granite flecked with deep sapphire blue covers the floor, unembellished save a single silver diamond inlaid in the center of the room.  Silvery haon bookcases line the walls, their edges trimmed in thin hammered silver strips.  A carved haon longbow is mounted on one wall, a silver plaque beneath it."
