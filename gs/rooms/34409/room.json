      "Cushioned with crimson, a carved wooden chair holds court amid several pieces of sheet music that have tumbled from their perch upon a claw-footed silver music stand.  Piles of journals, manuscripts, and books are stacked in, on, and around a large bookcase on one wall, while other books are neatly piled upon the lush golden carpet.  A large open window, near the back, allows sunlight to illuminate the area, though the bulk of the light is blocked by the hanging basket, brimming with jungle blossoms, that is suspended above it."
