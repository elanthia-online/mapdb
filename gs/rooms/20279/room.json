      "Splintered planks of cedar allow precarious travel over the dark waters flowly sluggishly beneath the raised pilings.  Some vegetation threatens to claim its own foothold here, with prolific swamp ferns poking up from below.  Leading further out across the waters, the walkway continues to the east."
