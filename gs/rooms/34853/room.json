      "Piles of bones, some bleached to whiteness and others still with shreds of flesh clinging to them, are scattered around this yard in orderly clumps.  A rough pathway has been organized through the scattered debris to a clearing in the middle of the chaos that holds a short bloodstained table and an overturned mammoth skull with massive yellowed tusks.  A pile of skulls has been assembled into a makeshift crypt, the entrance flanked by blue-flamed torches."
