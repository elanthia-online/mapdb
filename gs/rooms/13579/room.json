      "The broad sweep of the pine floor is interrupted by a large potted fern.  Halfway to the beam ceiling, an intricate knot-worked wall-hanging hangs on one of the plain wooden walls.  An intricately carved ebonwood stand and a plain wooden table are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
