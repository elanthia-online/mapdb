      "Dark glaes windows, their surfaces carved into a dimensional diamond relief, shield the room from the much of the external light, as well as curiosity from passersby.  Empty cobwebs drape across faded black fel walls, their lengths nearly concealing several deep recesses framed in mildewed plaster.  Centered upon an ornate rug covered in layers of soot and dust, is an ebon sarcophagus surrounded by large white pillar candles lofted on wrought iron stands."
