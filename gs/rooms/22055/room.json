    "description": [
      "This room looks like a garden.  Skillfully rendered cloud formations are painted across a sky blue ceiling.  Vines of ivy, intertwined with rare and exotic flowering plants, cling to the posts of a canopied willow-wood bed.  A mirror, nearly lost among the ivy, is like a doorway into a leafy universe.  The deep rug gives the impression of lush, carefully tended grass.  The light reflecting from a crystal mobile suspended from the ceiling scatters colors, like bright tropical birds, throughout."
