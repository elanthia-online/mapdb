      "[The Drowned Boar, Patio]"
    ],
    "description": [
      "A horrible bloated boar statue stands guard over the entrance of the crowded patio, which stinks of sweat, cigar smoke, and the heady sweetness of burning herbs.  Clouds of smoke puff from censers hanging from the low driftwood eaves straining toward the street.  A nearby table, one of the few not crowded with grizzled tradesmen with bloodshot eyes, has a mosaic top patterned with bright bits of colored glass."
