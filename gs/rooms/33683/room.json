      "Splintered beyond repair, an ebonwood banister inlaid with golden filigree hangs precariously from its mounting bracket upon one end of a rotted staircase that lies in splinters around the room.  Narrow windows shed small amounts of moonlight upon a glass and brass display case, which is half hidden in inky darkness below."
