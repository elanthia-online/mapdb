      "Imposing jackal heads of carved ebony stand atop black marble pedestals, lining the walkway into the dark depths of the temple.  A scattering of candles fitfully illuminate the entryway, awakening flecks of gold in the stone like a spray of sharply glittering stars.  Censers along the chamber's perimeter trail poppy smoke in dark, lazy spirals, filling the air with a soporific perfume."
