    "description": [
      "Carved out of the surrounding cream-hued stone, this airy chamber features not a single straight line or sharp angle.  Instead, the pale walls curve out to meet a fanciful, undulate ceiling; their surfaces inlaid with sparkling gemstone chips in whimsical mosaic waves that spiral around the room.  A circular chandelier illuminates the shop, the wares displayed on racks and shelves sparkling in the ambient light.  Two rippled columns flank an azure ombre catenary archway, while a curved asymmetrical door stands at the opposite end."
