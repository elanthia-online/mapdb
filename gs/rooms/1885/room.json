      "This pawnshop seems fairly prosperous and upscale.  It is clean, though somewhat cluttered, and brightly lit.  The counter is made of a local hardwood and is polished to a bright luster.  Despite the obvious efforts to protect the counter top, a few scars tell of heavy usage.  A small pile of weapons is neatly stacked to one side while one of the assistants busily records their receipt."
