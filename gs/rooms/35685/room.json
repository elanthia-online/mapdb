    "description": [
      "Sprawled across the disc's northernmost verges, its sinuous form following the curve of the monument's rounded edge, is a statue of a singularly gargantuan serpent.  Its immense body, carved from silver-veined black stone with uncanny attention to the details of scales and powerful musculature, is twisted as if in agony.  Its coils nearly conceal a ragged gash along its underbelly where scales have been torn away to reveal yielding flesh beneath.  Beneath the statue, the ground is pocked and pitted."
