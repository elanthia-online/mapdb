      "Warm and dimly lit, the small store smells of fresh baked breads, fragrant herbs, and a hint of firewood.  The cobblestone walls support a series of floor-to-ceiling shelves along the windowless eastern side, the well-made structures spanning the entire space, while a stucco and brick corner fireplace is opposite.  Mosaic tiles surround the fireplace in an expanding ring that invades the hardwood floors.  Occupying the center of the space, a broad brick red barn door table is laden with the shop's offerings."
