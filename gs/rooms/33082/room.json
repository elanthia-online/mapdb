      "The expansive deck is stained obsidian here, painted with a bright red dagger-pierced heart and crossed viridian acantha leaves.  A polished modwir houseboat is secured to the outer edge of the flotilla and protected by several cannons, and a series of painted buoys is coiled near the interior edge.  Dozens of nets with crystalline blue fishing floats are piled neatly between racks of secured spears and tridents."
