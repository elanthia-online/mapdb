      "Murky water spreads across the area in dark pools, the still surface unbroken except for the occasional stray bubble.  A few small patches of land have escaped the water's reach, clumps of sickly-looking grass clinging to them.  A mild stench of decay hangs across the area, the putrid smell accompanied by the deep croaking of frogs.",
