      "Under a cloudless night sky, a small clearing is visible between some trees.  In the center of the clearing, a circle of stones is filled with charred twigs and leaves.  A makeshift hammock is stretched between two tree trunks and is held in place by some of the cord-like vines.",
      "Thick cord-like vines dangle overhead from various trees and drape down to partially conceal a small clearing.  In the center of the clearing, a circle of stones is filled with charred twigs and leaves.  A makeshift hammock is stretched between two tree trunks and is held in place by some of the cord-like vines."
