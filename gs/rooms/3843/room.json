      "The stones paving the street have been recently painted, their hues varying from cool shades of blue, green, and purple to bright gold and silver.  Adopting their festive appearance, the trim along the nearby cottages has been painted in the same fashion.  Flurries of colorful silk ribbons, tied to the lanterns flanking the street, dance in the cool breeze.  A rough flagstone path slips between the rows of hedges and into a nearby garden.",
