      "Blanketing the entire stable area is a thick layer of hay that offers a subtle carpeted feel to an otherwise hard and unforgiving foundation.  Occasional drafts carry questionable aromas that seem to originate from the surrounding stalls.  Artistically painted murals decorate the tall stone walls and portray historic dwarven battles led by mounted soldiers."
