      "Turtle grass thins into wisps around a broad hollow, where smooth shale rises in curved ledges to form a sheltering bowl.  Pockets of trapped bubbles cling to the undersides of the stone, drifting free in slow, silvery trails.  Warm currents whisper from hidden lava tubes below, stirring the silt in lazy spirals.  A soft moan hums through the water, carried by whirls that descend from unseen openings above.  A polished nacre mirror and a barnacle-encrusted shell-shaped sign lie half-buried in the sandy floor."
