      "Polished to a dark shine, a massive ironwood table stands surrounded by several high-backed chairs in the center of the gathering hall.  Diffused light from a dark crystal chandelier set with slender yellow candles illuminates several finely-woven tapestries hanging from the walls, their bright threads adding color to the dark stone.  Set to one side is a crystal-topped cart holding a variety of refreshments."
