      "A stout central pole of white oak supports the high canopy of this airy tent.  Canvas-draped tables have been neatly arranged around the shop to allow ample space between them to accommodate crowds.  Placed prominently in front, a whimsical tortoise sculpture greets would-be customers, crafted into the bulky bodies of three tortoises balancing atop each other, the topmost holding a large sign in its beak."
