      "Two huge toadstools in large stone pots illuminate a large, comfortable room.  Dusky brown granite benches line two of the marble walls, facing each other across the sapphire carpet.  On one wall, a brass arch allows exit to the corridor outside, while on the other wall a curtain provides entrance to the locker area."
