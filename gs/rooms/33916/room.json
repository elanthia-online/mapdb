      "Large, rectangular stone blocks shore up this round room covered by a crystal-inlaid dome.  Reaching to the sky, the statue of a winged humanoid woman stands at its center.  Between clusters of glowing, potted toadstools, a wide invar gate cordons off a stone yard opposite an arched ironwood door in the southern wall.  Beyond the statue to the west, a wide plaque-lined hallway leads deeper into the tomb, while to the east, a simple portal leads back out to Zul Logoth."
