    "description": [
      "Crafted with one back wall, which is covered with a brilliantly colored wall hanging, the hut is otherwise exposed to the elements on all other sides.  A hive-like roof of tightly bound palm fronds provides overhead protection, while the floor is merely packed dirt and mud.  Settled in the center of the floor is a crude metal casting device, and several molds lie on the ground next to it.  Several woven baskets filled with copper bracelets, necklaces, and belts are lined up against the hut's wall."
