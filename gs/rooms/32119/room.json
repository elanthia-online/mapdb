      "The north and south walls here are formed from the cracked and splintered section of a ship's hold, buried underground and packed with mud where the bow and aft would join if it were still a seaworthy craft.  A length of mossy rigging dangles from the edges of a vine-covered hole above a massive flat red-spotted mushroom, and a scattering of overturned crates litter the angular, convex wooden floor."
