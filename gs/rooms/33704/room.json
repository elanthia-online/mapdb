      "White marble floors and cabinets serve as a backdrop for several colorful touches in the kitchen.  An island with a soft blue base and grey marble countertop provides a convenient place for prepared food and drinks to be served.  Behind it, a countertop with a white wash basin and enameled stove serves as a food preparation area while a silver filigree bin sits to the side.  Overhead, a delicate silver chandelier provides illumination over the workspace and island."
