    "description": [
      "Cascading blossoms in all of the hues of the sky at sunrise, from cheery saffron to sedate ash rose, erupt from the foliage of the trumpet tree.  They litter the platforms suspended from its sturdy branches, turning them into a road of dazzling colors.  Dappled sunlight filters through the leaves above, creating shifting patterns on woven mats and uncured hides scattered across the crude planks of wood."
