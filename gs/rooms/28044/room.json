      "Adjacent a stand topped with gaudy accessories and surcoats, the accoutrements of a knight, over-aggrandized in style, are heaped upon a mannequin in the mid-forward area of the stall.  Overly lavish and ostentatiously decorated banners of gold and green hues line the stall, and two merchants who look more like self-important snobs than hawkers stride back and forth, at turns completely ignoring and striking knightly poses for patrons as they shop.",
