      "Freestanding wooden racks and shelves display an array of trinkets and toys, dividing the space into several aisles.  Along the outdoor path, various townsfolk browse the goods for purchase.  Vividly colored bolts of cloth are propped up against every available surface, some carelessly resting an edge in the snow."
