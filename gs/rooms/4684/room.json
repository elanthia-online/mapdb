      "Lined on both sides with fallen trees, the steep path along the mountain seems well maintained and moderately easy to travel along.  Cross sections of logs, set into the dirt at the foot of this section of the trail, serve as crude steps to proceed down into the gorge.  A steep trail leading up lends no aid to those ascending the switchback."
