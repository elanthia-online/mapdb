    "description": [
      "The sweet smell of tabac permeates the room, and wisps of smoke drift lazily in the air.  Very few scuffmarks mar the surface of the polished wood floor, upon which padded chairs and tables are deliberately arranged around a dais that is three steps high.  A wooden podium rests in its center and is the focal point of the room.  Carved from wood and made to resemble a bear's paw is a box filled with clay pipes and set on the mantel above the fireplace."
