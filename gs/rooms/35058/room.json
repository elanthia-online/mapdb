    "description": [
      "Secured by a pair of gilded doors, a long gallery runs the length of the structure.  Its high granite walls and black walnut floors magnify the slightest sound, from the whispers of traders engaged in quiet dealings to the hasty patter of runners' footsteps as they carry messages to and from the guild hall.  Though one wall is given over to large picture windows overlooking the bustle of Fortune Street, the other holds foreign artworks in dozens of disparate styles."
