      "Gentle babbling from the swiftly flowing stream fills the humid air along the bank.  A small pile of flat, rounded stones is stacked next to a carved granite bench that overlooks the stream.  Colorful blooms of assorted flowers provide contrast with the stark greenery of the jungle.  Glass-paneled lanterns hang from iron hooks attached to trees along the path leading to the stream."
