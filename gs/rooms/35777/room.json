      "Pebbles form a winding path between stands of ginger and hibiscus.  Nearby, tall coconut palms lean over a driftwood fence in graceful arcs.  A polished brass lantern with blue-tinted glass hangs from a driftwood post.  Weaving through ferns and palms, a crushed seashell walkway offers a soft, shimmering trail."
