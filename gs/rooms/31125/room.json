      "Polished maplewood floors sweep forward dramatically in this spacious formal dining area.  It is a gathering place House members use upon formal occasions.  Nearly spanning the length of the room is a polished table made of inlaid dir wood.  A smaller table sits joined to it at one end, reserved for Aspis officers and their distinguished guests.  To the west, a short hall leads to kitchens."
