      "Glass-encased lamps are scattered between the antler-framed rack and ebony stand, the containers casting shadows across the charcoal-drawn sketches displayed along the planked walls.  A velvet-draped birdcage stands in the back corner, its occupant occasionally rattling the gilded confines hidden beneath the thick curtains.  The faint scent of burnt wood and aged whiskey permeates the air, the haze swirling across the carpeted floor."
