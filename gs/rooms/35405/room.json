      "Cobalt blue tiles gleam beneath the flickering glow of nearby torches, their deep hues darkened where shadows gather between the pillars.  Awnings ripple faintly in the night air, their colors softened in the dim light as they cast shifting silhouettes across the tables below.  Quiet voices drift beneath the arches, blending with the distant sounds of the evening market.  To the south, a fountain's steady flow echoes through the stillness, marking the slow passage of the night."
