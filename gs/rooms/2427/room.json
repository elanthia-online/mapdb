      "As it passes by a half-timbered pale grey stone guildhall, the straight march of the cobblestone road offers a view of snowy foothills beyond the town's walls.  Over the heads of fur-clad merchants from Pinefar and robed sisters leading groups of fresh-faced initiates out of town, the snow-swept wilds are dotted with evergreens and dark rock.  Glimpses of a pale stone abbey in the extreme distance are almost entirely lost to the cloud cover.  To the south, the slate-shingled roof of Clovertooth Hall rises high into the sky.",
      "Merchants and adventurers crowd this gravel path, talking and laughing as they stroll along.  Off to the south, a stately white dome rises high into the sky."
