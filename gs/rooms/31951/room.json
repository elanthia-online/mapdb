      "Hanging ivy drapes like a veil from the terraces of the numerous homes populating the street, dripping crimson-throated flowers down their plaster exteriors.  Iron-caged lanterns hang from posts scattered along a path that cleaves its way through trees in varying stages of rebirth, leading up the hillside to an austere, circular limestone keep.  From the summit, the lofty structure looms forebodingly over the grey-tinted neighborhood.",
