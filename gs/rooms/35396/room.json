      "Narrow paths extend northward, linking this space with its northern counterpart, while to the south, sea grass shifts in the breeze, growing in thick tufts between grey and white pebbles.  Fragments of crushed seashells catch the light, scattered in irregular patterns.  Beyond the grassy screen, the ocean stretches toward the horizon, waves a constant presence.  Along the west, animal pens line the edge, their colored awnings marked with homestead symbols.  Eastward, marble steps rise to the colonnade."
