    "description": [
      "Mist creeps through the streets of the blighted settlement on cautious tendrils, as if reticent to disturb the sepulchral feel of the ruin.  Burnt out longhouses flank the once grand arch marking the entrance of the village, peppering the air with their charred odor.  The facade of one longhouse has collapsed backward, but the entrance to the other is merely blocked by burnt rubble.  A huge gigas corpse dangles precariously through one of the windows flanking its blocked entryway."
