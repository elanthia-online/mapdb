    "description": [
      "A trio of round, brass-encased portholes along the port side offer unfettered views of the seas, the moon shining on the crests of her waves.  A cushioned bench runs the length of the portholes, and a hammock hangs along the starboard side, swaying gently with the rocking movement of the ship.  Suspended from the center of the ceiling by a short chain is a half-shuddered iron lantern, oscillating to the ocean's rhythm.  Hanging from a nail next to a bow companionway is a small piece of mirror with desilvered edges, and tucked into a corner next to a stern companionway is a copper urn."
