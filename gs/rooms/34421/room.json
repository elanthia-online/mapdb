      "Swathes of pale blue satin line the walls of the elegant shop, falling to the ground in pools of cascading fabric.  Covering the white marble floor is a plush carpet patterned with specks of azure and gold.  A trio of marbled stone shelves are spread with an assortment of cutlery, while several glaesine cases display a variety of glassware and place settings.  Rows of crystal lanterns hang above, illuminating the displays in their gentle glow."
