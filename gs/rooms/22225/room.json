      "Heavy drapes are drawn aside, allowing ample light into the room.  Though lacking in personal touches, rich furnishings make this a welcoming retreat for visiting dignitaries and scholars.  A large desk near the window offers ample workspace, and the carved thanot featherbed promises comfortable repose after a long day.  A bouquet of fresh flowers graces the bureau, and a thick carpet covers the floor."
