    "description": [
      "An ornately carved oak bench circles the trunk of the willow, offering a place to rest and a sheltered refuge from the noise and activities farther aft.  Here one can enjoy the quietude provided by the protective branches and the gentle lapping of the waves just a few feet away.  Visible through the willow leaves, partygoers engaged in animated conversations and quiet pairs intent upon each other follow the flagstone path to and from the domed hall."
