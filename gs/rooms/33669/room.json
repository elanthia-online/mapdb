    "description": [
      "Shattered furniture, tattered tapestries, and fractured windows litter the niche with their broken and misshapen shapes.  Chains dangle from above to support candelabra that are devoid of votives and creak as the air moves through the space.  Heavy layers of dust cover the floor, though a set of footprints in the thick debris leads towards a glass and brass display case that has been pulled free of the litter."
