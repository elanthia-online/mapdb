      "Patches of unkempt grass threaten to overwhelm the wire-framed garden beds, the tangle of thorned vines and drooping flower heads creeping towards the chipped marble fountain at the center of the broken cobblestones.  An ivory-colored statue stands within the curved bowl of the fountain, the masculine form's hands cupped upwards as rivulets of water drip down into the basin.  A copse of decaying trees drape over the far corner of the garden, the greyish yellow bark peeling downwards in flayed strips."
