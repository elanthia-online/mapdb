      "Balanced precariously atop the branches of a towering manna gum tree, a small lookout built from rough branches surveys the rocky landscape below.  Faded symbols scratched crudely into the wood are smeared with the sticky juices of a strangler fig, staining them an unsightly reddish brown.  Winds whisper through the branches of the old tree, making the watch post sway and dance like a drunken sailor."
