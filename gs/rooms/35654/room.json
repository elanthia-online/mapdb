      "Sinuous lines of salt crystal create patterns on the driftwood planks, their grit lending texture to the smooth-worn wood.  The docks rock as sapphire waves slap at their pilings, but the thick clusters of black-shelled mussels seem little perturbed by the ocean's tantrums.  Their briny scent is intense, even contrasted with the salty sea air."
