      "No wider than a couple of feet, it has become increasingly difficult to maneuver along this sturdy strip of stone that cuts in and out of the mountain's natural shape.  Rocks crunch loudly underfoot, and smaller pebbles roll off the ledge and meet an early demise on the ground below.  Fortunately, a small clearing is a short jump over a deep crevice and should provide suitable accommodations for a brief rest."
