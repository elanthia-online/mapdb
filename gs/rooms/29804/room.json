      "Candles flicker in a tiered antler chandelier hanging from the rafters in this large, open room.  Smooth black walnut floors give way to an imposing dark stone fireplace opposite a pair of black willow doors.  A wide pine bench piled high with plush furs stretches beneath an expansive window along the western wall, providing a cozy respite and a magnificent view of the ice plains beyond.  To the east, a verdant woven silk tapestry hangs upon the wall between matching bone-carved sconces."
