      "Slanting downward, the walls of the cavern are rough with coral and sponge.  Flow-worn stone forms soft ledges along the sides, with root-like seaweed trailing loosely above.  An old sea chest rests half-buried in sand, its surface mottled and worn.  A narrow stone shelf juts alongside a trailing curtain of pale kelp.  From the ceiling, strands of filament algae hang in silence, swaying gently in the unseen current."
