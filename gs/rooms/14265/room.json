    "description": [
      "A sharply curving staircase has been carved from the natural rock at the foundations of the manor.  The staircase descends from a shadowy grey arch at the top and ends abruptly at a still sheet of water, broken by several upraised stepping stones.  There is no light in the immediate area, but a somber glow from across the water illuminates the way enough to allow for only slightly perilous passage."
