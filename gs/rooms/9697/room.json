      "The trail reaches an impasse of tree trunks on the south.  To the north and south, it winds around a huge boulder, sitting in the shelter of the leafy boughs like a sultan beneath a black canopy.  The surface of the rock is a rich pattern of lichens, with ferns edging its foot in a lazy fringe.",
