      "Lush, pale silks cascade in luxuriant spills from the high domed roof of the antechamber, each graced with a scant spiral of crimson petals.  The floor of red-veined white marble tiles radiates outward from a dagger-pierced heart formed from tesserae at the room's center.  Drifting in the breeze beckoning through the entrance, the silks reveal glimpses of silvered manacles hanging from arched recesses in the walls."
