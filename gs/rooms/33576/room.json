      "Stacks of blackwood crates surround the entirety of the area, with additional ones cluttering the ground.  Amongst the crates are remnants of tree branches, their sticks, twigs, and leaves now dry and brittle.  Along the tent's fur-covered walls hang moss-filled brown-tinged glass spheres strung on braided copper and bronze filiments showing signs of patination."
