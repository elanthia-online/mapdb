      "The broad sweep of the ceramic tile floor is interrupted by an open-mawed greater vruul statue.  Halfway to the yellow plaster ceiling, a midnight blue rising phoenix tapestry hangs on one of the gently curved stucco walls.  A jewel-inlaid caddy and an oval-shaped speckled marble counter are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
