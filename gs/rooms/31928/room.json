      "Gleaming dark silk woven with climbing roses is draped over the ashen stone walls of the cool, tapered chamber.  The cobblestone flooring widens into a half-moon toward the back, highlighting an austere pale monir ambry lit by gently curled ironworked sconces filled with ivory candles.  Nestled into a removed corner, a carved heart of ebony cabinet sits on a lush burgundy carpet with satin tassels.  The delicate scents of petrichor and incense smoke elusively linger in the air."
