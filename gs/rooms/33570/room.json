      "Lamplight plays upon the rippled oilcloth of the tent's walls, lending them an oily appearance that is slightly rainbow-swirled.  Large posts keep the ceiling at bay for even the tallest of guests, while mismatched rugs scattered on the ground hide most of the surrounding mud and grass.  Sitting kitty-corner to one section of the tent, a copper-bound worn oak footlocker sits with its lid thrown wide to display the pressed and folded linens within."
