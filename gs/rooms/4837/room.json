      "Three small lean-tos are nestled between a pair of towering pine trees.  A sprawling thanot bush has been carefully cut-away, remnants and pieces of its wood woven together lie at the opening of a lean-to.  A crude cutting knife is impaled in a piece of the wood, perhaps awaiting future use.",
