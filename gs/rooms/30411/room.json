      "The trunk of a solitary fossilized tree pokes up from the ocean floor below through the surface of the blue-grey water.  Its height above the breakwater about that of two average giantmen and its girth approximately that of a sideways halfling, the grey stone hulk resembles nothing so much as a pillar intended to pierce the sky above and thus allow a fleeting glimpse to the unreachable stretch of ocean beyond the western boundary of Charl's Teeth."
