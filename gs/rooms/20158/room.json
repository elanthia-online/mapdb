      "Varnished, glistening mahogany walls enclose the area in the warm reddish-brown hue of the wood's natural stain, which is easily illuminated by the flickering sconces dotting them here and there.  Two long shelves line the eastern wall, each one perfectly sanded and sealed in heavy lacquer.  A tall chair rests in the corner with an upholstered footrest positioned before it, and on the opposite end, a large oak chest overflows with a variety of unkempt male dolls."
