      "A flimsy silken swath draped between the expansive branches of mahogany trees shelters this small clearing.  To one side, a table of refreshments tempts one to partake, while opposite, several wicker chairs surround an umbrella-topped wooden table.  Masters and students mill around, mingling in the congenial breeze provided by large fans suspended from the trees.  To the north, an arch leads into a warren of workrooms.  To the south, the offices of the masters await."
