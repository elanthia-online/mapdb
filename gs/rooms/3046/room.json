      "Level ground makes the path more defined as the snow has been tamped down to create a firm base.  Constant traffic packs the soft powder into a thick cushion, slightly slippery from the daily melting and nightly refreezing at the edge of the glacier.  Spidery tracings of snow are plastered along the stone wall guarding the town, a result of wind kicking up the drifts.",

Constant traffic packs the soft powder into a thick cushion, slightly slippery from the daily melting and nightly refreezing at the edge of the glacier.  Gusts of wind carry the loose snow covering the top of the nearby town wall up into feathery, ice crystal plumes silhouetted against the indigo night."
