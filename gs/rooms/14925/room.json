      "Circling perfectly here is a small stand of aspens, the undersides of the spade-like leaves a soft silver in the moonlight.  At the center, a large river stone sits, its top flat like an altar and holding many offerings from those who have visited.  The trail continues behind the grove, running alongside the creek that rings the valley floor.",
