      "The arched ceiling ends in a flat wall whose entire face is made of glass framed in arches of pure white ora.  Beyond the glass is a long row of greenery interspersed with flowers and shrubs.  Sunken into the floor is a lounge with tables and soft couches.  Intricate tapestries decorate the walls with scenes of the struggle to free the undead."
