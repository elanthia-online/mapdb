      "In the shadowed recesses of a grotto, the pier extends gracefully into the tranquil waters as it departs the primary dock structure.  A weathered wooden sign, hanging from a rope, swings gently in the breeze, marked with the name of the grotto.  On one side, a collection of small, intricate seashells is displayed in a small netted pouch, their delicate forms a contrast to the rugged surroundings."
