    ],
    "description": [
      "A circle of brush surrounds the mound top like a monk's tonsure, leaving its crest bare but for a number of weeds and an old rust-covered catapult.  Over the top of the brush, one can spy the Tempest River as it disappears over the falls and the resulting cloud of ever-present cloaking mist.  Even further beyond, the sight of a turtle egg-shaped island and its odd array of businesses and homes can be seen.  Standing tall out of the weeds, the abandoned catapult points toward the town."
