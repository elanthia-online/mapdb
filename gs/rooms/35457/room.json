      "Tucked behind a carved stone pillar, a quiet alcove opens into a narrow recess lined with deep wooden shelves.  One side holds neat rows of instructional tomes, their spines worn and titles stamped in silver leaf.  Opposite, velvet-lined niches cradle medallions bearing the names and crests of past masters, each polished to a soft gleam.  The air here is still, carrying the faint scent of aged parchment and brass."
