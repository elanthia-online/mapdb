      "A rough-edged corridor branches off from the main path along the uneven rim, descending toward an unseen chamber.  Wafts of heated air, heavy-laden with a cloyingly sweet odor reminiscent of fresh honey, sigh from the mouth of the passage.  Several clusters of crystal sprout from the inner wall of the rim, pulses of light rising and falling in their depths in perfect rhythm."
