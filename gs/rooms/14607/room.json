      "Light shines into the end of this hallway where boards lie scattered beneath a window.  The boards have been clawed and gouged, but whether they were broken in from the outside or pulled loose from the inside isn't clear.  A chestnut door and a birch door face each other across the hallway just a few paces from the corridor's east end."
