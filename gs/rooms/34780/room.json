      "Pale green liquid pulses as it flows over the walls in thick rivulets, to collect in a central pool recessed in the stone floor of the chamber.  Steam rises up from the glowing ooze as it ripples and swells, seemingly by its own accord.  A verdant haze shifts and moves through the air, adding to the iridescence."
