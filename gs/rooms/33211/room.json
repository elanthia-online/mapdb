      "A large bookcase sits against one wall, filled with many leather-covered volumes.  The hardwood floor has been covered with a rich, thick handwoven carpet.  Scattered in front of the large marble hearth are several well-cushioned chairs, drawn close together as if to facilitate a long, comfortable debate."
