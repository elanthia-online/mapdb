      "Sheer curtains of white gauze cut across the room, hanging from alum-linked chains and splitting the pavilion into three sections.  The floor is freshly trimmed grass, thick and dark green, interrupted by pots of exotic lily flowers.  There is a metal arbor trellis covered in passion flowers arched over a marble fountain, flower petals raining down into the fountain's bowls below."
