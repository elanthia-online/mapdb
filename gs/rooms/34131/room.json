      "Slate rock peeks out and forms a hazardous looking stairway on the hilltop, where snow and ice covers the exposed roots of trees that dangle precariously over the ledge.  Icicles of noteworthy size suspended on the tips of branches sway ominously back and forth.  Along the overly used trail, ice has formed in many of the deep grooves in the ground, making travel difficult."
