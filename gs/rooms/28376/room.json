      "Richly textured brocade the color of fresh cream covers the upper part of the walls, giving way to waist-high dark felwood panels below.  Narrow border carpets travel the length of the corridor on either side, fading subtly from solid black at the southern end to a deep crimson as they reach the northern balcony.  A small round table at the midpoint holds a crystal vase filled with a mixture of mournblooms and roses, directly beneath a colorful tapestry."
