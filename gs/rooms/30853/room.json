      "High above the sparkling waters of the atoll, several circular platforms join together at an enormous square platform, each dotted with tiny wattle and stone hovels.  Central to the area sits an elevated stone box, its massive interior filled with rich soil.  A collection of benches surround the box, their dark stone surfaces polished clean.",
