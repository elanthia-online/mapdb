      "A pair of hugely fat, monstrously drunken dwarves shout at each other from a distance of perhaps five feet -- as close to each other as their girths will allow.  Though it's not clear what their argument is about, it involves a lot of arm flailing, spluttering, spitting and the occasional kick to the shin.  Now and again, one or the other stops to drink from the small keg they share."
