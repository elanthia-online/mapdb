      "Little more than a walled-off closet, this section of the wagon is separated from the others by a thin panel of wood that stretches the wagon's length.  Open crates overflowing with bolts of cloth are piled next to half-full racks of clothing, overflow inventory for the showroom.  An open space in the room's center has been lined with a circular hide rug.  A narrow wooden door in the paneling leads back to the showroom."
