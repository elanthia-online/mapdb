      "Racks of metallic-threaded gowns line the walls, each garment hanging in graceful drapes that shimmer with the movement of the air.  Overhead, a canopy of copper, silver, and gold threads forms a delicate web that spans the ceiling.  At key junctions, moonstones carved to resemble bundled prey emit a soft glow, casting a moonlit sheen across the space.  An open wooden door leads into a candlelit workroom."
