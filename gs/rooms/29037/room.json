      "Rough oak boards spread across the framework of the pier, while painted white cork bumpers offer a buffer along the edges, to prevent damage to ships tied-off nearby.  Three tie pilings on the on the western side are evenly spaced to allow for ease of docking and stand opposite a pair on the southeast.  A large white sign that reads \"Pier 1 - Slips 1-5\" is nailed to a support post."
