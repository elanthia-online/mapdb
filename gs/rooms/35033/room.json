      "Several spars of basalt lie in a broken tumble, the standing stones toppled by the shaking of the shiftless earth.  Carved with symbols and shapes, they are worn almost smooth by the years and the ungentle caress of the winds.  Several are half-buried in drifts of falling ash, and risk being lost to view entirely."
