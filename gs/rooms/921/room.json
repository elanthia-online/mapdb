      "The twisting tunnel opens up into a huge cavern, its ultimate height lost in the darkness above.  An awe-inspiring waterfall, the roar of its passage emitting a thunderous wave of sound through the tunnels, cascades into a shadowy pit at the bottom of the cavern.  Thick clouds of water vapor reach upward from the pit, their curling, snake-like forms dissipating into the cold air."
