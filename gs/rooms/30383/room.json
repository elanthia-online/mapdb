      "Water smacks up against the crag-filled walls of this recess, occasionally causing a jet of seawater to shoot into the air, misting the surroundings.  A strong current makes navigation here difficult, constantly pushing towards the rock wall.  Moonlight shines down upon the water, glinting silver on the surface."
