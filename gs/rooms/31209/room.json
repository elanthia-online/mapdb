      "The most striking object in this circular room is the solid glaes column that rises from the center of the room to the ceiling.  It is apparent that this supports some great weight.  Floor-to-ceiling windows allow the light to stream in on the pool that surrounds the column.  Small benches and chairs line the tiled flooring, and a service bar circles the great column.",
