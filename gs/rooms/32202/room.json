      "Glittering in the light of dozens of votives, delicate sea glass and mirror fragment charms hang from the exposed rafters of the wagon and fill it with dancing lights.  Daffodil yellow shutters are closed tightly against the damp air of the neighborhood, while heavy blankets are piled high upon a bed built into three walls.  Lacquered pegs and wrought iron hooks hold various charms, their long ends dangling over wicker basket filled with yarn balls."
