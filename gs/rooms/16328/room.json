      "This tiny room has floor to ceiling shelves filled with bandages, salves, bottles of medicines, and various other things a healer might use.  Overhead hangs a brass lantern providing light to the area.  A small table rests against the only shelf-less wall, with a spindly, pale blue-cushioned oak chair in front of it.  Upon the table is a small brazier, with a light green liquid bubbling gently in the cauldron upon it."
