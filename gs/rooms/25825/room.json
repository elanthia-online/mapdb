      "Stretching across the broad, flat expanse at the center of the island, a grey and purple awning provides shelter from the rough winds that rip through the area.  Colorful urns, filled with palm trees, tropical plants, and flowers, create a verdant wall on three sides of the protective structure and act as an anchor to the blanket stretched between them."
