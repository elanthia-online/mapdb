    "description": [
      "Padded benches line five of the latticework walls of this six-cornered building.  An open arch in the remaining wall leads out to the surrounding fields.  A marble statue carved into the indistinct shape of a woman stands near the center of the small room, forming the back of a vine-covered stone altar.  She carries in her hands a large jug which pours out a stream of sparkling water that spills over a bed of carved stone flowers and seeps away into the cracks and crannies in the floor."
