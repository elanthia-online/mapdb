      "Wispy tendrils of fragrant smoke unfurl from sticks of incense on a stand beside a feather bed.  Sturdy chairs, hand-carved in botanical themes, surround an aged oak table centered in the humble abode.  Perched atop the table rests an assortment of glass-paned lanterns, some cradling flitting will-o-wisps within their clear embrace, others with tiny doors ajar, awaiting new inhabitants to brighten the home.  In contrast to a tall witchwood door at the front entry, a tiny exit, looking suspiciously like a mousehole, leads out the back."
