      "Light-toned wood forms the doors of each stall, their hinges and handles a dark contrast of blackened wrought iron.  High above, a series of long windows greet the ceiling, their open faces providing a view of the sky above.  Along the southern wall, a series of racks house a variety of tools necessary for maintaining the cleanliness of the stables."
