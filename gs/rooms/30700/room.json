      "A sealed, glass decanter filled with hundreds of old coins sits at the center of this round table.  The coins are of different sizes, shapes, and metals, but are all out of use and basically worthless, making a very interesting, if not valuable, centerpiece.  Wooden chairs sized for all races surround the table."
