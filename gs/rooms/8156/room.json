      "The track meanders up to a door set into the vertical face of an immense boulder buried in the hillside.  Mighty hinges are bolted into the rock sill, supporting the heavy oak of the portal.  Occupying the door's center is a large bronze knocker cast in the shape of a bee.  It launches out, wings outstretched, as if it had been frozen in mid-flight.  The insect's expression looks ferocious in such an exaggerated context."
