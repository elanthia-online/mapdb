    "description": [
      "Large stacks of crates isolate this area of the flotilla, creating a narrow path west back to the main structure.  To the north, the way is blocked by an oversized building, its exterior covered in various bits of flotsam and jetsam, and a ramshackle ironwood man-of-war is thoroughly lashed to one outer edge.  Reinforced connections bridge this section to the outermost edge of the flotilla in a narrow but sturdy walkway, creating an easily defensible position."
