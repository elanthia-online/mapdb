      "Towering cypress trees stand in precise rows, their narrow spires forming a sheltered corridor along a straight path.  Beneath them, blue shale pavers create a firm walkway, their edges softened by creeping white star flowers.  Wild windflowers and gerbera daisies bloom in scattered bursts of color, contrasting against the deep green shade.  Wisteria vines form an arch over the colonnade's entrance, while to the south, the path leads directly to a dome-roofed tholos, its white pillars rising against the sea."
