      "Sunlight floods into the room, gently diffusing through the numerous blown glass globes hanging in the expansive, wall-sized window, creating watery projections of blue light across the room.  A pillow-strewn window seat spans the width of the room, making a cozy place to rest with a far-reaching view of the treetops outside.  A peacock blue ceramic pot sits to one side, resting at the corner of a hand-painted canvas screen."
