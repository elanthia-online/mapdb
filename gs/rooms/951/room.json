      "A distant peal of thunder, or perhaps a trick of the wind as it howls through some unknown cavern, echoes with a deep, resounding tone.  The sound, trapped by the high walls of the pass, reverberates for a few moments and then fades to silence.  The stone walls remain motionless and stoic, as if accustomed to these frequent, audible outbursts of the dark heavens.",
