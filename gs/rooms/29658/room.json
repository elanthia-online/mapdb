      "Supported by a rough oak post, the floor of the canvas structure is hardpacked dirt with sprigs of grass that are yellowing where the heavy walls pool in loose folds.  Bright white lattices form a wall that stretches to the east, its face covered with a variety of metallic hooks and rough oak pegs, while a series of pine barrels create a line that trails to the south.  A small bench in the center of the space is filled with a variety of embossing tools, as well as a few small baskets of needles, thread, and embroidery hoops."
