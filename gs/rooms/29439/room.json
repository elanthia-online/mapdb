      "Sputtering candles hanging from brass sconces provide scant light in the cluttered entrance to the pavilion.  Layered yierka hides covered with indecipherable chalk markings provide shelter from the wind, though some occasional snowflakes drift through the entrance flap.  A wooden plank resting upon overturned hay-packed crates forms an impromptu shelf against the back wall, and several wire baskets hang from the ceiling suspended by lengths of knotted rope."
