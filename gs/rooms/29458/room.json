      "The air here is hot and suffocating, stinking of sulfur, sweat, and other strong odors.  A series of glowing red runes in the floor encircles a rough stone altar, and the granite of the ceiling has been carved into an explosion of thick sculptured tentacles.  Hanging from bronze hooks on one of the walls is an assortment of filthy blades, hammers, and tongs."
