      "Shaleflare moss covers the rocky seabed, providing soft footing and faint light from its luminescent nodes.  Numerous glasstide roses grow along the cavern wall at the rear of the alcove, each flower shimmering in cerulean and silver.  A small bed of kelp grows up amongst several mossy rocks."
