      "Moving up away from the main trail, the path meanders back and forth between stony outcrops and large boulders.  The foliage begins to thin out, the ground covered with rocks and dirt layered with fallen needles from the sparce stands of fir trees.  Several piles of debris gather at the bottom of the eroding mountainside."
