      "In the center of the path near the top of the hill rests an irregular granite boulder with lines of dark moss tracing old carvings across its surface.  Further up the hill to the west, a black obelisk thrusts up against the night sky beside the bulk of a great circular tower.  The worn track spirals steeply downhill to the southeast alongside a shallow gully.",
