    "description": [
      "The Aria table rises from its narrow foot with elegance, the pedestal carved in fine detail.  Beginning with a narrow circumference, it flares as it lifts, until it finally concludes at the carved, circular top.  Across the teak tabletop is another masterful carving, depicting a complex series of interweaving musical staffs with accompanying notes and accents.  A large conch shell has been converted into a lantern, which sits at the table's center."
