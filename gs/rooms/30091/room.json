      "Oil lamps with inverted conical shades hang directly over the merchandise displays situated about the interior of the pavilion, providing ample light under which the goods for sale can be examined, while leaving the rest of the space crowded by dim shadows.  Tucked into the only well-lit corner is a small round table with a discreet vellum note card posted among the wares, and off to the side is a rack of dark metal hangers."
