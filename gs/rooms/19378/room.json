      "Banners and ribbons flutter gently in the seaborne breeze, their colorful ends anchored to the high pilings that surround the pier.  Polished brass lanterns stand upon either side of an enormous oak frame that arcs over a pair of smooth wooden steps that lead down the docks.  Supported by bamboo, a painted easel-style sign provides information for all to read."
