      "Buildings grow sparse as a well-trodden cobblestone pathway wends through the area on its way around a hillock covered in knee-high grasses whose entrance is blocked by a spear-topped black iron gate.  Saturated in crimson, orange, and yellow hues, the small courtyard is filled with a perpetually burning bonfire surrounded by dried-out ancient logs amid singed baskets of firewood.  Near the northeast, the faint outline of a dull green moss-covered stone arch supported by slanted buildings can be seen."
