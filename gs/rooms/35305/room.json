      "Carved with the Sunriders' emblem, a red cutlass before a golden sun, a high-backed wooden chair dominates one corner of the office.  Sand from the Sea of Fire encased in sand-filled jars lines the shelves, with labels denoting various tribal regions.  An iron-bound ledger rests on a sturdy desk, its cover embossed with the seal of Seareach.  Behind the desk, a clerk in canary yellow robes moves about the space handling patrons as well as other organizational tasks."
