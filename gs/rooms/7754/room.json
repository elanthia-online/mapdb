      "The passage widens out here to form a small cave.  Heavy gusts of wind flow from dozens of small openings in the south end of the cave. The holes in the cave have created a natural organ and a symphony of wailing notes fill the area.  Bits of glowing moss swirl on the wind creating a dazzling display of light and sound."
