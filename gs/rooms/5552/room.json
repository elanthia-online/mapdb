      "Lit only by what moonlight leaks between the boards covering the west-facing windows, the hallway seems dark and confining.  A continuous spiderweb of cracks riddles the plaster of the east wall and several large patches of plaster have fallen from the ceiling.  A pale doorframe carved with vines fills the south end of the corridor, and a maple door is set into the east wall.",
