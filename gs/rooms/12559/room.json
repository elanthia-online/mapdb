      "The canyon wall falls off into a steep cliff.  Several small houses perch precariously near the edge of the precipice, enjoying a view of the canyon and the river and misty mountains beyond.  Lizards skitter in the dry grass, climbing onto the pile of stones on the other side of the path to enjoy the sunlight."
