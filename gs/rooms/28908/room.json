    "description": [
      "Thick blue-green grass attempts to invade the painted cobblestones of the market, their tall blades swaying in the light seaborne breeze that carries with it the scent of dog roses and mulch.  Tanner's stalls and leatherworker's booths are evenly spaced from one another, each tilted at an angle to view the other.  Parked back against the towering cliff wall that stretches into the sky, a large wooden wagon painted black and silver has its door thrown wide open, while a chest-shaped calligraphed sign and a sturdy oak ladder are lashed to its side."
