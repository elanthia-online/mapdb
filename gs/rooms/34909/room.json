      "Poised beneath the steep ledge rising to the lusher garden above, the path winds upward through a cluster of gigantic shriveled mushrooms.  Boulder-sized gemstones of peridot, glimaerstone, and emerald lend a sparkle of color to the garden as the rays of moonlight filtering through the foliage play across their smooth surfaces."
