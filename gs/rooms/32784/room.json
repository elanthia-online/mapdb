      "Mist-hued cascades of luxuriant spidersilk drip from the walls and ceiling of the spacious shop, pooling around shelves of silvery wood holding scores of small, brightly colored bottles.  The shelves even line the broad bay windows flanking the shop entrance, displaying dozens of the crystal containers to passersby."
