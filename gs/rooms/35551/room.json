      "Bone-white sands spread across the cavern floor, the surface rippled by faint currents.  Overhead, a forest of bioluminescent tube anemones sways, each slender stalk ending in a pale, shimmering crown.  Walls of coral, veined with glittering threads of mica, encircle the space.  A mirror framed in driftwood and nacre hangs from a coral outcrop, its surface wavering in the water.  Nearby, a wide shell-shaped sign is wedged among barnacles, its flowing script illuminated by the anemones' glow."
