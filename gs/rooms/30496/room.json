      "Deep viridian walls contrast the pure white moldings in this airy bedroom, while the decor mimics the vibrant green in its fine detail.  A magnificent four-poster bed fitted with jade-hued sheets stands opposite an expansive watercolor painting.  The flanking teakwood nightstands each house a glass vase filled with freshly picked flowers.  Framing a tall open casement window are sheer, emerald-sheened drapes that flutter gently in the delicately scented tropical breeze."
