      "The muddy riverbank winds around a shallow pool that swirls slowly as the current feeds it.  Many seagulls and several muddy children forage in the shallow water.  Tattered fishing nets strung between wooden poles to dry festoon the area, set between run-down cottages and shacks built precariously on the muddy ground."
