      "Large and spacious, the room is bathed in soothing colors that range in hue from azure to dark blue.  Pale drapes of saffron silk frame the etched glass doors that lead to a balcony, while the eastern and western walls are lined with a trio of canopy beds in matching colors.  At the heart of the room is an oblong ebonwood table that is surrounded by six chairs."
