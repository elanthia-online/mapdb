      "Large panes of colored glass line the eastern wall framed with mithril.  Swirled hues of amber, verdant, and crimson stain the otherwise clear walls.  Piles of grime-covered mining clothes dot the room, making the air pungent with the scent of sweat and minerals.  Set centrally in the room is a mesh metal wire basket filled with raw stones.  Several have tumbled over the rim and lay scattered about the surrounding area."
