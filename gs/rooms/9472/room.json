      "Two heavily heavily barred windows set just above a small marble ledge are the only items of real interest in this barren yet elegant lobby.  The walls, ceiling and floor, though, speak of a wealth of silvers that have enriched the owners of the establishment.  Two dwarves mill about behind the windows, counting coins, writing notes, and conducting the customary bank business.  A gilded sign, affixed to the wall between the two windows, gives information on the use of the bank's services.",
