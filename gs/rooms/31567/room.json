    "description": [
      "Crescent-shaped cobblestone pavers form concentric bands around a cracked fountain, the contents of which spill across the ground, creating tiny rivulets that cascade down declining stone steps to the north.  Rising out of the broken fountain bowl is a verdigris copper jester statue that pirouettes within vaalin ribbons, the matching sculpted design echoed by those that wrap around the nearby stained glass gate.  Verdant rose vines create shadows upon a twining pathway at one corner of the courtyard, while a dull green moss-covered stone arch slips southeast into darkness."
