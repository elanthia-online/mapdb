      "Bales of hay line the edges of the pavilion, their sides bound by heavy wire and their bottoms resting upon a canvas floor covering.  Tufts of grass stick up between the heavy tent stakes that bind the walls to the ground, as well as create lumps beneath the canvas tarps, though in most places they are worn smooth from foot traffic.  A series of copper lanterns attached to the central support post provides illumination for the available wares."
