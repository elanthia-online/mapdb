      "The icy walls sparkle in the sunlight, glimmering with silvers and golds.  The light caresses the two ice statues standing, backs turned but looking over their shoulders, in the center of the room.  Both are female, but one is something less than humanoid in its form.  They stand on a base of ice, words carved into the surface.  The air is crisp and cold, smelling of melting glaciers and gently falling snow.",
