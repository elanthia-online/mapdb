      "Pale moonlight illuminates fluffy snowflakes that drift down slowly from the starry heavens and collect along snow banks that hug this secluded track in the mountains.  To the north, the trail ends at an ancient-looking arch at the base of a towering mountain wall.  A light blue portal stands at the other end of the path.  Despite the visible surroundings, the atmosphere is quite comfortable."
