      "Snow occludes most of the pier's planking, making the expanse of wood difficult to navigate.  Glimpses of the planks between drifts of snow suggest that there are cracks and treacherous gaps waiting beneath the white blanket.  One of the pilings to the east of the pier has collapsed into the water, finally having lost its battle with the waves.",
      "The easternmost of the trio of piers is a mess of creaky planks spotted heavily with the droppings of seafowl.  Waters to either side are deep, black, and cold.  Stinging salt is so thick on the air as to have left cakes of gleaming grit on the nearby pylons."
