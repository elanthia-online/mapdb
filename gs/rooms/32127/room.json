      "Clinging mist hangs low in the air, slowly shifting with any movement in the water beneath it.  A dilapidated rickety fishing dock bends sharply underfoot with each step across its remaining rust-stained wooden planks.  Tightly packed mangroves on the opposite side are overshadowed by massive petrified trees, their branches entangled against a dull grey, lifeless sky."
