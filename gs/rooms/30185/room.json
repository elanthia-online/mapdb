      "A felt-topped table and a quartet of comfortable chairs welcome the next players to a game of cards or dice in this roomy cabin filled with the scent of aged cigar smoke.  A scroll-framed mirror hangs behind a polished mahogany bar fixed with a brass foot rail, a row of matching stools lined up in front.  An old seafarers tune plinks out from a glass-topped music box on the end of the bar."
