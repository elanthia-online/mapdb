      "Discarded bandages, bloodstained splints, and other refuse litter the ground beside some stained wooden benches that serve as viewing stands for the action in an adjacent circular ring.  In pairs and small groups, challengers come and go as they wait for an opportunity to settle old scores or flex their muscles in friendly matchups within the ring.  Occasionally, moans, groans, and insensible mutterings can be heard as defeated competitors are dragged here to recover and restore their wounded pride."
