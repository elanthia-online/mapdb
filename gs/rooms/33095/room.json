      "Somewhat on the small side, this carrack looks to have once been a fine vessel, although now it is listing heavily to port.  Years of neglect and abuse have rendered this hulk of warped and broken boards ready for the salvage yard.  A crooked companionway leads further into the inky bowels of this floating ruin."
