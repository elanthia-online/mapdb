      "The cold is intense as the burrow's tunnel proceeds deeper into the earth, flanked by niches full of corpses new and old.  Air whistles through the tunnels in low moans, knife-sharp, but its chill keeps the odor of death to a low sickly sweetness.  Bootprints disturb the loamy earth, the patterns too distinct to have been there for long."
