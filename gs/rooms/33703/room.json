      "Atop a smooth marble floor rests a white claw-foot bath flanked on either side by a wash cloth basket and a small wood table to hold various sundries.  Behind the bath, a sea blue tile wall rises from floor to ceiling to accent the room's otherwise plain white walls.  In the corner, a pair of brass lanterns hanging next to a round glass washbowl provide a soft glow to the space, the oil releasing a sweet orange blossom aroma when it burns."
