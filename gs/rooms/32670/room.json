      "A low arch opens into a spacious cave hewn from the obsidian foundation of the tower above.  Gauzy, sanguine bolts of silk are draped from the cave's high ceiling, lending a ruddy hue to the dim light.  Mounted on the wall opposite the entry is a large scaled hide, secured in position by small mithril spikes.  Along another wall is a raised obsidian dais above which is a small niche.  A thick pile of furs of various sorts overlays the platform, and a plush snow cat fur rug covers a portion of the floor."
