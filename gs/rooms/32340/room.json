      "A sign with a blue crab on it hangs askew from one of the pilings, the paint having flaked away in places.  Its inspiration seems to be the bright blue crabs that skitter around on the rocks near to the shore.  They are evidently the only creatures hardy enough to thrive near the warmthless shores of the main.",
      "The thoroughfare of the main pier is wide and largely clear of debris.  Rotting barrels crowd to the sides of the dock, sprouting from heaps of netting, lines, and twine that have been similarly abandoned.  The cold has glazed all surfaces with a glistening coat of rime."
