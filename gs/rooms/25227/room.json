      "Sands laze shiftlessly beneath the shadow of a great tower of rock, stark and stern against the daylit sky.  Colorful variegations sweep across the rock spire's face from its base to its wider peak, lurid purples and flashfire reds swirling through the duller beige of the stone.  The inverted taper of the spire lends it the appearance of a great hammer that might come swinging down at any vindictive moment."
