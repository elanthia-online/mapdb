      "You curse instinctively as you hit your head on the low ceiling of the crypt chamber, and revile your ancestors under your breath for having been so short.  There is barely enough room to crawl through here, so you quickly glance from side to side to discover anything of interest.  Among the crushed bones and the rubble, you spy a very narrow chute."
