      "Windowless and dim, it's a wonder how the artisan gets any detailed work done.  A small leather-padded stool rests between two paint-stained tables, easily affording the craftsman an ample amount of space.  Short shelves and stands hold an assortment of half-finished miniatures, many still colorless or missing limbs.  Tart crumbs are scattered about the floor."
