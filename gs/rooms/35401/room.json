      "Ribbons drift from a raised platform at the courtyard's southernmost end, their movement slow and rhythmic in the night air.  Urns filled with blossoms encircle the dais, their faint fragrance mingling with the warmth of the nearby torches.  Shadows flicker across the cobalt blue tiles, their glossy surfaces reflecting the unsteady glow.  Beyond the colonnade's arches, vendor stalls rest in stillness, their vibrant awnings now dim silhouettes beneath the soft light of scattered flames."
