      "Swaying slightly in the gentle tug of a seashore breeze, a stand of thick-trunked jelly palms obscures the granite cliff face and is laden with bright orange fruits and feathery palm pinnate leaves.  Huddled in their shadows, a variety of thatch-roofed domiciles are built to either side of a boardwalk that cuts through the shaggy broom sedge and marram grass.  Bamboo-poled torches sprout up around the various pathways leading to the beach, their flame-filled bowls responding to the subtle currents of the seaside air."
