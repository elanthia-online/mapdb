      "Soft light filters down from glowing orbs overhead, bathing the interior of the wagon in afternoon tones.  A long wooden counter has been stacked high with various bins holding a variety of grapes and other ingredients.  An artistic gnomish wine press rests at the end of the counter, the strange apparatus gleaming in the ambient light.  A woven reed basket nearby holds some finished wines."
