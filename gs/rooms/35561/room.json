      "Polished shale spreads across the cavern floor, its dark surface veined with silver and pale green mica that glints in the filtered light.  At the chamber's heart rises a column of hollow coral, its surface carved by water and time into smooth terraces where glowing stones rest like captured stars.  A shallow niche in the eastern wall holds fine pieces of jewelry, their delicate forms nestled in mother-of-pearl inlay and illuminated by glimaerstones imbedded into the coral column."
