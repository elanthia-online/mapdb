    "description": [
      "An extensive row of tall sweetbrier hedges provides a delightful natural distraction from the thick briars that lie just on the other side of the encampment enclosure, the shrub's apple-like fragrance wafting faintly through the clearing.  A narrow water-filled trench wends its way through the area, delivering clear blue-green water to adjacent sections in the compound.  Concealed pathways fork off to the northwest and east, the latter direction following alongside the meandering reed-edged waterway."
