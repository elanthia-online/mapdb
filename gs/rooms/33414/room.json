      "Tidy bamboo scaffolding holds aloft matching pipes, carrying fresh water from the distant cliffs of Kraken's Fall down to the small sharing garden.  A white picket fence encircles the manicured grass of the plateau, which supports dozens of raised seagrass baskets and harvest box planters.  To the north, the waves of Tenebrous Cauldron crash against the shore, while southward the dunes create a verdant barrier between the cliffs and the mica-flecked beach."
