      "An acrid scent, not entirely natural, travels through the air in a biting undercurrent.  Tangled roots hang from the walls, while a few larger ones stretch across the ground, making the terrain difficult but not impassable.  Fog mostly conceals the obstacles, but here and there, a gnarled tangle breaches through the mist.  To the south, an opening in the roots offers access to a shop occupying a well-lit burrow.",
