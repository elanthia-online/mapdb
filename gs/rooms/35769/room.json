      "The low-ceilinged hold echoes with the drip of seawater.  Brine laps at crates fractured to reveal tarnished ingots, their edges rounded and pitted by years of abandonment.  A few scattered links from what was once a gold chain are trapped between the planks of the hold, forming a glinting and uneven trail to a corroded saber driven into the wood of the deck."
