    "description": [
      "A wide, open-ended sleeping niche has been carved out of the limestone cliff, providing an expansive view just below the canopy of trees, as the uppermost reaches begin to thin out.  More sunlight is present here, adding both warmth and light.  In addition to an oak bed with an over-stuffed mattress piled with a thick zaffre blue quilt and matching fat pillows, an oak side table and dresser set off to one side complete the furnishings.  Steel doors suspended on rails are etched with flitting dragonflies filled with bright enamel in jewel-tone hues."
