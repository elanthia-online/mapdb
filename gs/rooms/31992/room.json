      "A scatter of overturned tables and chairs covers the dead grass across the small rolling hill, the shattered plates and cutlery buried beneath mounds of upturned earth.  A blackened pyre stands behind a half-circle of homes, stacked high with cloth-covered shapes left to smolder between the layers of foliage."
