      "Crude lengths of wood have been cleaned and secured together, forming the supports of the off-sided structure.  Strips of rough leather are woven across the sides, creating various intricate patterns, while pieces of sailcloth are stretched and layered above, finishing the protective shelter of the lean-to.  Standing in the center of the space is a stick frame of interlaced vines which displays various weapons."
