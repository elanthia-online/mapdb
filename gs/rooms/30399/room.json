      "Crying out, several seagulls float on strong air currents, searching the water for sea life taking refuge at the jagged base of Charl's Teeth.  Peeking through the water, several smaller boulders are scattered.  Seaweed caught in the rocks floats outward along the surface, veiling the ocean floor."
