      "Gold-leafed dressers line the east and west walls and carry upon them rose-gold trays filled with morsels to snack upon.  Teardrop crystals dangle from stringed pearls that are draped across the walls, while a large round mirror is placed above the line of gemmed streamers.  A honey-colored teak ladder breaks up the space between rooms, opening to a loft above."
