      "Orbs covered in frost emit a soft glow that illuminates the recently shoved path connecting the manor house to the ellipse beyond.  Enclosed by a stone wall, the courtyard is highlighted in bright colors as light slips through nearby windows, which are all comprised of painted glass.  Camellia shrubs bloom with brilliant colors at the cardinal points of the courtyard, while helleborus sprout from the frozen ground between them in dusky shades of burgundy, cream, and varying virescent hues."
