      "Cell after cell flanks the wide corridor leading to the far end of the castle dungeons.  Other than the occasional splinter of hay on the stone ground, the walkway is clean, with no obvious source to the horrific odor of rot lingering in the cold air.  At the end of the hallway hang several pairs of shackles, the metal freshly polished."
