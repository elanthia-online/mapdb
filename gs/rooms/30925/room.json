    "description": [
      "A balcony is perched atop a projecting elbow of thick buttress roots, its railing fashioned of interwoven vines.  It overlooks the first tier of the jungle canopy, a seemingly never-ending ocean of trees stretching into the emerald distance.  Brightly colored birds are everywhere, their plumage and raucous songs providing a vibrant punctuation to the foliage.  From the ground below, the soft whisper of falling water interjects a peaceful undertone to the energetic serenade in the boughs."
