      "Torchlight flickers against the cobalt tiles, its warm glow shifting across the glossy surface in uneven ripples.  Anchored within rings along the pillars, the torches burn steadily, their golden light reflecting off the cascading water.  At the courtyard's center, a mountain-shaped fountain rises, its sculpted stone tiers shadowed beneath the firelit glow.  Copper statues of goats and sheep glisten beneath the flowing streams, their aged patinas casting faint greenish hues across the wet stone."
