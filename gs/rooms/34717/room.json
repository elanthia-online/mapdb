    "description": [
      "The earth of the garden is spongy and moist and littered with decaying leaves.  The faint sweetness of rot lingers on the still air, and thick billows of fog crawl along the ground between stands of weeping willow and cypress.  Dirge-vaon grows thick to either side of a trail running from the gate to a sallow green stone temple lit by torches spitting emerald flames.  The temple takes the form of a colossal serpent rearing up above the garden's canopy, its eyes alive with emerald flames."
