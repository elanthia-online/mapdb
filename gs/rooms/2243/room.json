    "description": [
      "Just around a sharp turn in the passageway, the glaes smooths into a polished face that is as clear as it is regular.  It reveals a view into the glaes, like looking through the window of a dwelling.  Inside flows a vein of molten lava, its progress a raging current of fury that sends heat radiating through the very rock itself.  The warmth emanates off the glaes wall in a daunting curtain."
