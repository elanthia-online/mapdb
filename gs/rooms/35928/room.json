      "Bronze gauze fabric continues in shallow scallops along the fence alongside the path, and clusters of long-stemmed wisp lanterns grow at the base of each post, causing the decoration to wink and glitter beneath the glow.  The scent of damp lingers in the air, little more than a specter beneath the aroma of fragrant hardwoods."
