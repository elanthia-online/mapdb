      "Piles of unwashed robes and soiled linens crowd around a chipped granite sarcophagus.  Mildewed tapestries, hung at irregular angles and emanating a musky stench, muffle the sound of dripping water.  Worn into the stone floors is an uneven path, made from footprints in various shapes and sizes, that terminates behind a tattered azure curtain embroidered with a faded dolphin."
