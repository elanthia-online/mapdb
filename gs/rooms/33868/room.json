    "description": [
      "The variegated cobblestone roads converge together, the borders framed by a number of narrow wagons filled with rope-bound crates.  At the center of the crossroads stands a handblown glass nielira resting upon a fountain of sun-bleached limestone, its fragile blue-green tentacles gently dipping into the surrounding waters.  Several verdant-leafed plants float across the fountain basin, the vivid flowers caught in various stages of growth, their roots shifting between flashes of gilded scales."
