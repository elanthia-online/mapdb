      "Sounds of laughter and the scent of grilled seafood wafts in from the north, intermingling with the fragrance of leafy naefira, the flora encircling a vase-carved fountain of onyx marble.  Branded casks of mahogany line the southeastern walkway, providing a perch for a duo of cormorants preening between the ropes.  Nestled between the crates are displays of wood-slatted signal fans, spyglasses, and map tubes, the well-maintained nautical tools kept beneath lock and key."
