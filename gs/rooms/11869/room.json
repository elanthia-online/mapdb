      "A chill pervades the tunnel, rising damply from the slowly moving stream underfoot.  The dimly lit walls run slick with moisture, and the water's emerald glow is reflected much more deeply in the darkened surface of the wet granite.  The air hangs heavily, unmoving, and each breath draws in a lungful of the cold, humid air.  Three directions present potential exits, each with the same amount of sinister darkness.  The stream has made its choice, though, and it flows to the south."
