      "A gold and crimson wyvern tapestry hangs on one of the blue watered silk walls, and a high arched ceiling rises overhead.  A worn rug sits in one corner of a dark mahogany floor.  There is a iron-bound ebonwood chest on one side of the shop and a gold-veined black marble counter on the other."
