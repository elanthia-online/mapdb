      "Open to the air of the immense cavern on its northwestern side, the corridor has a low ceiling that is supported by pillars roughly hewn out of the surrounding stone.  Spindly crystals in strange colors sprout from the pillars in geometric configurations.  Though unevenly spaced and crudely worked, the gems pulse in time with fretful bursts of yellowish light, the pattern too regular to be the work of mere nature."
