      "[The Brass Ring, Storage]"
    ],
    "description": [
      "A small herd of carved wooden horses in various states of disrepair are crowded into a makeshift corral taking up most of the available storage space above the carousel.  Leather reins and tarnished bits hang on oak-paneled walls on both sides of a cedar cabinet filled with evenly spaced shelves.  Suspended from the low ceiling by lengths of faded velvet, myriad brass rings, each polished to a mirror shine, reflect the flickering light cast from a pair of lanterns mounted near the stairway."
