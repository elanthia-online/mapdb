      "Folded back to emit the twilight-hued light of the sky beyond, grey shutters are swung away from wide windows and anchored to walls on all four sides of the well-kept room.  Resting upon a tangerine and slate grey braided rug at the center of the room is a broad oak desk.  A cushioned high-back chair rests behind it, while a smoky lantern sits in one corner."
