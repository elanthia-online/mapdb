      "A quartet of thatch-roofed dwellings litter the small blackened hillside, the cobbled pathway traced by a dry streambed, the shallow sands exposing the gnarled roots of a nearby witchwood tree.  Sickly grey vines snake across the banks of the stream, splaying across the grasses like thin veins of ash."
