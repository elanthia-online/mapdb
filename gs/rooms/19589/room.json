      "Colorful skeins of silk arch across the cobblestone pathway as it makes its way towards a bridge at one end and the Great Hall at the other.  Tiny sea glass charms are woven into the edges of the fabric and reflect golden sunlight upon the wisteria that has become tangled into their lengths.  A light, tugging breeze disturbs the glaesine orbs that dangle from above, causing them to click quietly together.",

Tiny sea glass charms are woven into the edges of the fabric and reflect silvery moonlight upon the wisteria that has become tangled into their lengths.  Glaesine orbs house hundreds of tiny sparkling lights to create a playful and bright illumination for the area."
