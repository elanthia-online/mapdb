      "Brass torches sit in large rings upon the walls of the linden-paneled bar, their crystalline flames flickering with an inner light that fills the space.  A long bar topped with a tray full of hot drinks separates diners from the workspace where a lanky bartender bustles about.  Flanked by a cool drink caddy and a wine rack, a long liquor cabinet stretches across the wall behind the bar, while several copper-bound oak kegs with easily accessible taps rest beneath."
