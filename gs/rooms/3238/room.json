      "The snow is deep along this part of the path making it difficult to travel very quickly.  Directly in front of you are several large foothills that stretch out to the west and continue on to the north.  A narrow path is cut from the snow and leads along one of the valleys between the two foremost hills.  It appears to be unused but with the snow and ice around you it would be hard to tell if anything had been by here recently."
