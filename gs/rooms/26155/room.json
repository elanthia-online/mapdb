      "Exposed rafters and wrought iron fixtures are all that remain of the corridors ceiling.  Dust and debris are pushed about by strong winds that crash down upon the rug-covered floor as they crest the high granite walls.  An ornate table leg is lodged under a towering pile of mortar and broken stone, its curves illuminated by the dim light that trickles in from the north."
