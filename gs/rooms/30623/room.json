      "Spacious and well lit, this kitchen is full of supplies and wonderful aromas.  A marble-topped driftwood counter is centered in the room with plates of food ready for any event.  Standing tall, a rhimar-lined porcelain chest dominates most of the back wall, while a polished oak table is tucked next to the entrance.  Hanging above is a brightly painted sign.  Bits of kindling and wood are stacked next to a large cast iron stove with its clean grate open and ready for cooking."
