      "Several paths converge in front of a wide, tall, well-constructed barn.  A dark grey in the moonlight, the barn appears to be fairly new, with its cedar boards running straight and true.  The boards are tightly nailed to the framework, and show very little gap anywhere between them.  Bits of chaff, wheat, and barley litter the ground, fodder for the birds that keep a safe distance from you.  The wide barn door stands ajar, creaking slightly as it waves in the warm wind.",
