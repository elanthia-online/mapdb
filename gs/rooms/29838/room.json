      "Stacks of unopened crates, boxes, and barrels line the walls of the massive hold.  Tucked away in a corner is a small wooden table.  Several large iron stands are placed down the center showing off their wares.  Narrow beams of light, shifting through a grate above, shed fractured illumination over the area."
