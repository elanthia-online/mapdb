      "A few small shops front Honeybeer Road, selling odds and ends.  One shop has a windowbox filled with colorful pinwheels that spin wildly whenever the wind blows, flashing their bright colors in a dizzying dance.  Another storefront's window is filled with a display of beer steins.  A carved spruce sign shaped like an arrow points toward the doorway of the local fletcher's shop.",
