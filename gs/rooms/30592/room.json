    "description": [
      "The interior of this large stable is warmed by several cast iron stoves strategically placed near the doors as well as just beside the spacious stalls.  Brushes, assorted contraptions, horseshoes, whips, and cleaning supplies adorn the walls.  The honeyed scent of fresh grain rises from wooden buckets, and the sound of rushing water comes from a trough connected to an unseen source of water through one wall.  A Malghavan family keeps busy around you, tending to the animals."
