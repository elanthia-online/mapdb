      "Deep shadows grip the area in perpetual night, not even a pinpoint of light winking through the velvety shroud of darkness that shifts restlessly overhead.  An ancient glowbark tree towers over the surroundings -- an ethereal radiance rhythmically pulsing outward from the deep furrows in its bark.  Sirenflowers grow along the edges of the streams trickling beneath the massive roots of the tree, sending forth eerie cries that flow into one another to form a slow, sad melody that hangs over the area like a fog."
