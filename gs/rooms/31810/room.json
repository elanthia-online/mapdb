      "Monstrous, deformed trees grow out of the grey-green river, their twisted limbs acting as route markers pointing in the directions of the diverging currents.  A fallen bough floats on the surface of the deep water beneath the vine-draped branches.  To the southeast, a small waterfall carries a handful of skeletal leaves on a sluggish current towards a heavily wooded terrain."
