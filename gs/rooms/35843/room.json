      "Glistening webwork spans the ceiling in intricate layers, each strand spun from metallic threads that gleam in hues of copper, gold, silver, and platinum.  Suspended from long posts along the northern and southern walls, enormous spools feed the woven canopy above.  Dewy light from embedded moonstones clings to the threads in soft glimmers.  Beneath the shimmering web, long tables form a central showroom where wares are displayed in neat rows."
