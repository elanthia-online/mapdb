      "Encased in polished oak walls, the tidy office is fitted with a limestone floor that has alabaster striations mixed with slate blue veins.  Several rugs in matching hues compliment the floor, as do the Vornavian silk drapes framing the large picture windows that face the street.  Numerous oak benches line the walls, while cushioned chairs surround a desk set in the middle of the room.  Beyond the desk, a well-lit corridor leads further into the building, and is lined with books and bulletins boards."
