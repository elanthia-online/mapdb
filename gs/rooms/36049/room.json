      "A trio of domiciles borders the southeastern edge of the branching pathway, the rolling grasslands stretching behind them in broad waves.  Opposite a rugged sky blue ger, the route that angles northwest is marked by colorful pennants that turn and flutter in the light breeze.  Tall stalks of allium rise between the gers, their spherical violet blooms standing bright against the shifting yellow-green of the surrounding grass."
