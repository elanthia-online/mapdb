      "[Singing Crags, Giant Cacao]"
    ],
    "description": [
      "A singularly gigantic cacao tree looms over the crags.  Though far taller and broader than one ought to grow, the bright yellow and orange pods cradled near its trunk are unmistakable.  Drooping white flowers erupt in protrusion from its outer branches, which spread wide as if to embrace the moist air.  Frayed ropes and broken planks suggest that a hut once occupied the branches, but was betrayed by an expanse of weak and spongy wood along the trunk that has been undermined by a livid scarlet fungus."
