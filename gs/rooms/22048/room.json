    "description": [
      "This elegant little sitting room is filled with fragrance and color from the fresh flowers arranged in crystal vases placed throughout the area.  Botanical paintings in gilt frames hang on the rosewood-paneled walls, while a soft floral rug cushions every step.  Two ivory damask settees with polished rosewood frames flank a low tea table, inviting relaxing conversation over drinks.  In the corner, a deep green raw silk cushion offers a comfortable resting spot."
