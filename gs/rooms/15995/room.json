      "Moonlight filters through the iridescent panes of six stained-glass windows spaced evenly along the cylindrical walls of this commodious hall.  Rows of low wooden benches flank a sturdy podium mounted upon a solid marble dais, facing a mosaic-tiled section of floor that portrays a gallant knight in full battle regalia.  Carved wooden lions grasp black and red crosshatched banners overhead, while flickering torches in wall-sconces drive back the shadows from a trio of archways leading to other areas of the castle.",

Rows of low wooden benches flank a sturdy podium mounted upon a solid marble dais, facing a mosaic-tiled section of floor that portrays a gallant knight in full battle regalia.  Carved wooden lions grasp black and red crosshatched banners between unlit torches vigilantly waiting in their sconces over a trio of archways leading to other areas of the castle."
