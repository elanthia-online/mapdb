      "A tumble of boulders obstructs nearly half of the broad tunnel, turning it wasp-waisted at an already sharp bend.  The slope of the floor is scattered with rocky debris.  Water hisses forth in a fine mist through crevices along a stretch of wall and dribbles darkly down the stone to puddle murkily below.  From the northeast, a sloshing rumble can be heard echoing through the passage."
