      "The shallows near the rocky islet are a graveyard of ship wreckage, which lies half-submerged beneath the insistent waves.  Jagged splinters of wood and anchors that are more rust than iron poke up from the silty bottom, protruding from tangles of thick seaweed.  Fish thrive in the ships' remains, smaller ones with scales of silver, copper, and gold lurking in the shadows while their larger predators swim stridently through the clear waters."
