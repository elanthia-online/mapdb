      "Banks of wild rose framing the court have gone neglected long enough for them to overgrow their beds.  Their petals are a crimson flood on the dark cobblestones.  Beyond the boundaries of the courtyard, down long paths that wind beneath thornwood trees, are spacious homes of shadowy stone.  They look abandoned and their yards have fallen into ruin and overgrowth."
