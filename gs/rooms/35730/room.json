      "A badly listing cog has been hurled against the stony islet by the fury of the waves, its taffrail reduced to splintered timbers that allow access to the main deck.  Monk seals have claimed the shadows of the hulk as their own, and their sleek forms sprawl lazily in the shadows.  Broken shells and fragments of coral litter the rock, washed up by aggressive tides.  Not far off the rocky expanse, the silhouette of a mast breaches through the lightless waters, hinting at another shipwreck below the waves."
