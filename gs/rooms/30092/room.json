      "All but one of the oil lamps in this section of the pavilion are concentrated along one wall, fully illuminating an open-faced wooden cabinet and a set of round pegs, beneath which sits a small round table with a discreet vellum note card posted amongst its wares.  The other lamp hangs directly above a heavy grey suede curtain that leads deeper into the shop."
