      "Tall, thick walls of orange-hued stucco surround a courtyard paved with grey riverstone slabs.  The hot, humid night air carries the fecund smell of a nearby salt creek.  In the center of the courtyard is a statue carved in milky-colored granite.  A studded iron portcullis guards the entrance to the hoosegow rotunda.  A keyhole arch leads out.",
