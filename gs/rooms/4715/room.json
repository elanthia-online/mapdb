      "The road leads straight and true through the forest to the northeast and southwest.  Occasional breaks in the overhanging foliage allow glimpses of the blue sky and shining sun, but for the most part the road is bathed in shadows.  Although the road is in good shape, the odd protruding stone here and there causes one to travel with care, lest a closer examination of the roadway occur suddenly and painfully.",
