    "description": [
      "Silk the color of new leaves stretches into a tall central spire, supported by curved wooden ribs shaped like hollyhock stalks.  A wrought faenor arbor twined in shimmering vinework defines the entry, its silver blooms echoing those painted faintly across the pale floor tiles.  Light filters through petal-shaped panes overhead, scattering soft hues across a circle of low display pedestals.  To the east, a breeze stirs from the open edge of the cliffside court."
