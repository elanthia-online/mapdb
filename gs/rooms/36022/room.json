      "Low-roofed but wide, a cobalt blue felt-sided ger crouches between the hillocks, its oblong shape giving it a slightly unusual presence beside the north-south track.  Wild tufts of sheepgrass cluster around its base, and bright white pebbles ring the footing before converging into a narrow path that meets the main route.  Wide boulders flank the entry, each one topped with neatly fitted sheepskins."
