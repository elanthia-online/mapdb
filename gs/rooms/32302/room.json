    "description": [
      "The roadway splits around a vast granite boulder, the full size of which is concealed by a white blanket of fresh-fallen snow.  As it descends toward the northwest, the path is flanked by hardy scrub that gives way to stony banks.  The main road veers sharply southwest, the hardpack permanently marred by the crisscross of wagon wheels and the even punctuation of mule prints."
