      "Lightly stained and heavily lacquered, an enormous tree stump surrounded by high-backed ebonwood chairs dominates the center of this gathering area.  Hand-painted and framed in solid gold, an elaborate map of Elanith rests above a large fireplace of pristine white granite blocks, and a dart board hangs on the wall off to the side.  Across from a well-used bar, a wide mantle serves as a prominent display for more than a dozen small crystal figurines, each carved into a different house crest."
