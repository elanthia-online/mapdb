      "Thick vines of white and purple grapes wind their way through a wooden arbor, their knotted limbs form a tight weave that is laden with broad leaves.  Sheltered within the arbor, and protected from both the weather and the heat of the day, is a small open-air shop.  Long counters topped with green and purple oilcloth line the back of the shop, while the front is dotted with small baskets."
