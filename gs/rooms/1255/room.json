      "A massive dye-stained stone counter dominates the muddy rock-walled chamber, overseen by a disgruntled-looking dwarven clerk who glares and mutters to himself at each customer's approach.  Behind the counter, a dwarf-sized tunnel leads into some mysterious back room from which sounds of splashing and cursing and grumbling can be heard."
