      "Cultivated cypress trees line the gold-veined marble pathway that stretches from a pillar-sided gazebo towards a towering spire fashioned of smooth travertine.  Red, blue, green, and black reflect off the walls of the distant structure, which is pearly white against the dark of the night sky.  The distant sound of wind slipping through trees permeates the area."
