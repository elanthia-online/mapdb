      "Stacked wooden crates line the perimeter of the cobblestones, the narrow chests filled with fresh produce carefully encircled by panels of rhimar.  A collection of colorful wicker baskets sit beside small silk-canopied carts, each carriage decorated with garlands of heartleaf draped over the cushioned seats.  Centered between the containers is a tall gilt-inlaid stand, its surface covered in a variety of parchment and twine-hung tags labeled with various places of commerce."
