      "Sheltered by a dense canopy of verdant umbrage, an elevated wooden platform affords an expansive view of the surrounding landscape, the western edge guarded by moss-covered trees resembling green giants with wrinkled bark faces.  A polished heartwood slab table flanked by a series of high-backed chairs is arranged atop floor mats woven from dried grasses, giving off a sweet aroma.  A seemingly floating staircase leads to a vine-enclosed platform farther above."
