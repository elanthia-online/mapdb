      "Rooftops appear behind high green reeds scattered along the gently sloping riverfront, the muddy strand trampled with myriad footprints.  Luminous white pebbles litter the shoreline creating a rough path away from the water's edge, through the reeds and disappearing over a grassy bank.  An assortment of abandoned luggage is piled high in a small white boat run aground on the eastern riverbank."
