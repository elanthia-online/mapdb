    "description": [
      "Fist-sized round stones and large boulders dot the tundra, their wind-swept faces darkened by rust-hued kidney lichen and mist green reindeer moss.  Twisted and gnarled, the ropey trunk of a large juniper rises out of the mottled ground to spread its verdant limbs across the area, the bough clusters resembling clouds that cast similar shadows.  A smooth stone bench rests beneath the ancient tree, the granite it is carved from nearly a perfect match in shade to the berries above it."
