      "Deeply cushioned cobalt-hued couches draped with lush snowcat pelts flank a tidy desk topped with petrified modwir.  A baystone-punctuated chandelier candelabra hangs directly above the workspace.  Densely planted vegetation in a variety of colorful pots draw attention toward a trio of arched windows set into the darkly paneled walls.  Several colorful cloaks hang on hooks beside the entry."
