      "Palm trees ring a small court, dividing the houses with their luxurious fronds.  The homes are spaced more generously, some boasting attractive awnings and small patio gardens.  Residents hurry past occasionally, their arms laden with wrapped parcels, large bunches of fresh flowers and baskets full with freshly baked bread."
