      "Canvas pools in loose folds amid yellowing grass along the edges of the small tent, which is supported by a single rough oak post.  Several small pine barrels are arranged in a neat row that stretches to the north, while several dusty wicker baskets are scattered about the dirt floor in seemingly random order.  A lantern rests upon a low round table in the center of the space, its bright white light providing ample illumination."
