      "Built from indigenous trees, a makeshift shelter is barely enough to keep the elements from soaking the ground and everything underneath.  Thick branches, greenery, a bit of mud, and some sizeable sheets of oilcloth have all been applied to the outside to aid with weatherproofing, though heavy winds manage to keep the refuge in a state of constant repair.  Tucked neatly beneath the wood frame, with space leftover for a few travelers, a hollowed-out tree stump and a smooth cottonwood bench offer a few basic amenities."
