      "Nearly as tall as a man, old stone carvings meant to resemble shark teeth frame the road to either side.  A tailor's shop stands away from the statuary, separated from them by a lawn of reddish green grass.  Fine textiles in a wide assortment of colors and styles are displayed within, while a spruce wood sign over the entrance is carved with a needle and thread."
