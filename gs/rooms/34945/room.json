      "The boardwalk here carries over the ocean, with driftwood pillars plunging into the azure waters below.  The linens that form the canopy are tied back against the beams supporting them, allowing the sun to shine through.  These same beams also have metal hooks attached, where smaller ships can be tied up alongside the boardwalk.  Woven mats form a semicircle at one end of the boardwalk surrounding a stone pool lined with lanterns, offering space for merchants to peddle their wares."
