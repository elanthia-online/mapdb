      "Iridescent spheres of glass are scattered across the ceiling of the shop, the pastel-washed orbs filled with a myriad of unfurling flowers crafted from brightly colored silk.  Affixed to each brocaded wall is a rectangular wicker basket, each ribbon-woven container lined in blue-checked gingham.  Set at each corner of the room is a verdant capybara topiary, the rotund forms clad in loosely sewn costumes of butterflies and moths, their gossamer wings draped across their shoulders."
