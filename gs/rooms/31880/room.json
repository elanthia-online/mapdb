      "Thick, rope-like vines climb the walls of the cabin, obscuring them from view.  Large crystal vases full of flowers are gripped tight by the vegetation, covering the greenery with their colorful blossoms.  Dark green, leafy creepers cover the floor, almost engulfing a worn ivory carpet.  Pale beams of moonlight trickle through the verdant tangle growing over several opaque skylights.",
