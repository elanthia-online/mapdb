      "Tall bushes perpetually reign in a noble, hushed twilight of their own shading.  Lovers and friends stroll here often, and you are reminded of those who have departed the lands but were much cared for.  The outer wall is breached with a superbly-tooled iron gate, surmounted by a miniature dragon wrought in extraordinary detail.  Set midpath between the outer wall and Aspis itself is a small shrine containing two figures.  A small ora plaque is visible to the right of the entryway."
