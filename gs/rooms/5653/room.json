      "Two crude wooden spears have been crossed at the tips and form an odd portal that guards the northeastern passageway.  Hanging directly above the weapons is a yellowed skull of unknown origin.  It has been affixed to a rusting chain and placed so that the eye sockets are staring directly outward."
