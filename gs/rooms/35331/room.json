      "Starlight filters through the dense canopies of apricot and carob trees, casting faint, dappled patterns across the cobbled lane.  A bright yellow stucco building on one side glimmers softly, its vibrant hue muted to a pale glow in the dim light.  Opposite, the tangled flora appears as a dark, shifting silhouette, its blooms barely visible but perfumed with a faint, sweet fragrance.  The air is cool and quiet, carrying the distant murmur of waves and the occasional rustle of leaves."
