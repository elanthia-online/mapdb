      "The air hangs thick with the smell of booze and sweat and mingles with the dull roar of rowdy patrons.  A long black oak bar stretches one wall that is covered in colorful glass bottles below a large emerald-studded serpent and the railing of a loft.  Several stained tables and chairs are clustered about the room before a low stage, while others appear to have been pulled into the darker corners for dicing or privacy.  Behind the bar, a small pair of swinging doors leads to the kitchen."
