    "description": [
      "A narrow bridge of crumbling rock joins the southern half portion of the crescent with the north.  Battered by subterranean air currents, the unforgiving span look out over a plummet onto asperous crags along the perimeter of the alien monuments occupying the cavern's lowest reaches.  The pathway is bathed in ethereal light from crystals budding from the porous tufa of the rocky walls above."
