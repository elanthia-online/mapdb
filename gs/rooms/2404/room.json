      "The narrow rowhouses along Barley Lane are taller than most of the surrounding homes.  The eaves of the buildings are low and broad to shade their porches from the sun and keep walkways free of snow.  Lamp posts to either side of the road have bases etched with sheaves of barley.",
      "The narrow buildings on Barley Lane appear taller than others in the Trace, possibly due to the lowering of the street level.  The eaves of the buildings are low and broad, shading their porches from the southern sun in summer, and keeping the walkways snow-free in winter."
