      "The shadows of the square-cut niches are nearly impenetrable, their oppressive darkness concealing all but the faintest hints of the remains within.  One skull has its fleshless features turned toward the aisle.  Scratch marks around one of its eyes indicate that a creature has made a nest within.  Cut into the stone of the floor, steps proceed northward, rising in a slow climb toward a raised dais at the center of the crypt."
