      "Twin rows of fur-layered benches sit upon the mingled teak and white oak decking, the oars bracketed to their backings standing silent sentinels over their vacant seats.  Wreaths of fragrant fir dot the low wall of the railings, while a series of painted round shields are displayed upon its facing.  The creak and rattle of pullies fed with rope trickle through the area."
