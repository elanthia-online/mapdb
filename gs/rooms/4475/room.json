      "This immaculate yellow kitchen bears the mark of fanatic housekeeping.  A huge coal stove, standing before the painted rock walls, emits a scorching heat, despite the chimney that rises from the firebox and vanishes into the granite ceiling overhead.  Something is simmering on the stove in a tightly covered pot.  A box of footwear has been placed near the bleached pine table."
