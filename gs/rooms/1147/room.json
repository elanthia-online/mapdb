      "[Locksmehr River Trail]"
    ],
    "description": [
      "A second, somewhat smaller river surges from the northeast into the Locksmehr River.  The second river doesn't have nearly the volume of the Locksmehr, but the convergence produces a series of small rapids as the two flows collide.  The two rivers have created a large, long sandbar between them, and quite a bit of debris gathers there.  Several ravens pick through the debris, perhaps hoping to find something to eat or something shiny to collect."
