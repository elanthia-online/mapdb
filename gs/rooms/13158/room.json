      "Finely woven tapestries hang upon the mottled purple and green slate walls, documenting the many battles against the Grimswarm.  A glaes-shelved steel bookcase holds an array of texts to one side, while a padlocked, steel-braced footlocker occupies the other.  The office is spacious enough to house twin leather-covered barrel chairs in the corner, a few strides away from a pair of carved double doors.  Mounted above a polished marble-topped desk is the preserved head of one very large and ugly troll on a burnished bronze plaque."
