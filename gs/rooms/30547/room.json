      "Rich mahogany paneling encloses the room, polished to a deep ruddy luster.  A detailed circle of runes dominates the center of the floor, worked in pearlescent white tile amongst the greater pattern of muted geometric shapes.  Tightly rolled sheaves of paper peek out from small niches in the numerous scroll racks that line the walls."
