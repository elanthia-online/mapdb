    "description": [
      "A stand of massive trumpet trees flourishes, immensely tall and old, sheltered by the embrace of a towering ridge line that shades the area along its perimeter to the south and west.  Flowers, from canary yellow to flamingo pink in color, bloom brazenly amid the foliage, making the colossal trees look like puffs of vibrantly dyed cotton puffs.  A few boards are haphazardly nailed into the trunk of one tree to serve as handholds, and droplets of dried golden sap trail down the bole from the punctures."
