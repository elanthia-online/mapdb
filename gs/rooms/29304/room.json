      "A large, wood-fired kiln is set against the far wall in the back of this tiny space.  Tucked into one corner is a stone potter's wheel, splattered with paint and flecks of dried clay.  A broad driftwood shelf, affixed to one wall, displays the small, painted sculptures of life-like clay creatures.  A paint-smudged notice is tacked to one wall, beside a neatly lettered parchment list."
