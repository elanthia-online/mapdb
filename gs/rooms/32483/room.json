      "Opulent chandeliers adorned with firedrops and duskjewels hang high overhead, casting sharp-edged shards of colored light on the lush velvet runners of the throne room.  They climb several sets of decorative steps toward a gilded throne that sits beneath a livid scarlet banner stitched with a briar sprig before a charcoal grey moon.  Smaller seats that are no less opulent sit in a crescent, with the elevated throne situated at the zenith.  Crossed swords on the wall gleam with fresh polish."
