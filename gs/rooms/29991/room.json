      "Stone effigies crudely fashioned into the shapes of hulking warriors line the portion of the lightless path.  In the oppressive gloom, their muddled features take on ghastly planes and hideous twists.  One statue among them stands apart.  Forged from golvern dulled by disrepair, it depicts a strong-looking winged woman shrouded by folded wings."
