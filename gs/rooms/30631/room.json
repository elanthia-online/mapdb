      "Panes of clear crystal are set into brass framework to create this small light chamber.  Centered in the room is a hollowed-out stone filled with fish oil.  A ring of copper lanterns hangs from the top of the chamber centered above the depression with individual wicks leading from the light source down into the liquid below.  Looking out through the glass on one side is a perfect view of the town, while on the other a beautiful glimpse of the vast ocean."
