      "Pathways of crushed sea shells converge towards the alabaster-carved longboat raised within the center of the area, covered in dozens of muted sapphire candles flickering amongst dried white sea roses.  Natural driftwood benches sit beneath sunbleached linen canopies, the embroidered bolts of fabric tightly knotted to the silver-banded posts placed outside the circle.  Veiled in a layer of pale sand, small mementos and lush bouquets lean against the sandstone slab elevating the vessel."
