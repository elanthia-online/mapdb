      "Although nature has crept its way past the foundations, which are still somewhat intact, the construction of the barn was clearly never finished.  Even in an unfinished state, however, it appears to have served some function, given the trio of double-stacked racks on the wall holding the warped and rotting remains of pieces of tackle.  A handful of sacks overflowing with scrubbing brushes, sponges, and powder-filled jars hangs from the bottom rack."
