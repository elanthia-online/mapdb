      "Multiple burlap bags, some of them displaying the tops of dried ears of corn, line the walls of this tiny storage space.  While the area is still cramped, it seems to have escaped much of the destruction of the rest of the stall.  A scarred work table, its surface covered in random assortments of tools, sits in one corner, while a rickety stool has been pushed in front of it."
