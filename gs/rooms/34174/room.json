      "A burrow delving into the northern wall of the passage has caved in, littering the ground with grit and chunks of fallen stone.  A chitinous foreleg breaches out of the rubble, but it is unmoving and time has dulled its sheen.  Faint flutters of amber light beckon in an even pattern around a bend to the southeast.  The black granite of the walls vibrates faintly in time with the cresting and ebbing radiance, which seems out of place in the darkness."
