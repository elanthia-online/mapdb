      "A vaulted black ceiling covered with tiny pinpoints of light gives a celestial aura to this room.  Vines crawl over the walls and plants are nestled close to one another throughout, while a tiny fountain formed of Terasian stones rests in one corner, its waterfall providing a musical cascade of sound.  Directly opposite the fountain is an instrument rack, music stands, and a small grouping of chairs.  A hammock rests in a shadowed corner, allowing an undisturbed view of the sky above."
