      "Beeswax candles, their flames burning with a pale blue light, are scattered over every flat surface in this small shrine.  A flat stone altar takes up the entire back wall with several totems and idols placed reverently atop it, while a squat cedar box pyrographed with tribal markings is shoved into a far corner.  Small animal bones, feathers, and talons litter the floor and the air smells faintly musty."
