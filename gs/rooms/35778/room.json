      "Curving gently around the side of a turquoise villa, a cobblestone walkway disappears behind the building.  Clusters of hibiscus and bougainvillea bloom along the edges, their striking colors spilling over low hedges.  A papaya tree rises above a sturdy knotty pine staircase leading up to an elevated cottage, its tall trunk laden with ripe fruit.  Ferns and broad-leafed palms line a crushed seashell path as it weaves through the tropical foliage."
