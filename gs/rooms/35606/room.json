      "Marine blue bunting flutters overhead.  Though the banners' intricate lace borders may once have resembled seafoam, they are yellowed with age and ragged from decay.  The tabletop is etched with a spiral of scallop shells, each groove catching the glow of brass lanterns hanging above.  Napkins of sailcloth cleverly folded into the shapes of fish sit at each setting along the table's surface."
