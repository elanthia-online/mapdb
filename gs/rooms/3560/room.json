      "Dozens of exuberantly dressed beds of all sizes are set on platforms of various heights, effectively breaking the monotony of a straight-line type display.  Luxurious linens and pillows, all obviously elven-crafted, have been utilized as elegant complements to the furnishings.  Occasionally, from somewhere in the backroom, sounds of hushed conversation drift into the ever so quiet main room of the shop, your only indication that the shopkeeper is not alone."
