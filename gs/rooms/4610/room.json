      "The walls of this shop are covered with keys and locks of all colors, shapes, and sizes, from large iron padlocks to bone-white skeleton keys.  A white-hot coal fire burns steadily under a pot of molten metal over which stoops the locksmith's apprentice.  Forms for keys and lock parts sit wedged in sand on a wood work table nearby.  To the north, a dimly lit doorway recedes into the shadows."
