      "Plush padded velvet chairs and a thick luxurious carpet are but a few of the expensive alterations made to this shipboard casino. Even when gambling, nothing less than the ultimate in comfort for the customers is acceptable.  All of the crew are dressed in elegant silk attire, the women in long gowns and the men in fitted doublets and breeches.  Based on their wide smiles, they all seem to greatly enjoy their jobs as dealers or servers."
