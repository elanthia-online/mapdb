      "Beneath the towering cliffs, the grotto glows with kaleidoscope-like hues as jute-knotted glass fishing orbs light up the water.  Their soft, shifting colors ripple across the waves, casting the surrounding statues in ethereal shades of blue, green, and amber.  The carved wing of the Spine of Koar gleams faintly in the moonlight high above, lending an ethereal beauty to the shadowed cliffs and shimmering waters."
