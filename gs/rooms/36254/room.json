      "Blackened by paint and scorched by fire, the ship still retains its original dark hue even after its demise.  Ripped asunder, the ship's deck is split in half, the aft twisted and pointed towards the sky.  A broken ship's wheel lies on the ruined deck and reads, \"Wyrom's Wyrmship.\"  A rope has been bolted into a wooden plank which overlooks a small crimson schooner."
