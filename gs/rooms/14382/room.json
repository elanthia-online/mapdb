      "Apple trees ring the perimeter of this small garden, their boughs filled with singing birds and laden with fruit.  Bushes of boxwood have been pruned uniformly and sit squarely between each trunk.  Dark, loamy cultivated beds filled with the showy blossoms of tuberose, bergamot, gardenia and jasmine create an almost overwhelming perfume.  A white marble statue in the center of this retreat serves as a focal point for meditation.",
