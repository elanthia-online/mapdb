      "Tiny footprints are clearly visible along the mud track.  Judging from the distinct dragging marks that are located behind each set of the footprints it appears that whoever created them also wears a long cloak or perhaps a robe.  The perfectly shaped footprints lead directly toward the creek, where they suddenly disappear.  The melodic sound of a woman singing in a high soprano voice is heard, under the dusky sky.",
      "The sounds of high-pitched mewling are muffled by the sounds of the rushing creek.  Along the mud track, tiny footprints are clearly visible.  Judging from the distinct dragging marks that are located behind each set of the footprints it appears that whoever created them also wears a long cloak or perhaps a robe.  The perfectly shaped footprints lead directly toward the creek, where they suddenly disappear.  Off in the distance the melodic sound of a woman singing in a high soprano voice can be heard."
