      "The smithy's lofty ceiling is comprised of rough, smoke-darkened tinders.  The cavernous space holds a man-sized anvil and a forge fed by a low-burning flame that nonetheless fills the smithy with skin-searing heat.  Hafts for gigantic axes and a whalebone pommel meant for an immense sword sit atop a huge worktable of sturdy hoarbeam."
