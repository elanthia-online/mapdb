      "Devoid of nearby furnishings, the western wall is dominated by a flaming phoenix mural that is illuminated by the warm glow of several frosted glaesine globes anchored to the ceiling.  Plush saffron yellow carpeting dappled with burnt umber threads lends the otherwise austere space a coziness that is enhanced by the presence of a plush crimson settee.  A lacquered white door leads to the hallway, while a gold-edged crimson silk curtain provides access to the storage facilities."
