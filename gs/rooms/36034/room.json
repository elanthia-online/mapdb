      "The white felt walls are mostly covered with tapestries of elaborate diamond patterns in a riot of saturated colors.  Wall hooks with blankets hang where the circular wall meets the rafters, which are strung with purple and red streamers.  The rafters end in a roof ring with dangling rustic lanterns, lighting up the bright tapestries and colorful rugs.  The shop is dominated by a sturdy wooden table curving along the walls."
