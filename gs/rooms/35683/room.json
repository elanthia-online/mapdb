      "Riddled with forking cracks, the edge of the disc juts perilously toward an open expanse of the surrounding sea.  Dark waves crash violently against the invisible barrier encircling the ancient monument, pelting the stone with an onslaught of spray that collects in puddles and pools.  Runnels in the stone channel some of the water toward the edges, where it cascades down toward the base of the disc far below."
