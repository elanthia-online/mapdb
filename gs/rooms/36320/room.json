      "Leaded crystal windows line the aft and starboard walls, with daylight pouring in from the outside and shining upon the buffet.  Darkly hued chestnut marble covers the floor, its alabaster and gold veins forming an albatross at the center.  Just around the corner from the tapestry-lined hallway are a pair of crystal doors leading toward the kitchen."
