      "Thick woolen rugs in various shades of violet cushion the floor of the small yurt.  Hanging from the rafters above are several copper lanterns with fruit-etched crystal panes.  Centered in the space is a small wooden bed, its headboard and bedding reflecting a fanciful theme of tarts and berries.  Standing to one side is a large ceramic statue of a beautiful truefolk lass carrying a basket of pastries."
