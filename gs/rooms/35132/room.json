      "Long and dark, a stone plunder hall stands at the base of of the steps climbing toward the Ashka Krol.  The fortified palace looms, dark and predatory, over the street, flying crimson banners in the high winds.  Lit by torches from within, the hall's wide windows betray visions of plunder.  Piles of silver and gold coins glint from beds of black velvet, artworks from distant lands stand amidst suits of strange armor, and gems in a kaleidoscope of colors wink like a rainbow lent solid form."
