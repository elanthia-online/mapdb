      "Pure white squares embroidered with snowflakes alternate with sky blue squares on the quilt that covers the bunk in this cabin.  Set against the starboard bulkhead, and surrounded by the silvery haon of the paneling behind it and the cupboards at its head and foot, the bunk looks roomy even for giantman passengers.  White glaes-shaded lamps hang from gimballed wallmounts near the head and the foot of the bunk."
