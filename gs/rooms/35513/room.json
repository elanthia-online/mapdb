      "A wide entryway opens to a room framed by large rectangular windows with white frosted panes and sheer linen curtains.  Most of the flagstone floor is covered by a musty red rug, while a large desk sits directly opposite the main entrance.  The back wall is lined with several long wooden shelves, each stocked with random trinkets and baubles.  High-backed wooden chairs are arranged in an orderly fashion against the walls."
