    "description": [
      "The open-faced hut, which is topped with palm fronds, is home to a floor of thickly packed mud.  A series of thick, woven cloths, each dyed a deep green akin to the color of the surrounding jungle, are scattered across the floor in heaping piles, partially covering a series of white and red painted sigils.  Crawling along the cloth rolls at a quick pace, a thin line of red ants makes its way from one side of the hut to the other."
