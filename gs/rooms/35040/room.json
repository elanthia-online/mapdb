    "description": [
      "Dark paving stones frame a broad roadway that twists and turns with the jagged switchbacks mounting a spacious plateau.  High walls of rough-hewn basalt loom above, marking the borders of a foreboding city that occupies the flatland.  Though muted by the night, the buzz of the city seeps over the walls: the sound of distant weeping, the creak of a wagon wheel, and the scuffle of a bar fight echo off of the rock to either side of the road."
