      "Bone fetishes dangle from the wood plank ceiling, swaying slightly and clacking together in the heavy, incense-laden air.  Held aloft by a faceless stone idol near the entrance, a shallow bowl of polished flowstone holds glittering baubles within.  Beyond the stolid guardian is a tiered rack made of widowwood.  Like the golvern-inlaid hatch behind it, its flat surfaces are carved with leaping beasts."
