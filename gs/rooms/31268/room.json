      "This cold room is filled with strange-looking equipment and furniture.  Against the wall furthest from the door is a massive wooden wheel with adjustable straps for securing legs and arms.  Two iron tubs sit against one of the side walls with buckets labeled \"Ice Water\" lined up in front of them.  On the opposing wall is a flat wooden bed and a wooden chair, both affixed with countless straps and buckles, with a tall metal cabinet separating them."
