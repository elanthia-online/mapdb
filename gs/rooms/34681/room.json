      "Clinks and clacks of coin being counted echo off of the walls, the product of the tireless work of brokers exchanging currencies.  They work behind the comfort of a carved thanot counter that separates a tidy workspace from the bustle of the countinghouse.  Stacks of foreign promissory notes form neat piles on the brokers' desks, some marked with strange languages, or symbols barely recognizable as words."
