      "Starcharts, miniature parchment models of constellations, and a variety of telescopes line the walls of the small classroom.  Small oak crates marked \"Astrolabe\" sit on each of the benches, though it appears one has escaped its confines as it lays to rest on the black-speckled white tile floor.  Several small windows are inset into the wall, allowing just enough room to view the outside."
