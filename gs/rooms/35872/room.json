    "description": [
      "Cobblestones meet at a crossroads in the east quarter of the promenade, where a briskly moving narrow stream splatters along the settlement's northern edge.  Rushing from its source to the east, the stream bends sharply along smoothed, granite stonework.  On the opposite bank, a cluster of mangroves and taller trees form a tightly compacted, impenetrable wall of wild growth.  To the west, you can hear the splashing of water as it lands in the basin of a magnificent fountain."
