      "The remains of broken shells and shattered wood litter the shoreline, providing a home for countless scavenger creatures to rest in during the night.  The surf takes its toll on the constantly shifting sand of the beach, yet the beauty of the ocean's moonlit horizon remains.  Hazy shafts of moonlight glint off of the splash of pink barely visible beneath the murky ocean water farther out in the waves, calling attention to the presence of a massive coral reef.",
      "Quickly moving reptiles and rodents move between the broken remains of shells and wood washed up on the shoreline as they scavenge for food, before scurrying back to their homes between smaller boulders and debris.  The surf takes its toll on the constantly shifting sand of the beach, yet the beauty of the ocean's horizon remains.  Farther out in the waves, the water's hue changes from deep blue to a vibrant splash of pink as the top of a massive coral reef can be seen."
