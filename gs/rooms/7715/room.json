      "Pieces of a few broken skulls lie discarded upon the ground where the tunnel curves sharply under a low patch of the ceiling.  Faint striations are visible in the dense rock, their greyish tones blending with the pale limestone and dried strands of vegetation in an elaborate shifting pattern."
