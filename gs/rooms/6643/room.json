      "This room appears to be used as living quarters for those who reside in this stronghold.  A row of six bunks lines each of the walls and a row of a dozen cabinets stands opposite the doorway.  A large table stands in the center of the room with a half dozen chairs scattered around it.  Mounted onto the ceiling is a large cast iron chandelier with dozens of small, lit candles dropping wax down onto the top of the table."
