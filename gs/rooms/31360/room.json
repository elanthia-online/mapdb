      "Precisely pruned trees of varying heights give a secluded feeling to the otherwise open expanse of short, pale emerald grass.  A simplistic stairway forms a fanning crescent down the side of a modest hill, adjacent to a sculptural stonework buffet and a bronze patina pedestal.  Warm, twinkling lights float amongst the limbs of back-set red maples that provide a fiery accent to the understated landscape."
