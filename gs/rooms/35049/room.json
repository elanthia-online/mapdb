      "Exposed rafters form an arch over the entryway, the dark pine ceiling filling the air with its rich and clean resinous scent.  Carved totems decorate the support posts that are evenly spaced throughout the corridor and fur stretchers displaying a variety of pelts decorate the spaces between.  Wrought iron brackets support large metal baskets filled with bowls of burning oil that provide both illumination and warmth."
