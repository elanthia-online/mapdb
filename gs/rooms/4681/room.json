      "Colorful dupioni silk tapestries showing various scenes of wizards at work and play conceal one of the shop's stone walls.  The room is illuminated by mullein torches that cast a flickering light along the walls.  Natural recesses in the stone serve as bookcases, housing huge, dusty leather-bound volumes.  A stalagmite draped with an irregular piece of water-stained damask stands in the middle of the room."
