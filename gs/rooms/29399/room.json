      "Trussed in purple-tinged ivy, an eye-catching series of bowed yew trellises are encompassed by a dense copse of flourishing witch hazel trees that drip with spidery gold-crimson flowers.  The dramatic colorscape is intensified by the niveous slate of snow and ice blanketing the rough terrain."
