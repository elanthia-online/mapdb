      "Faded tapestries progress from one end of the room to the other, the worn stitching telling the tale of Gor'nustre's refusal of Selantha's emissaries, the subsequent caravan massacre, and ending with the war against the Kannalan Alliance.  Several niches have been built into the remaining walls, their arched entries draped with dust-filled webs."
