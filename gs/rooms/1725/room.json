      "Sheer rock walls rise several hundred feet on either side of this narrow cleft, and far above the sky is visible.  The walls cast the area into deep shadow, though, and near-invisible patches of ice make the going slow.  The wind whistles noisily through the passage, reverberating off the rock walls to produce a thunderous cacophony.  An icy chute curves steeply upward and out of sight to the southwest."
