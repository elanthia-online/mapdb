      "Travertine pavers weave through the bright green creeping thyme, their smooth faces glistening in the moonlight like tiny ponds in a mossy plain.  Window-dotted storefronts are evenly spaced along the western edge of the promenade, their open windows spilling inviting light into the night.  Topped with glowing frosted globes, immensely tall poles decorated with flapping pennants are spaced at even intervals between the eastern guardrails."
