      "Golden sunlight spills through the large floor-to-ceiling window that occupies the northern wall.  Azure paint provides a gentle backdrop to the white curtains and bedspread, while polished cherrywood boards create a warmly hued floor.  A narrow rattan bed fashioned of beige rattan is positioned against one wall to provide ample living space.  Resting in a corner, beneath a drop lantern of polished glass, is a round rattan chair.",
