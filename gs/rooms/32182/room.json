      "The ground floor of the minaret is packed earth, nearly frozen solid even within the thick walls.  A dusty cushion sits half askew at the base of a stone spiral staircase, the steep curve of which disappears upwards into a distant darkness.  Someone has left a bulky ceramic jug and a few lumpy pottery cups to lie in a dusty pile."
