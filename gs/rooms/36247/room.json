      "A tall bay window draped in thin, dark linen curtains serves as a backdrop to this expansive room.  Twining sage vines adorned in wild sunset-hued gladiolus blooms, frame the window and creep out from behind the curtains, spreading across the back wall and up toward an elaborate eahnor chandelier hanging from the peak of the domed ceiling.  A wide black walnut bookcase rests against one of the brocaded walls.  A leather chair sits behind a black walnut desk."
