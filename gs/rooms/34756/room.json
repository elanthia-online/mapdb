    "description": [
      "Far above, a ceiling of stained glass looms, painting the sunlight in fiery colors as it filters through to fall in sharp-edged shards to the charcoal grey marble floor of the narthex.  Sumptuous curtains of flame-hued velvet frame the walls, save for the northernmost, which boasts a hammered steel arch leading to a grand staircase.  Before it stands a massive throne of steel graced with a froth of gilt and inlaid rubies, empty but for a dark metal crown worked to resemble tongues of leaping flame."
