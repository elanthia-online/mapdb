    "description": [
      "The mouth of the nautilus gapes wide, its curved shell forming an arched cell slick with age and mineral buildup.  Striations in the shell's surface reveal layered growth patterns, while barnacles and small marine encrustations cluster in the deeper grooves in the septa.  A jagged fissure rends through one wall, cutting a direct path toward the core of the spiral."
