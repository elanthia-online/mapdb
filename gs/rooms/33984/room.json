      "Iron-caged sconces frame the vast hallway, the fractured glass illuminating the bloodwood frames lining the brocaded walls in patches of light as the passage branches off into separate wings.  Narrow console tables of lacquer-covered mahogany are interspersed along the passageway, the heavily notched surfaces covered in ribbon-bound bouquets of dried tulips, the flora's colors long faded.  Sanguine-dyed wool covers the parquetry floor along the corridor, the woven carpets subtly unraveling."
