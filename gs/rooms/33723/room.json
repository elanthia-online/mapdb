      "Thick ebon rolton wool covers the polished oak floor, its fibers woven into a geometric pattern.  A polished linden rocking chair rests to one side of a small round table.  A large bookcase dominates one wall while a granite blackboard covers another.  Fashioned from rough planks of wood is a small barrel that sits next to the arch leading to the hallway."
