      "Gentle falls of blue wisteria drape through a woven trellis, their petals partially obscuring a neat clearing of manicured grass.  The hushed burble of water tumbling into a nearby pond plays quiet accompaniment to a sweet chorus of birdsong drifting from the surrounding foliage.  Low wicker tables flanked by cushions rest in a casual semi-circle around a chalkboard, propped up against an ancient pear tree, with great boughs swaying in the alpine breeze and causing dappled sunlight to dance beneath."
