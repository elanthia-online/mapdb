      "A robed elven attendant stands behind a solidly build counter elegantly topped with a mosaic depicting the seal of the warrior guild.  Behind him, expansive windows afford a view of the gardens just beyond.  Two barrels flank the counter, one tightly lidded, but emanating a subtle fragrance noticeable by all who walk past.  The other is open and half-filled with smooth stones waiting to be put to good use."
