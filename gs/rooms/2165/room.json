      "The trail dead-ends at the foot of a precipice, which slopes steeply down to a lower level of the butte.  Magma pools surround the narrow aisle of the path, with hissing lava as the consequence of any misstep.  Over the edge of the drop-off, the faint beginnings of more winding trails can be seen under the pale light of the moon, circumnavigating conflagrant pits and basalt and glaes formations.",
