      "An elongated brocade-draped table slices across the broad room, the candelabra-adorned surface covered in tiered dishes and decanters etched with stylized letter \"A\"s.  Silk-padded chairs encircle the elaborate display, the avian-patterned motif echoed across the claw-footed benches set against the curtained windows.  A widowwood-framed portrait dominates the northern wall, the subject's visage flickering as the wall-affixed sconces whip tongues of flame across the glass."
