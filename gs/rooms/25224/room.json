    "description": [
      "Whipped by the winds and punished by sunlight as hot as a forge-fire, the dunes are in constant motion, tossed as if waves on an actual sea.  A constant roaring thrum, like a tide about to crash, fills the air with deafening power, as if the so-called 'singing' sands are actually screaming themselves hoarse.  Nary a scrap of brush nor hardy cactus dares challenge their power in this place: there is sand, and only sand, all about."
