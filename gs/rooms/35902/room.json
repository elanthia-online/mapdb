      "The dark spaces within the skull are intermittently interrupted by the angular edges of a pale, bony interior.  Small fractures run across the top and widen into cracks as they branch toward a large, jagged gash in one side that reveals the only way out.  The one remaining eye socket is angled outward on the opposite side, serving as a makeshift window from within this bizarre space."
