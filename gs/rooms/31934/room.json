      "Lacquered planks of pitch black ebonwood cover the walls of the cottage, the wood carved in stylized calligraphy around a series of sigils filled with gilded ink.  A pentagram of dark-colored flora hovers over a cluster of wood-carved forms, the metal frame suspended by thick rings of blackened iron wrapped in dark emerald ivy, each tendril snaking across a melted candle set at each point.  A faint reddish black haze rises from beneath the haon floor, seeping through the boards before dissipating into a fine mist.",
