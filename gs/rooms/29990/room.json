      "The tunnelway grows narrow, high walls full of open graves looming monstrously over the dark path.  Dry timbers from shattered burial boxes lie scattered on the floor, accompanied by hanks of brittle hair and shards of dry bone.  Many of the hollows along the walls are empty and their edges scored with clawlike marks."
