      "This warehouse is absolutely packed with all manner of baubles and knick-knacks.  Despite the large number of displayed items, great care has obviously gone into organizing the shelves, for nothing seems cluttered or haphazard.  Attendants move through out the room, delicately adjusting and cleaning each piece, while responding to the needs of any potential customer."
