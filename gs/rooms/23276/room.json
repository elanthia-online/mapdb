    "description": [
      "Constant activity in this spacious bailey keeps the swirling snow from blanketing the cobbled courtyard.  Wooden stables and storerooms cling to the perimeter walls, but the grey granite exterior of the compound's towering inner keep is bare except for an incised cornerstone.  Crenellated battlements top the keep, overhanging the steep structure like a beetled brow, and obscuring the stars behind them.  Tucked into a protected corner near the northern stables is a small fountain.  To the south, a snow-dusted marble statue presides over a row of archery butts."
