      "This grove is exclusively populated by massive firewheel trees, their branches intermingling into an impressive canopy shot through with brilliantly colored flowers.  A pathway encircles the grove, stretching out to the northwest and northeast, while a wooden archway leads back towards the main festival grounds."
