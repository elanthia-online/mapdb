      "The floor is covered in a silver-on-blue patterned carpet, which hides almost all of the stone beneath its fine fabric, leaving only a small margin around the room's edges.  A fireplace takes up one wall, the space over its mantle occupied by a framed portrait.  Other paintings, each one suspended down a length of sapphire ribbon, hang alongside the frame of a silver doorway.  A cushioned settee and matching chair are positioned to take advantage of the hearth's warmth."
