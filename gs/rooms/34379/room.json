      "Seemingly suspended between two bridges, the north ledge does not connect with the wall at the floor, making movement somewhat problematic.  Periodic vibrations rumble through the cavern and rattle the floating stone slab, bits of rock crumbling free and falling to the chasm floor.  There are a number of persistent trickles, liquid threads from floor to ceiling, greatly resembling puppet strings."
