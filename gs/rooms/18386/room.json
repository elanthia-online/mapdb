      "Marking the apex of a gentle curve in the wheel-rutted dirt road is a long wooden hitching post, adorned at its ends by wreaths of bright flowers and ribbons that flutter in the slightest breeze.  Beyond the post, green grass stretches along the sides of an eastward path, and in the distance, the peaks of roofs rise against the sky."
