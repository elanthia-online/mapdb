      "Dusty, pale moonlight filters into the tunnel from an opening to the south, its dim illumination outlining the crags and crevices in the uneven rock walls.  The tunnel floor is coated with a thick layer of dust and fine sediment which has formed into small piles along the base of the walls.  The glint of smooth stone shows through in many places where the dust has been disturbed by frequent passage through the tunnel.  Somewhere deep below the tunnel floor, a low humming sound vibrates through the rock.",
