      "The Aerie is a monumental construction, possessing a vast interior that captures the essence of floating within a cloud.  Cantilevered sections of the ceiling cascade down toward a stage at the far end of the chamber, naturally amplifying any discourse occurring there.  Rows of seats crafted of light-toned teak are set in descending rows, and the floor and stage curtains are tinted a soft tone of aquamarine, completing an overall schema of airiness and light.  Three vaulted arches provide exits."
