      "This simple room is a cube carved from the granite surrounding the hall deep below ground.  While the room's interior surfaces are smooth, they lack the marble finish of the hall outside.  Across from a modest wooden door, an ironwood desk resides under an insignia of a crossed silver pick-and-shovel flanked by some heavy iron sconces that emit golden light on the room below.  Some bookcases and barrels full of reading material line the walls."
