      "The path gradually slopes down towards a gentle depression in the forest floor that is populated by massive flowering trees, their branches hanging low and shrouding the entire area in heavy shadows.  Nestled amongst the tree trunks, a series of wooden tubs have been built, and a smiling young Iyo woman stands to one side of them, casually poking a stick at the brightly painted wooden ducks within."
