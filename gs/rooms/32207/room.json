      "Their frightful faces flickering with fiery light, carved ghost pumpkins decorate the splintered shelves and dusty corners in festively arranged trios.  A display case stretches out from the maple counter, its glass front shattered over the petrified pies within.  Beside a rusty potbelly stove, taxidermy carrion birds perch on the mantel over a caved-in brick hearth, eternally caught in mid-flight."
