      "A spiraled staircase is visible beneath a trapdoor that opens onto a wooden rooftop platform enclosed by a black iron balustrade.  Offering a bird's-eye view of the grounds below, the lookout surrounds a massive stone chimney, a line of sand-filled buckets, and scum-topped rain barrels nearby.  A sleek ebony raven perches on a railing-mounted brass telescope."
