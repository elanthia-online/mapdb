      "Glinting shards of sunlight fall onto the sandstone slab floor of the chamber, revealing faint carvings in the stone shaped like paw prints.  They wind between the forms of cats carved from bloodwood and ebony that range in size from the meanest housecat to powerful lions.  All look toward a broad altar ablaze with beeswax candles, their honeyed scent mingling with cinnamon and sandalwood incense.  The wall behind the altar is limned with the image of a man with a cruel smile and lambent golden eyes."
