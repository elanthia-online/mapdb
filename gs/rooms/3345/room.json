      "The peculiar tang of tea and cigars drifts momentarily in the air, then disappears like an apparition, replaced by the brisk smell of fresh fallen snow.  Smoke curls lazily upwards, loosely swirling around itself before it dissipates high in the sky.  Bungalows and cabins huddle together on the ground, fighting to stay warm."
