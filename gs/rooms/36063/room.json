    "description": [
      "Grasslands roll outward in wide, unbroken waves, their yellow-green tones shifting beneath the wind as the path extends toward the north where mists rising from the lake cast a pale glow around the distant village of scattered gers.  To the east, a river slips from the water's edge and winds toward buckthorn, larch, and rowan that act as vanguard to a dark forest.   West and south, the expanse continues without interruption, while far to the north, snow-capped peaks form a plum-hued backdrop."
