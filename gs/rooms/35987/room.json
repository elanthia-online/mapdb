      "This room seems smaller than the others, and smells lightly of pine.  There is a large bay window on the far side of the room.  Against one wall is a simple down bed covered with a dark blue quilted blanket and a few pillows.  A fine oak desk takes a corner near the window, with a single leather-backed chair in front.  A small bookshelf is bolted above the desk."
