      "The abounding crowds are mostly quiet as they pass by the eastern wall of a mossy stone library standing taller than most of the surrounding businesses.  Though the hush is punctuated here and there by a distant hawker's cry or the drifting sound of chanted prayers, the edifice seems to cast a pall as long and somber as its stretching shadow.  At the zenith of the library gate is a slit-pupiled eye of fire opal and obsidian depicted against a field of grey moonstones."
