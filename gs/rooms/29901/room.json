      "Underbrush and towering conifers alike seem unwilling to trespass onto the pale stone roadway.  The frost-laden wall of flora ends several paces from the pale stone walkway, but there is no sign that it has been cut back or cultivated in a way that would explain the stark delineation.  Unintelligible whispers play on the air, audible only in rare lulls of the screeching wind."
