      "Coral columns rise from the reef bed, framing a secluded space, where stone shelves nestle in natural alcoves, lined with fragments of sea glass.  Fissures pulse with glowing algae, casting shifting patterns across rough surfaces.  Glasstide roses emerge from coral niches, their translucent petals undulating in gentle currents."
