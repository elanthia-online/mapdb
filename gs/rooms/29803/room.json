      "A low-hanging lantern sways from a rafter overhead, lighting the walls which are crafted from old, wooden planks.  A hand-carved oak rack and some low shelves have been nailed to the wall near a lopsided door.  In the middle of the room, the oaken floor has been cut away, revealing the frozen pond beneath with several holes chopped in the ice allowing access to the frigid water.  Stools have been placed around the opening in the floor, while thick furs are piled in one corner near a wood burning stove."
