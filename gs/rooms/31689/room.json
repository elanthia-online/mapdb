    "description": [
      "The steep rise of the trail begins to level as the peak nears, and the trees begin to thin to smaller growth shrubs, still full of the same vibrant hues as their larger cousins.  Somewhere along the path, the golden red glow backing the orchard ridge has begun to give way to the twilight of the land beneath it, and the sky becomes a melange of blues and indigos colliding with tendrils of gilded crimson."
