      "Gold deposits are visible along the quartz ceiling and northern wall, untouched by the miners of this irregular maze deep below the mountains.  This section of the topsy-turvy tunnel arcs from northeast and northwest.  While the vertigo-inducing geometry of the tunnel makes travel difficult, the floor is relatively clear of debris."
