      "This room is decorated in stark wintery hues.  A deep black carpet patterned with spiralling silver horns covers the floor, while pure white curtains frame silvery-grey walls.  The large four-post bed features oversized silver pillows above an elaborately embroidered comforter.  An elegant crystal vase on each night table holds a small bouquet of white narcissus."
