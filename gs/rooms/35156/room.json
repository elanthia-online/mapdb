      "[The Raider's Take, Mead Hall]"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Partially covered by the overhang of the inn's western and eastern roofs, the mead hall is filled with tables and benches.  Bronze braziers are arranged down the central aisle between tables, keeping the open space cozy and warm.  Pine needles are scattered about the ground, likely fallen from the crooked larch that bends over the inn.  Built against the southern wall of the inn, a long white and ebon bar is sheltered by the roof and offers a variety of fares, while various steps lead deeper into the structure."
