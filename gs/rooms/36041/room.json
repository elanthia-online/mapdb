      "Strips of fabric and leather decorate the twine-suspended wooden loops scattered across the framework of the wool-draped ger, the bundles of material bound by knotted threads.  Several sheepgrass baskets encircle the perimeter of a low-set juniper table at the center of the room, the trinket-filled containers interspersed by small wool-stuffed toy goats."
