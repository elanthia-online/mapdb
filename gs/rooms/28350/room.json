      "Prismatic light scatters across the floor at the western edge of the chamber, its soft rainbow hues filling the air with an almost ethereal light.  Stabbing downward from the ceiling, a stalactite to the south nearly touches a bone-white pool filled with water, while clusters of debris darken the opposing corners.  Half-painted, a white and black mural spreads its imagery beneath a long stone shelf that is deeply carved into the stone wall."
