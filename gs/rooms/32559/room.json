      "Gilt on an ancient painting gleams from the walls, though time has made the thin metallic layer peel at the edges.  Flanked by graves carved into the walls, the mural depicts golden, winged figures soaring above a gate that is blacker than the surrounding shadows.  A displaced skull lies on the ground, its empty eye sockets fixed on the artwork."
