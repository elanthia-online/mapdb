      "A thin mist drifts over cracked obsidian tiles, curling toward a warped archway framing the exit opposite a sturdy door leading toward the back office.  A splintered lectern leans against the far wall, flanked by sagging banners covered in soot and dust.  Overhead, a crooked chain suspends a lantern with a cold, blue-green flame casting shadows upon a broken trunk turned askew."
