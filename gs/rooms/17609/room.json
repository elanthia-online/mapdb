      "A small but detailed sculpture of a leaping dolphin has been carved from ice, an expansive ocean of ice covering most of the table below it.  Various holes have been carved into the icy ocean and hold delicate glasses of sparkling champagne.  Fine crystal stemware hangs from silver hooks nearby to refill the elaborate display."
