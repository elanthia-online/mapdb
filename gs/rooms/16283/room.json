      "The most prominent thing about this room is the long staircase that winds upward towards the sky.  Each step is crafted from the natural rock of the cavern, and no two steps are entirely even.  The rock walls are much eroded, and water trickles around several small cubbies created from years of water damage.  Several vials, conveniently filled with multi-colored dyes, are neatly placed within the cubbies."
