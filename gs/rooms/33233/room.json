      "A short bollard has been painted green, standing out against the smooth, pale planks of a short pier jutting off the beach.  The dark waters glisten in the moonlight, and faint phosphorescence can be seen in the distance.  Further inland, a long cobbled pathway leads into lush tropical flora redolent of heady fragrances."
