      "Four arrow slits have been cut into the tower wall, but their placement is much too low for the average person to use.  As low as the slots might be though, it hasn't stopped the seabirds of the island from using them for nesting.  Each of the holes is filled with a woven mixture of dried grass, palm fronds and dead seaweed."
