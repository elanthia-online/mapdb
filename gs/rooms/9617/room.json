    "description": [
      "A muskrat splashes quickly into the water, startled by your approach.  Its den is barely visible in the reeds that grow at the river's side, sheltered by a group of mired logs that divert the river's force away.  The river hurls past, deep and swift, carrying everything it can grasp quickly downstream.  A thick rope dangles over the water a bit upstream, and thus far it appears to be the only passage to the western bank."
