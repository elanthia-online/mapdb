      "The stone walls of the spacious chamber are covered with tapestries, luxurious hangings which still boast vibrant color and fanciful designs.  A majestic bed stands in the room's center, hung with heavy velvet in a deep shade of blue.  Tall windows between the wall hangings offer a breathtaking view of the lake through their glazed crystal panes, still unbroken despite the decay elsewhere in Castle Anwyn."
