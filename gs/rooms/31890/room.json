      "A pair of high-backed chairs separated by a low table huddle in front of a dark stone fireplace, the dying embers of a fire glowing within.  Along one grey-striped, papered wall sits a sturdy oaken sideboard with open drawers, its contents neat and orderly.  Tucked away beneath a narrow stairway, wooden bins full of colorful bits of fabric are nearly hidden from view."
