      "The var is nearly deserted as it meanders northward toward the belltower visible against the moonlit sky.  In a nearby cottage's dooryard, a tiny garden has been cultivated, its centerpiece a small birdbath.  A trickle of water breaks the silence, burbling cheerfully as it flows down the tiny statue inside the birdbath's bowl.",

      "The var meanders onward toward a nearby bell tower, which rises, lit and glowing, above the blue-tiled rooftops. Between two houses' dooryards, a tiny garden has been cultivated, its centerpiece a small birdbath.",
