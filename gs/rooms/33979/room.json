    "description": [
      "Held mostly at bay by some unknown force, the jungle looms large upon the perimeter.  Rising out of the wild approach, a brick and ashlar manor dominates the area, dwarfing the metal skeletal remains of a ferris wheel and a carousel scattered on the overgrown lawn, wild clumps of grass and vines entangling themselves across the paint-faded rides.  A gated ashlar wall separates the eastern lawn from the rest, and the cobblestone path leading in from a pair of tall iron gates narrows to a small trail wrapping behind the property."
