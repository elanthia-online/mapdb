      "The foyer of this shop provides an illusion of standing in a great hall which is further enhanced by the gold-framed mirrors lining the walls between the ivory columns in the corners. The tall ceilings are framed by gold and blue draperies that pool onto the polished walnut floor.  Carved into the floor, and inlaid with pearl, is intricate scrollwork creating a neverending pattern of swirls."
