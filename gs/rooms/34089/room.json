      "Rows of benches fill the center portion of the classroom, most of them neatly arranged together.  A desk stands at the front of the room, its surface organized with stacks of parchment and books.  In the back of the classroom, a few satchels and bags have been left by their owners who were obviously in a rush to leave for home."
