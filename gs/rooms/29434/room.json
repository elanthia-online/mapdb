      "Divided into two lanes of commerce that face each other in mirrored exuberance, the pathway tapers slightly and follows a subtle bend that closer approaches the craggy hillsides beyond.  Overflowing tables and shipping crates are stacked besides the storefronts, just behind the more eye-catching displays that are attractively arranged for passing customers."
