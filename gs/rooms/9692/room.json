      "The trees give ground at the edge of a swift stream, running through its rocky banks in a raging torrent.  A couple of large boulders sitting mid-stream send plumes of spray into the air as the water collides with them.  A few sunbeams penetrate the thick canopy of branches reaching out overhead from the trees lining the bank, creating flickering rainbows in the shifting cloud of mist.",

A couple of large boulders sitting mid-stream send plumes of spray into the air as the water collides with them.  A shifting pattern of moonlight penetrates the thick canopy of branches reaching out overhead from the trees lining the bank, sparkling off the roiling surface of the stream."
