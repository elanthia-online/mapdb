      "Separated from the hubbub of the bar by a dusty velvet curtain, a pair of sturdy wooden chairs face each other across a scarred pine table.  A flickering oil lamp casts eerie shadows on the dark-paneled walls, lacing the somber ambience of the nook with a hint of intrigue.  A musty smell lingers near a shelf filled with leather-bound logbooks, their spines cracked and yellowed."
