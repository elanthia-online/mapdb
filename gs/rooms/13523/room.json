      "An Arkati pantheon painting hangs on one of the refined oak-paneled walls, and a viridian Vornavian silk ceiling rises overhead.  A scarred ship's figurehead sits in one corner of a varnished dark oak floor.  There is a glass-topped mistwood counter on one side of the shop and a set of carved felwood shelves on the other."
