      "A low dome of woven seaweed and driftwood forms a cozy nook just beyond the passage.  Softly luminescent sea stars freckle the walls, their light catching on tangled strands of wire and glimmering bits of sea glass dangling from the ceiling like strange chandeliers.  A worktable cobbled together from a ship's hatch groans beneath piles of broken gadgets and clouded jars.  A barrel labeled \"PARTS?\" lies on its side, scattering a chaotic farrago of sprockets, pearls, and ribbon."
