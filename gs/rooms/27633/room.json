      "Enclosed by thick slate walls, the shop features some potted luminescent toadstools in the center of its sea glass floor.  A fused sun and moon wall-hanging hangs under the skylight-set ceiling.  Right near the front is a large white wicker counter and some hammered copper display hooks.",
      "Pale oak walls rise from a swirled sea glass floor.  Just above some potted luminescent toadstools hangs a fused sun and moon wall-hanging, and a low skylight-set ceiling completes the picture.  A narrow glass-topped table stands in the middle of the room."
