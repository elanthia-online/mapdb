      "Occupying most of the exterior wall, a large bay window rimed in hoarfrost at its corners offers an unobstructed view of the winter wonderland beyond its panes, while pendant lanterns dangling from the exposed-rafter ceiling create a soft glow throughout the space.  Tables and mahogany chairs are scattered throughout the area, their mahogany bodies arranged in social circles upon amber and niveous area rugs.  A long counter stands before an archway leading to the kitchen, its surface covered in enticing offerings."
