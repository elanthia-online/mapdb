      "Looking more like a lounge than the typical pub, the room is furnished with low divans and thickly cushioned chairs assembled around tables in vague groupings.  Behind a scuffed bar, a mirror reflects the oddly shaped liquor bottles lining the shelves.  Dimly lit by scattered pillar candles, a long mural fills the wall nearest a tiled arch."
