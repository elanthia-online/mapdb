      "Granite walls draped in coral honeysuckle rise upon the southwestern edge of a pathway that is dotted with ages-old boulders and blanketed with spongy sheet grass.  Beyond the natural barrier, the outline of a colorful garden growing upon an upward slope can be seen.  A series of tall and wide juniper, their trunks twisted and turned about, keeps guests from nasty falls over the edge."
