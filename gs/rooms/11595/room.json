      "The floor, the ceiling and the walls are all constructed of the same ash planking.  Placed every few feet is a thick support column of tarred oak.  Pale, thin light is provided by a softly glowing orb hanging from the ceiling in the center of the entryway.  Dust covers everything.  The air is stale and absolutely still."
