      "[Mountain Trail, Plateau]"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Several trails lead up to this plateau.  A strong wind blows from the northeast, howling across the openness of the plateau.  A small tree still clings to the rocks, fighting the constant wind.  Small claw marks have shredded the base of the tree.  The trail to the east slopes downward towards a dark crevice in the rock.  To the northeast and southeast the trail follows a ridge around the sides of the crevice."
