      "The warm humid air of this tropical retreat invites you to cast away your worries and cares.  Flowering vines creep up the carved posts of a four-poster bed which provides support for a canopy of rustling ferns.  Water trickles from a fountain, cunningly crafted to resemble a waterfall, and fills a small bathing pool near the fireplace.  Several colorful cushions are scattered on the floor near the hearth."
