      "Alternating bark-heavy and fully sanded timber is tightly stacked to create makeshift railings, tables, and displays hung with a variety of kaajkur and kaajkur accessories.  The area immediately surrounding the wares is well-lit by blazing lanterns, several of which spout blue flames, but the heavy, dark velvet tent fabric seems to eat up the light closer to the shadowed walls.  Circling a silver cart near the entry, a collection of incense and candles fills the air with the heavy scent of vanilla and pine trees."
