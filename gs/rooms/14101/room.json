      "Upon the east wall is a large carved wheel from a ship.  The spokes are carved in fanciful representations of sea creatures.  The large bedstead is covered in a thick blue and gold quilt.  A fireplace fills one wall, with a hand carved model of a sailing ship on the mantle.  Wide windows look out over the bay outside."
