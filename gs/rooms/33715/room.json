      "Bordering one side of a small stone cottage, a stand of linden trees grows among a covering of painted ferns, their feathery foliage offering little shade from the sun above.  Along the other side, an ornate stone bird bath is placed by a thick hedgerow of honeyberry bushes.  Centered in the beautiful garden is a small grey stone pond flanked with twin wooden benches and surrounded by a light-pebbled walkway that branches off, leading up to a large glaesineth glasshouse."
