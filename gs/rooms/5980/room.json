      "Squatting under the skeletal branches of two dead fruit trees, a round stone cistern oozes water from a large crack in its side.  Covered with a badly warped oak-paneled roof and coated with a thick growth of moss, the cistern appears to be fed from an underground spring, although it quickly loses the water it gains through the damage in its exterior wall.  Long-bladed grasses feed off the escaping water, growing strong and lush around the base of the stone container.",
