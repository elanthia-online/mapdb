      "Netting-draped stalls flank the faenor-railed bridge ascending the cliffside, the walkway set against a backdrop of garden-topped buildings surrounded by open-air booths.  Several fishing poles lean against the rope-bound posts dotting along the boardwalk, their brightly colored lures dangling towards the resaeun-carved stools lined across the dock.  Tall rhimar-bound racks display the fresh catches of the day while a variety of conches and mollusks sit in kelp-filled buckets close by."
