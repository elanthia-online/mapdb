      "Blackened from a previous mishap with fire, the wooden table in one corner of the room has a rickety bench tucked beneath it.  Lining the back wall of this spacious room, sturdy oak planks serve as bookshelves housing over a dozen thick, leather-bound tomes.  Directly opposite the bookcase stands an oval-shaped glass counter, completely empty except for a lantern capped with a multicolored glass globe."
