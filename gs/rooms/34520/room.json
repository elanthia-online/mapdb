      "Swirling mist has all but obscured the surrounding walls, creating what appears to be an endless vortex of thick fog.  At the center of the smoke stands an ancient granite monolith which hums with some unseen energy.  Shadows creep along the edges of the giant statue, as if staining its surface in darkness."
