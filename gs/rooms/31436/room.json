      "A pair of rotted planks balanced upon two mold encrusted mason blocks are the only furnishing of this damp spartan quarter.  The ground is soft and sticky from the effluent of prior occupants.  The air is humid and reeks of foul smelling leftovers of partially decomposing fish remnants and other things that you do not care to identify.  A barred window set high above one wall allow what little fresh air and light to barely pierce the repugnance of this holding cell."
