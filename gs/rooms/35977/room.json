      "High above, the canopy loosens to let in scattered traces of sky, its pale light falling across a small glade where a carpet of blooming heather blooms in low swathes of muted purple.  To the west, tall oak and spruce rise in close ranks, their roots tangled amid dense stands of fern.  The path curves through the forest, its surface broken by half-buried stones that catch the light and seem to glow against the shadowed earth."
