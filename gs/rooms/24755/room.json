      "This room is somewhat stark in its simplicity.  The furniture is well-made yet strictly functional, reflecting an owner with an appreciation for fine craftsmanship.  Along the upper walls are various trophy heads, including one rather startled-looking cave troll.  The room is neat and orderly, with just a few personal touches to indicate that someone actually lives here."
