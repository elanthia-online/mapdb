      "The beach curves inward, forming a small, secluded cove protected by rocky arms draped in trailing vines.  Clusters of waterlogged driftwood have been relinquished by the tides and dot the pale sands in great number.  An enormous silvery grey log is by far the largest, and has resisted being reclaimed by the sea for long enough to have become caked with the droppings of gulls."
