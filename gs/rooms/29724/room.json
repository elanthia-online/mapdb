      "Hanging from the rafters of this spacious tent is a series of woven baskets filled with flowers that create a fragrant canopy above.  A small counter covered with bits of leaves and petals rests under a set of wooden shelves.  Set to one side is a narrow table covered with vases, their slender necks filled with a variety of colorful blossoms."
