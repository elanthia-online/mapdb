      "Smooth, round rocks rise from the sea bed beneath the dark blue waters to create a barrier around a small cove.  Stretching across the face of the island, beyond the rocks, is a small beach filled with glistening white sands.  Passage into the cove is efficiently blocked by the large, stony boulders."
