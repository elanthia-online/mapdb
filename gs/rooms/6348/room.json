      "Dark modwir tables gleam softly in the pale blue light cast by several small crystalline orbs set in the center of the tables.  A quiet thrumming sound is heard every few moments from the dark spheres as they occasionally dim and then glow stronger.  The subtle, rhythmically-shifting illumination provides a peaceful atmosphere for relaxing study."
