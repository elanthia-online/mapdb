    "description": [
      "Set at the center of the memorial garden is a smooth riverstone obelisk, surrounded in a circle of yellow pebbles with paths that issue off in four different directions.  Four squares of bright emerald green grass envelop the circle and are divided by the four exiting pathways.  At the edge of the pebbled circle, where grass meets stone, benches are placed facing the obelisk.  A solemness radiates from the riverstone memorial accompanied by the quiet prayers of the occassional monk seated upon one of the nearby benches."
