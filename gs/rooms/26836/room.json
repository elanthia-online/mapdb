      "On either side of the crumbling cobblestone street stands a long row of three-story buildings, their brick facades covered with chipping plaster.  The occasional balcony, none appearing particularly stable, hangs along the upper floors.  Streetside posts dangle square iron cages, their candles extinguished, although the area remains full of shadows.  The otherwise unbroken line of buildings to the north is cleaved by a dark alleyway."
