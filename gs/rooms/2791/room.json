      "A tall, leaded-glass window stretching from rafters to floor cuts off the hall's further progress, offering in exchange an expansive view of the pine-mantled mountains surrounding the inn.  On the left is a handsome oak door and opposite that, a large painting occupies almost the entire wall.  The wintry light sparkles through the diamond shaped panes in the window, throwing reflections off the polish of the oak floor.",
