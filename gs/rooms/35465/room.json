      "Oilcloth, stained in pale forest hues, spreads between the overhead weave of tree limbs before draping down into a simple arrangement of walls.  Various sticks peek out from a series of thin wooden cylinders at the rear of the space, while shelves shaped after miniature trees are sparsely spread about.  Soft underfoot, moist grass and leaves cushion the hyrrad's interior."
