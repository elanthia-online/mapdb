      "Everything in this small room is covered in a thin layer of dust.  Bookshelves piled high with recordbooks line the walls, leaning precariously.  An elderly clerk sits behind a tremendous hardwood desk, shuffling papers about restlessly.  A small sign is propped up on the corner of the desk."
