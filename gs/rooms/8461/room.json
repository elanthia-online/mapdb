    "description": [
      "The trail is little more than a game path winding through the rugged mountains, although no animal tracks are visible in the hard-packed dirt.  The silence is oppressive, weighing down upon you and making you strain your ears in hopes of catching any sound, even one you might not want to hear.  A small trail meets this one from the mountain to the west, cutting a precarious way across the slope.",
