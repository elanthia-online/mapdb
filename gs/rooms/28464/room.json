      "The heavy wooden doors open into a large, austere room.  At regular intervals, elaborately carved sconces dot the walls.  Though plentiful, the wall-sconces' flickering lights provide poor illumination in the cool, dank room.  The macabre, chiseled designs of the candleholders cast frightful, looming shapes upon the smooth stone walls.  A large portrait of a rather small and unassuming man is the lone decoration adorning the walls of the room."
