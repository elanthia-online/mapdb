      "A rudimentary figure of wicker stands watch over the village's tall houses.  Flowers woven into its joints sway on the breeze in a soft susurrus, lending their perfume to the frigid air.  Earthenware jugs of rendered whale oil sit in formation by the guardian, hinting at the guardian's eventual fate."
