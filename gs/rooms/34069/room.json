      "Stately manses with slate-shingled rooftops stand far from the road, their walks protected by severe gates of black steel.  One such gate has a gargoyle's head sprouting from the stone lintel above, its black glass eyes glittering malevolently in the daylight.  Many of the houses sport evergreen hedge mazes in their yards as if to further thwart any callers boorish enough to come for a casual visit."
