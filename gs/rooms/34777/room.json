      "Silver leaf and gilt illuminate artwork on the wall above a raised dais mounted by a set of steps.  The figure, a man with an unkempt beard in rough homespun robes, is bent with the weight of age and knowledge.  His aged eyes balefully look down upon a carved stone altar draped in offerings of lavender, bay laurel, and Vornavian hemlock.  Atop the altar stands a slender grey obelisk, simple in form but intricate in craftsmanship."
