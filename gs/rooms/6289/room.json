      "An errant ray of light illuminates dozens of cold glittering eyes.  They stare malignantly at you from down the corridor, sparkling with cold metallic hatred, until the soothing calm of reason returns them to bits of unmined gold.  Kobold picks have tunneled around the vein of gold in search of precious loam.  Perhaps the little brutes have left it here reflecting upon the virtue of poverty, perhaps because metal is heavy, or perhaps simply because the word \"gold\" is difficult to pronounce."
