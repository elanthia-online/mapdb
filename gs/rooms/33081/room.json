      "The external defenses are well-stocked here with ships flanked by cannons and stacks of ammunition, and the enormous deck is intentionally rough to provide firm footing.  The inner edge drops sharply off into a large expanse of ocean with a sturdy railing and gate system protecting against accidental plunges.  A series of painted buoys is wrapped around a few sturdy posts, and a rope ladder is coiled near another.  There are deep gouges at the railing's gate, as if someone or something fought hard before going over."
