    "description": [
      "A narrow trail winds precariously through dense green foliage, nearly obscured by the fronds of lush ferns and the creeping tendrils of thick vines.  Birds flit raucously between branches, their vainglorious plumage briefly catching the sunlight filtering through the thick canopy.  The air is as heavy with humidity as it is with the exotic fragrance of tropical flowers, the latter interspersed with occasional hints of decaying vegetation from the jungle floor."
