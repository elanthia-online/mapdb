      "Rows of barley, tightly bunched, form a long, dark ribbon that spirals through the field to the southwest.  The spiral begins with a wide loop that encompasses the ends of the field, then revolves inward until it runs out of room in the middle of the field and comes to a halt.  Two small trenches, one on either side of the spiral, drain water away from the barley plants and keep their roots dry.  The trenches themselves are too muddy to traverse.",
