      "Dried ears of corn, their surfaces split and faded, are scattered all over the floor of this partially capsized stall.  A cracked display stand seems to have escaped the destruction of the rest of the space, while a slatted wooden crate painted with a stylized ear of corn sits askew in one corner.  A crooked curtain hangs partially from the ceiling and seems to hide a potential storage space.  The air is musty and smells of stale popcorn."
