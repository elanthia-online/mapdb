      "Tall hedges form a small maze beyond the house-lined roadway, the untended briars closing in the entry in a thick wall of thorns.  A shattered circle of pale grey benches sits before the maze, the stones covered in rust-colored stains, the markings following the cobblestone trail towards the main path."
