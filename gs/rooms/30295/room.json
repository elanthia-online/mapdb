      "Nibbling on brittlebrush and leafy groundcover that creeps across the sand, goats graze beneath the shade of a cluster of palms between the glittering oasis and a tonal blue linen pavilion.  A well-trodden path, fraught with overhanging, magenta-swept prickly pear cacti, wends through assorted booths and stalls.  Warm breezes shift the beaded garlands hanging on a pebbled morduska hide tent, the rattling sound nearly inaudible over the din of chattering merchants and patrons."
