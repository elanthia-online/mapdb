      "The gravel-lined path bordered with fences overgrown with night blooming jasmine vines winds between two caged enclosures.  On one side of the path, a silvery mithril-barred enclosure houses a small bronze-clawed firecat.  Opposing the mithril enclosure is a glass-enclosed frozen tundra habitat.",
      "The air is perfumed with the heavy scent of jasmine emanating from the open blooms along that cover the low fence bordering the path.  On one side of the path, a silvery mithril-barred enclosure houses a small bronze-clawed firecat.  Opposing the mithril enclosure is a glass-enclosed frozen tundra habitat."
