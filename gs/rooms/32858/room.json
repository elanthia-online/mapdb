      "Pale green sheers billow in the breeze from open glass doors guarded by a wrought iron step balcony.  A tri-fold crystal mirror rests beside a rose-carved pearwood archway opposite an Inn News chalkboard.  Silver flyrsilk covers the sofa and armchairs grouped upon a floral-patterned paeline rug.  Dominating the far wall is a large oil painting above a marble-topped long pearwood sideboard.  A polished brass bin sits beside a pale jade ramie silk curtain embroidered with the Silvergate Inn crest."
