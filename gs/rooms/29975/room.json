      "The sounds of sluggish liquid moving in the lightless pits to either side of the path is a constant, wet whisper in the darkness.  Bitter and coppery, the odor filtering up from the chasms is almost overpowering.  Along the eastern wall, skeletal bodies are draped half out of their niches.  Though still, they look as if stilled in the midst of crawling forth from their disturbed graves."
