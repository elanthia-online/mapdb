      "High blocks of caliginous basalt stand along one side of the path through the market, rivets in the blocks securing the broken remains of chains.  They are almost obscured by a collection of tents from abroad flying several foreign standards and personal banners.  One hexagonal pavilion to the fore of the group is paneled in bright red and sunny yellow silks."
