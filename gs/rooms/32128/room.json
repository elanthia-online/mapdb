      "Shrouded in thick white mist, a dimly glowing violet webwork of tendrils extends across the water here and blocks passage beyond.  A dilapidated rickety fishing dock has been irreparably damaged, the end nearest to the tendrils rotted away and blackened with ichor, the other end of the dock disappearing into mist to the northeast.  Mangroves slowly rise and fall along the bank on the opposite side, dimly glowing as they reach the apex of each belabored cycle."
