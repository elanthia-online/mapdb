      "Closely nestled homes shadowed by acutely overgrown flora create a dark and staggered backdrop to an abundant amount of glistening spikes of metal that protrude from the moist ground.  Patches of deep crimson sibirica surrender a blood-like tinge to droplets of dew that cling to the metallic protrusions, and in intermittent moments of sunlight, cast a similar hue along the ground.  A white cedar sign secured to a tall rod iron post marks the entrance to a small village.",
