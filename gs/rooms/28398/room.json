      "Visibility here is drastically curtailed by a near-opaque mist.  You can just make out the center rope beneath your feet as the ragged fibers of the handrails keep you on track.  The sound of breaking waves is stronger here, and a darkness looms ahead, though it's impossible to make out any details.  Becoming far clearer as it stretches towards the mainland, the rope bridge all but vanishes in the direction of the mist."
