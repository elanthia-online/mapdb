      "The bustle of the camp is in full swing here, in the midst of it all.  Paths wind off in a variety of directions, snaking their way between shelters and small domestic areas, artisans who've set out workshops, and guardposts, ever watchful and aware.  The bulkier forms of larger, more formal tents surround the glade like boughs on a tree, spaced at intervals behind an inner perimeter of wooden barricades."
