      "Smoke almost obscures visibility within an immense cavern, where knobby formations of glaes hulk like sleeping behemoths in the gloom.  Sparks shoot up periodically from pools of glaes at the feet of the outcroppings, lighting the chamber for a moment with their fiery arcs.  Breathing is made painful by the sulfur and heat hanging in the atmosphere."
