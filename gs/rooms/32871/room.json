      "Large panes of thick, cloudy glass enclose this space on three sides and rise above to form a lantern roof.  Within the fourth wall, a wrought iron and glass arch is set directly across from a stained glass door leading out to the garden.  The lush foliage of highly cultivated trees in oversized weathered stone planters forms a thick canopy, their green leaves shading small groupings of white wicker chairs and tables arranged around a cast iron potbelly stove."
