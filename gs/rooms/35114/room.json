      "Dangling from the exposed rafter ceiling, a candelabra of heavy paddle-shaped antlers supports dozens of half-melted candles that provide a soft illumination to the dingy tavern.  Rough benches and stools crowd the space, leaving barely enough room to sidle up to the dark pine and oak bar.  Dingy windows gaze out upon the street, their dirty panes limned in frost, causing it to be impossible to see through them."
