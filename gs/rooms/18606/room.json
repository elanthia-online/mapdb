      "A single candle burns fitfully in the corner of the room furthest from the door.  The light it sheds is hardly adequate to brighten the room past an eerie glow, leaving the bulk of the area in creeping shadows.  A small sphere hangs from the ceiling, seeming as ominous and foreboding as the moon it represents.  Four black velvet pillows sit in the center of the room."
