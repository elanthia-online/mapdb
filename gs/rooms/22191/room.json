    "description": [
      "The lawn rises and falls in gentle hills, and narrow paths wind around the natural slopes, looping among beds of pink and white carnations, crimson dragonstalks, lush hostas, and fragrant angelica.  Three large fountains adorn the garden:  to the north a Vaalor soldier stands at attention, his sword point down before him; to the south, a wyvern spreads its wings, its maw agape in anger; and centered on the main path, a traditional fountain with six tiers of golden bowls burbles quietly."
