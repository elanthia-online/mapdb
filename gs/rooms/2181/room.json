      "Heavy ash covers the cavern floor and absorbs much of the sound and light here while hot sulfurous air, rushing in from the southwest, accumulates ash and steam as it passes before continuing on towards the southeast.  Dull vibrations shake the walls and occasionally jar loose small stones that thud into the thick ash."
