      "Red marl and travertine form a worn path that stretches from the colonnade into a compact clearing.  To the east and north, laurel bushes press close, their dense foliage forming a natural boundary.  Westward, wooden pens rest against a rough incline of rocky scrubland, their canvas-covered shelters offering shade along the edges.  A narrow dirt track winds south, disappearing between the trees, while to the east, marble steps rise toward the colonnade, where white pillars frame the open-air expanse beyond."
