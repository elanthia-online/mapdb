      "Two great pilings stand at the end of the pier.  Each is deeply engraved with ornate briars, the work done by a master's hand.  Salt has caked the recesses and glints brightly where there ought to be shadows in the carvings.",
      "Clad heavily in hardy barnacles, black and rotting struts support the portmost of the docks' three tines as it stretches out into the water.  Droppings spatter the walkway, white against the grey and black of the wood, but not a gull's cry stirs the air.  The waters near the dock are shallow and grant glimpses of bright blue crabs scuttling around on the seafloor."
