      "The tops of large large wooden casks line the back wall, the bodies of the casks imbedded in the wall and the bulk of the containers perhaps sticking out in some room behind.  Only the tops are visible here.  Smaller containers sit neatly stacked on the floor in front of the barrel-lined wall, and the odor of cooking herbs pervades the small shop.  A long stone counter traverses the shop from wall to wall, separating the medicinal area from the customer area."
