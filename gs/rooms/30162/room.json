      "Long, whitewashed posts rise from the hard-packed dirt threshing floor towards a ceiling comprised of polished haon boards, which are supported by smooth wind braces at each joint.  Culminating in larger, white birch doors with oversized wrought iron fixtures, the expanse is spacious with plenty of movement space despite the stacks of hay and bundles of bedding.  Sunlight streams in through the iron grating above an amethyst stall door, its golden flecks dancing upon the neighboring storage chest."
