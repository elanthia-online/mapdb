      "Gazing out onto sweeping verandas, the wide floor-to-ceiling windows of the hallway are covered in rainbow-whorled glass that subtly warps the view beyond.  Surrounding tobacco wood walls are washed in monochromatic hues as moonlight slips through the windows to paint them with an ethereal touch.  The quiet murmur of guests enjoying a meal spills out of a pair of white shutter doors."
