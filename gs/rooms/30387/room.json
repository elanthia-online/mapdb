      "Dense vegetation grows along the water's edge, making travel to the island's interior impossible.  Various trees and shrubs line the shore draped in a canopy of vine and moss.  Bushes decorated with bright flowers cover the area with their thick perfume.  Small monkeys sit high in the branches, chattering among themselves."
