      "Pulsing with a steady, resonant hum, a glowing amber barrier of energy spans a wide crevice at the end of the tunnel.  Though not quite as bright as daylight, the radiance casts back the heavy darkness of the subterranean path and colludes with the towering stalagmites to cast long shadows over the rugged cave floor.  Airy sigils with wild flourishes are etched into the rock walls around the barrier, holding wells of faint light that throb in time with its rhythm."
