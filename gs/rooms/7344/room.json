      "Silence rings heavily in your ears, as even the thorny tangles evident elsewhere avoid this area.  Protruding from the black sludge, masquerading as a stream, are the remnants of a wooden footbridge.  The stream bank dips down here, scooping up a trail that begins where the footbridge was swallowed by the murk."
