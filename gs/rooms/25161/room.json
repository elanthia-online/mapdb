      "Perched on low brass pedestals are nests of alabaster eggs, smooth and unblemished.  The gem-inlaid floor embellishments twine around the platform's base and then continue along to the next, connecting each with a flexuous bridge of fire opal poppies.  Wind hisses over the tiled stones of the yard, the pitch low and angry."
