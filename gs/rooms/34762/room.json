    "description": [
      "A two-headed serpent of violet and scarlet stone strains across the walls of the sanctum, a blood-drenched figure with scales on his face caught amidst its powerful coils.  Before him stands an altar carved from a single piece of bloodstone.  Fountains to either side spray blood into basins of marble, the crimson flow stark against the pale stone.  Candles burning in huddled groups around the chamber's perimeter light the room, but cannot excise the scent of copper from the air."
