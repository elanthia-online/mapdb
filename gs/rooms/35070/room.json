      "Comprised of squat, dark stones, the walls of the shop are carved with numerous symbols around idol-filled niches.  Several dusty, curtained windows let in dim light, each lined with brightly colored potion bottles, and dozens of vials, crystals, and other alchemical accoutrements are haphazardly arranged along wooden counters and shelves."
