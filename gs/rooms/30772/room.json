      "Elevated, silver-grey stone walls encompass the spacious parlor, rising all the way up to an oak-beamed, vaulted ceiling.  Rainbow glaes panels hang from corner to corner on the back wall, the rich colors highlighting a veniom-inset glass case situated near a burnished vultite display plaque.  The heart of the room holds a tufted dark leather couch that rests before a wide-mantled pale limestone hearth adjacent to a pair of tall marble double doors."
