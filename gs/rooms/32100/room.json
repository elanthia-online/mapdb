      "Acrid and nostril-burning, the overpowering aroma of preservative suffuses the stale air in the cramped room.  Condensation drips down the limestone walls, guided by cracks and streaks of black mold.  Old chairs are heaped into the corners, wood frames splintered and askew, though a few have been pulled out of the piles.  Laden with bug-pinned boards and open jars, a work table stands against the wall opposite a fractured ogee arch."
