      "The remnants of small campfires dot the cool, moist sand shadowed and shaded by the pier directly overhead.  Thin beams of golden sunlight dance across the pebbled soil, filtering through cracks in the boards above.  Massive weathered oak pilings support the walkway overhead and provide cover for hunters attempting to ambush unsuspecting prey."
