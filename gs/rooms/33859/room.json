      "The ivy-entwined lamp posts frame either side of the ebony-planked boardwalk, the faenor-forged poles affixed with spherical lanterns of gilded glass.  A series of haon-framed maps are hung between the posts, the ivory-colored vellum filled with vivid inks and sooty charcoal, each depicting a rendition of the port and the water surrounding it.  Set below the artistic renditions is a rectangular ebony planter, the flora and foliage spilling over the scalloped edges in shades of burgundy and plum."
