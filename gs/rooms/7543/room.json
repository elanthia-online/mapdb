      "Dirt and rock, held together by stout, ancient tree roots, are all that is left of the walls here.  An old cave-in reduced the original tunnel to a mass of jumbled rubble beneath you.  Mud and loose stones line the sides of the passage, and the earthen roof is just high enough for you to stand up.  A thin trickle of glassy water flows eastward and down the rubble pile, from a large chamber just to the north."
