      "This alley spans the short distance between the eastern wall and the riverbank.  The blank back walls of the alchemist's house and the cooper's shop provide an unremarkable view.  Wharf rats scurry among at the debris in the lane, scampering into the shadows only when it becomes clear to them that their tails are in imminent danger of being trampled.",

Several gulls peck at the debris in the lane, taking flight only when it becomes clear to them that their tailfeathers are in imminent danger of being trampled."
