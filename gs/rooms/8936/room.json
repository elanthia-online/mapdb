      "Jutting out into the open air within the core of the tower, this promontory affords an unmatchable vantage point for observing the ever-raging lightstorm.  The violent lightning strikes, eye-searing both in their brightness and in their virulent hues, arc off the zorchar rod rising through the center of the tower but avoid hitting this balcony, leaving it untouched.  A well-stocked bookcase partially blocks the outer walkway, its studious contents at odds with the wildness of the lightstorm."
