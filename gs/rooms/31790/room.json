      "Heavy stones form the walkway across a large fortress, the parapet stretching east and west leading down to the battlements and several small tents providing makeshift shelter.  Beyond the gates are untethered marionettes, their peeled and cracked visages gazing towards the entrance, shuffling forward as they drag their strings in the trampled grass.  Wooden toy swords lay buried within the muddied puddles, splattered with bright crimson paint that bleeds into the soil."
