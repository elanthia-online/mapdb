      "Surrounded by bright tropical blossoms, a long wooden dock stretches out into the cool waters of the harbor and provides access to a small island.  Tall pylons surround the wooden structure, while bright white buoys line its edges and lightly bounce beneath the insistent push of the rolling waves."
