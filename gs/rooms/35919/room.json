      "A cluster of sugar maples, white ash, and birch trees draped in fiery orange and yellow-gold raiment are artfully posed amid the more darkly crowned, red-violet sweetgum trees along the path's edge, providing a vibrant overhang to a painted tin-roofed stall.  Swags of plum-hued gauze festoon the edge of the roof, tacked in place with posies of folded corn husks, dark berries, and acorn clusters."
