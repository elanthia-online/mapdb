      "Curtains of vert heartleaf drape across the sun-bleached limestone buildings, entwining across the wrought iron balconies as they brush against the cobblestones.  Naefira-framed doorways of shuttered wood are interspersed between the fern-planted clay pots, the vessels framing each shallow step across the walkway.  Entwined within a circular patch of rich earth is a pair of silvery-leafed olive trees, the dense branches draped over a narrow stone bench inset in tiles of sea glass."
