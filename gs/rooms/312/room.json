      "Time and tide have not been kind to the dilapidated shacks along this dreary stretch of riverfront beach.  The rotted and weatherbeaten planks, the patched roofs and the mud lanes cast a melancholy pall of neglect here, in contrast to the lively sounds of the river, drifting over from the dark shore that lies directly to the east.  To the north, occasional sounds of sawing and banging emanate from the boatyard.",
