      "Steeply inclined, the winding trail departs from the knee-high, yellowish green ryegrasses along the western edge to a barren stretch of land dimpled by moonlight white boulders.  Standing stones painted in splatters of verdigris-hued lichen cast fingers of shadows along the southeastern edge of the track, sentinels or heralds to the burial cairn beyond it.  Forgotten by its steward, a double handle of an ard, its plough-head buried in the earth, houses the tattered remains of cloak or shawl."
