      "Overlapping one another, bright red triangles of canvas provide shelter to the wedge-shaped pen that is filled with blue-green grass and grazing sheep and goats.  White picket fencing keeps the ovine denizens from wandering away, while baskets of sweet grass hold their attention.  Bells strung from green and yellow ribbons mark the entry gate, which leads back to the central viewing area of the glade."
