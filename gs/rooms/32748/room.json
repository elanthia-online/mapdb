      "This room is tastefully decorated in muted autumnal colors.  A rust-colored carpet patterned with golden sailing ships covers the floor, accentuating the golden curtains and soft brown walls.  The large four-post bed features oversized golden pillows above an elaborately embroidered comforter.  An elegant crystal vase on each night table holds a small bouquet of chrysanthemums."
