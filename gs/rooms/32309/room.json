    "description": [
      "A shallow, rock-strewn fork of the Olbin cuts through the roadway, whispering through the high red and green grasses clinging to the banks.  A bridge of stone, sharp edges worn down by long years of hard wind and snowfall, spans the river.  Grotesques are perched along its rooftop, but the same wear has dwindled them down to mere suggestions of figures that have more in common with melted candles than statues."
