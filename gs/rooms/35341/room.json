      "Set apart from the main room, the enclosed chamber is softly illuminated by hanging lamps, their warm glow casting gentle shadows across the walls.  Long wooden tables stretch in neat rows, each carefully arranged with items for resale.  Glass-shielded shelves along the walls hold several trinkets and curios on display that are not for sale, while overlapping braided rugs underfoot muffle sound."
