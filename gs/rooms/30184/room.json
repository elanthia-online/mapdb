      "Nestled between a gold mahogany bench on either side, a gold mahogany table fills most of the space in the hall.  In one corner, a rocking chair has been haphazardly fashioned from wine barrel staves and its seat occupied by a one-eyed, scruffy ships cat.  Empty platters and dry cups are laid out on the tabletop awaiting the next meal."
