      "Residing in the middle of the dirt road, a massive mud hole prevents easy passage through the area, though small patches of grass along one edge of the road allow for a dry method of navigating the slick, dirty mess.  The mud pools just slightly into the rhubarb fields, but it seems to dry up just a few paces in."
