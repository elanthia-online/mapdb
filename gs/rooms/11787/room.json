      "The tall hill that these homes have been constructed upon is providing the residents with an excellent view of the entire marsh below.  The pathway forks in several directions and the southern trail has been reinforced to provide safe passage towards what appears to be an arena.  A wide trellis has been built along the side of this road, and tiny red flowers dot its entire length quite prettily."
