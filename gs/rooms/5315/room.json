      "A pine with a trunk half again too large for a giantman to put his arms around reaches toward the sky, as if to single-handedly guard the ground from the touch of the sun.  Streamers of moss grow from the craggy bark, decorating it like a shaggy, musty maypole that was left out of doors for a century.  Sharp-thorned bushes grow close about it, trying but not succeeding in strangling the life from the giant arbole."
