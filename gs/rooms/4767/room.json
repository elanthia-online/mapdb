      "Ancient black oaks rise up from the leafy earth, shadowing the crumbled remains of the cobbled road.  Spotted in places with patches of dark green moss and lighter tones of lichen, the wrinkled bark of the old trees seems well-suited to repelling the ravages of time and weather.  Underfoot, the crackle of dead leaves keeps time with each footstep.",
