      "The crowds attenuate near the northern boundary of the town, reduced to a few clerics headed east into the Temple Burrow and several stalwarts bound toward the northern gates.  Most everyone on the road wears thick boots and fur-lined cloaks, though a sprinkling of krolvin wear lighter clothing of hide with accoutrements of whalebone and sharktooth.   The glacier overshadows the roadway, its severe wall rising high above the streets, and the cobblestones are slippery with ice and tracked-in snow.",
      "This part of the road is on the very edge of the glacier.  The cobbles are slippery with ice and tracked-in snow, and most everyone on the road is wearing thick boots and fur-lined cloaks.  To the north you can see a group of guards around a hole in the wall of ice, presumably guarding the entrance to the town."
