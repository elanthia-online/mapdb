      "The cobblestone paths leading from the north and south come together here, forming one path to the west.  Set near the center of the two paths is an ethereal lamp hung from a long iron post, offering heatless light.  Below, errant pieces of straw line the sides of the path, accompanied by small brown apple-shaped objects."
