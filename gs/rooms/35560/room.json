      "Opening into a more spacious cavern, the reef curves protectively overhead.  The walls are draped in layered nets, each strung with bundles of swaying plant life.  Low stone benches jut from the coral, their surfaces scattered with beads, polished shells, and coils of ribbon.  At the center, a driftwood worktable rimmed in pearls holds half-finished garlands and intricately woven strands.  From above, lengths of translucent seaweed dangle like living curtains, swaying gently with the shifting currents."
