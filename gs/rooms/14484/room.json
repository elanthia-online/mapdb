      "A few short, wide stairs lead down into a wide, circular room.  A wide walkway runs along the perimeter of the area, leading visitors around a massive underwater-themed mural.  Large signs and plaques are imbedded into the walls in various places, offering informative additions to the art.  Two ramps curve off in opposite directions to the south of the room, leading further into the building."
