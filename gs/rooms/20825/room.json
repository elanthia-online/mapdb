      "This suite is decorated completely in pure white.  The floor is strewn invitingly with large soft white pillows covered with fresh blood red rose petals -- the scent of roses is intoxicating.  In the center, a large circular white marble hearth stands burning merrily.  The light from the fire turns everything in the room into a pure flaming red."
