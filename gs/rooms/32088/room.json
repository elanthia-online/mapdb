      "Centered at the rear of the study is a massive black marble fireplace with a basket of sticks sitting on the edge of the hearth, while the space to either side is occupied with wall-to-wall bookcases.  The remainder of the wall space is covered with dark crimson wallpaper embossed with a tone-on-tone floral pattern and a street-facing window heavily curtained with black velvet.  Opposite the arch out is a thin scarlet-striped black velvet couch with an attached chaise, with a few wing-backed black velvet chairs spread out before it.  Amid the seating is stationed a tiered silver-framed refreshment cart with a variety of glasses on the lower shelf."
