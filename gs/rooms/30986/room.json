      "Gold latticework lined with silver rope rings the sandstone walls of the small studio.  Opposite an iron-wrought spiral staircase, a small window opens out over the courtyard letting the salted exterior air mix with the scent of mulberry and jasmine incense.  To the side, a juniper display case with a polished teak counter stands below a small white marble shelf.  A large oil painting, flanked by two brass lanterns, occupies the otherwise barren wall across from the workstation."
