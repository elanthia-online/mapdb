      "Lambent eyes glare down upon the entryway of the temple, the twin shards of chatoyant golden stone set into the mask of a carved sandstone panther head adorning the opposing wall.  Other felines are depicted in mosaic tiles spreading across the floor of the entry, blood amber and obsidian tesserae giving shape to lions, lynxes, and caracals.  The hall bends into a sharp crescent as it continues to the northwest and northeast, while due north, an arch carved with leaping cats leads toward the central altar."
