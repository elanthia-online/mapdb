      "Mold has overwhelmed the straw of the stables, pervading the air with a stale funk that smells like the work of long years of decay.  Once, the stable would have comfortably housed several dozen horses, judging from the stalls proceeding into the unlit dimness.  The building is still and quiet, and now it houses only unsettling creaks and groans."
