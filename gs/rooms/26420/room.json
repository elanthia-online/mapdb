    "description": [
      "Warped oak boards are fitted tightly together to form the walls of the shack, while the smooth floorboards are fashioned of teak and roughened up to prevent slipping.  Glass-fronted lanterns with rusted iron doors are suspended in the rafters of the low ceiling and provide illumination for the rack and counter that display a variety of fishing wares.  A painted sign displaying a cavern with indigo lights is tacked near the exit."
