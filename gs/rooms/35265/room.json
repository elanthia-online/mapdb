      "Extending into the aquamarine waters, the pier features charcoal grey wooden planks bordered by white travertine columns.  Glass fishing floats hang from the pillars, their surfaces clouded by years of exposure to the sea.  The gentle rocking of the dock creates a soothing rhythm, blending with the soft lapping of waves against the sturdy structure."
