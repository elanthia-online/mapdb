      "The stairs lead up to a spacious room with a pair of splintered doors on the western wall.  Tattered shreds of gossamer drape from the edges of the ceiling, brokenly veiling tilted paintings and a full-length mirror tucked into one corner.  In the center of the room, open manacles hang from the armrests and footrest of a reclined leather chair.  Scattered around a mahogany console table, piles of dusty velvet cushions provide an alternative to the questionable seating."
