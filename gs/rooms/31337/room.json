      "Stone steps lead up into this section of the pavilion and up to a pool of water.  Brightly colored fish of pale orange and silver dash beneath the watery surface when spotted.  Lily pads decorate the pool, some bearing large lilies ranging from pure white to dark shades of pink while others are made of stone and hold up widowwood lanterns.  Near the water's edge is a gnarled tree sprouting up from the lagoon, looming overhead like a contorted figure."
