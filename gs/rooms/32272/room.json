      "A thunderous explosion makes the smaller stones on the ground rattle and skitter, while in the distance, the top of one of the heinous towers is obliterated by a flaming boulder propelled by a particularly powerful gout of flames.  Dust and bone shards rain down in an audible shower that can be heard from half a league away."
