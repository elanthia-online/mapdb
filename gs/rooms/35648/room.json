      "The crystal blue waters of the abounding sea have heaped their tithes upon the sand.  Baubles of gold and silver and copper wink teasingly from the glittering white dunes.  Waterlogged chests and strongboxes lie half-buried in the sand, most with only locks eaten by rust and corrosion to guard their secrets.  By some trick of the tides, the treasures appear to be from places far abroad, none being alike in origin to another."
