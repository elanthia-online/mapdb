      "The hallway here is brightly lit, with oil lamps resting in elaborate pewter sconces along the walls on both sides.  A wooden stage door stands between two sconces leading stage left, while a dressing room door in the opposite wall is clearly marked with a gilded golden star.  At each end of the hallway, a polished oak door leads into the audience chamber."
