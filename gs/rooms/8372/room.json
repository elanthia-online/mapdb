      "The passageway seems to exhale, growing larger and more extensively decorated as it twists up.  A larger chamber is just visible above this one, its perimeters hidden by the curve of the corridor and the gloom.  Light flickers in short bursts in that direction, amplified by the clouds of dust swirling in the shadows."
