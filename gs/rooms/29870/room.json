      "Several timber dwellings encircle a wide, clear space beneath the shadow of an ancient pine tree.  The gentle behemoth scrapes at the sky, its vast boughs gravid with white snow.  Though the barren earth makes for a poor town green, the pine has showered the area beneath it with a thick carpet of needles, both verdant and brown."
