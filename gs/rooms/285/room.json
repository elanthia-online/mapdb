    "description": [
      "Here in the midst of the town stretches the cobblestoned main bazaar, its lamplit lanes abuzz with traders and vendors hawking their wares at any hour of the day or night.  Groups of citizens, discussing the day's events or preparing for nighttime hunts, gather around the doors of the merchants whose shops border the square.  The gilded but peeling stone facade of the First Elanith Bank dominates this side of the square.",
      "Here in the midst of the town stretches the cobblestoned main bazaar, its serpentine lanes abuzz with traders bartering, bickering, and hawking their wares.  The freewheeling vendors in the bazaar provide a lively alternative to the somewhat stodgier merchants whose shops border the square.  The gilded but peeling stone facade of the First Elanith Bank dominates this side of the square."
