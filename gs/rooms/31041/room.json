      "Matching jackets and trousers hang from curved silver hooks, lining the aromatic cedar walls.  Several low tables on either side of a carved arch hold an impressive display of neatly pressed dress shirts in a variety of colors and styles.  Rows of warmly glowing orbs nestle discreetly near the ceiling, offering their bright light to this elegant shop."
