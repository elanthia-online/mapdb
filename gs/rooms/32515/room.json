      "Heavy brocade curtains partially cover a row of thick glass windows that overlook the atrium down below.  A curved maoral desk and chair sit in one corner, bordered by two oversized rune-etched armoires.  A plush red bear skin rug dominates the center of the floor and stretches beneath a massive lion's head mounted on the wall."
