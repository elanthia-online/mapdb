      "Glistening wetly, pale sediment collects at the lip of a ragged tear along the tunnel wall.  The thrum and roar of an underground watercourse booms and echoes from beyond the breach.  Rough striations of cloudy bluerock mottle the claw-riven stone, their sparkle muted by the heaviness of the misted air."
