      "Twisted poles of aged pewter form the silk-curtained frame of the bed, the richly embroidered comforter spilling down upon the wood-planked floor.  Sunlight pours in through the tall stained glass window, highlighting the pillow-filled nook and intricate dollhouse displayed on a scorched wooden side table, the panes staining the area in vibrant crimson.  An etched mirror sits above a porcelain basin on the opposite side of the room, the bowl flanked by twin vases filled with dark-petaled flora."
