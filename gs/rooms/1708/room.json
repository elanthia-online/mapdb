      "Red and white bolts of silk hang in alternating columns around the periphery of this enormous sanctuary.  Skeletons lie in four rows on either side of a marbled aisle leading to a large dais centered on the northern wall.  Upon the dais is a simple golden altar supporting a small ceremonial dagger stand."
