      "Cinnamon-colored bark describes a path through the dense arbor.  Mangosteen trees, small in stature, give way to their taller banana and mango brethren.  Several stands of ferns grow in their shady boughs, while a flock of birds-of-paradise have lighted on the single sunny patch in the area.",
