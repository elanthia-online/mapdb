    "description": [
      "Pocked and pitted from the brine in the air, the Salt Gate is a lofty confection of stout metal set into the face of the city's northern wall.  Suckered tentacles of verdigris copper twine around the steel bars, which are fashioned with ornamental barnacles spiraling down their length.  Beyond, snatches of verdant green woodland and white-capped hills beckon.  A vast procession of black steps, worn smooth by time and the passage of many travelers, descends from the plateau toward the untamed wild."
