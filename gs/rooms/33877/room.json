      "Hemp-strung lanterns are draped across the sun-washed stucco buildings, the graduated vellum spheres suspended above the grey-toned cobblestones.  Whimsical displays of lacquered instruments and folios of sheet music stand behind the naefira-painted panes of glass, the individual shops decorating their entryways in fragrant garlands of florals.  The faint sounds of singing echo from the rooftop gardens above the road, the voices accompanied by both harp and lute."
