      "A tall rookery, crooked and black, leans perilously over the roadside, casting a dread shadow across the smooth-worn cobbles.  It rises far above the thick green canopy of the encroaching trees and a story higher than most of the manses lurking beyond the greenery.  The outer sills of the rookery's cavernous windows are stained white with the leavings of countless birds."
