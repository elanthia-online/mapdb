      "The boxwoods continue their enigmatic path, blocking any view of what lies ahead.  Somewhere within the foliage, a pair of squirrels chitter angrily, as though they too cannot decide which path to take.  Along the ground, sunlight touches the glossy leaves of a creeping periwinkle, its purple flowers adding color within the greenery."
