      "The darkly stained, white oak flooring of this bedroom is relieved by the white shiplap walls and exposed beam ceiling of this inviting room.  Atop a tonal blue wool rug, which covers most of the floor, rests a large feather-stuffed bed and a footbench with a rope-hung brass chandelier suspended overhead.  On the opposite wall, a small antique dresser sits between two diamond-grid windows with a polished silver mirror hung above it."
