      "A pair of metal sconces stand guard over a battered wooden door, each intricately made to resemble the open maw of a drake.  Red carpet has been placed on the floor leading both northwest and northeast, however at each end, the carpet has been torn to shreds.  A large granite plaque hangs on the wall across from the door."
