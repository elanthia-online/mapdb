      "The sound of crackling energy emanates from the column of cobalt energy, its colorful essence turning in upon itself and pulsating with power.  The air in the room is heavy, with a faint scent of burnt iron.  The smooth surface of the tower's dark stone walls gleams as dim light illuminates its surface.  A velvet-curtained arch dominates the far wall opposite a grim mosaic crafted from colored rock."
