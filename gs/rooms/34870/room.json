      "Large, black obstacles litter the ground here, obscuring the path both ahead and behind.  Varying in size from a large rock to a small boulder, each rounded black object seems to have dropped from the underside of the enormous green fronds overhead.  Their surprisingly squishy surfaces give a brief, springy lift to those brave enough to climb atop and jump from one to another.  One of the larger round objects seems to have narrowly missed landing on a wax-dotted white birch crate."
