      "A rotund little shop nestled at the end of the rows of trees is strung with strands of diamond-shaped paper lanterns, each tiny flame within illuminating the dyed vellum to cast off shades of crimson, russet, and yellow-gold.  A few scattered wooden chairs sit around small tables beneath the lanterns, with a coppery spigotted urn on a stand arranged with clear glass mugs near the shop's door.  There's a paper note affixed to the urn."
