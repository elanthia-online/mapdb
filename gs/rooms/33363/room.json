      "Quarantined from the chaos of the adjacent chamber, sizable throws of snow leopard fur line both the floor and walls, meticulously aligned to create a hypnotizing pattern of dark spots.  Stone pedestals inlaid with ur-barath sconces bear candles that release a gentle, soothing fragrance into the air, erasing all evidence of the musty scent in neighboring areas.  White fur rugs form a circle inside the pedestal boundary, each one spaced far enough from the next to allow for adequate distancing."
