      "A round mithril-framed window hangs on one of the varnished ebonwood walls, and an ebonwood beam ceiling rises overhead.  A scaled model of Hearthstone sits in one corner of a dark-stained oak floor.  There is some mithril-braced shelves on one side of the shop.",
      "Below a vaulted stone ceiling, a gargantuan stone desk takes up the majority of a hewn stone floor, displaying some of the items for sale here.  Behind it, an official looking plaque is attached to one of the smooth rock walls.  In the corner, a rearing armored fly sculpture seemingly stands guard over a veniom-bound mithril chest, which acts as a secondary display for wares."
