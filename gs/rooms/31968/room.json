      "Cozy and tiny, the structure appears to be part shop and part workshop.  Brightly lit copper lanterns line the northern wall providing illumination for a long workbench covered in hand drills, screwdrivers, planers, and sandpaper, the telltale signs of a wood carver littering the floor in the form of curls of wood and sawdust.  Conversely, there seems to be an invisible line where the wood shop ends and a pristine shop begins.  A cloth-covered low display table and a wide wicker hamper of wares rest upon a small rug."
