      "Travelers crowd the road, making it difficult to traverse without the occasional bump or jostle.  They crowd the entrance of a small fired brick building, an obstacle to the message runners in the deep blue elk hides commonly worn by local couriers.  Wagons drawn by surly mules struggle to make their way toward the town's central square in the east, completely stymied by the foot traffic.",
      "Travellers go by at a dizzying pace.  It is difficult to walk by without running into one of them.  Walking sideways seems to be the only way to make any progress down the road."
