    "description": [
      "Rotten wooden walls surround this dusty space.  Thick layers of cobwebs coat the windows and two hanging lanterns, dampening the light cast by each.  A series of shelves adorn the walls, their contents glittering dully in what little light comes through the dust and grime.  Tilted off its hinges, a black door leads into another room, though the view through the gaps affords only darkness.  The doorway to the porch remains open to the elements, and stray gusts of wind carry with them the stench of the swamp."
