      "What might have been the top of the tower is no longer anything but a bone-covered platform with no walls.  Something so violent erupted here as to completely destroy this entire level.  Faintly visible on the floor is a broken star circle.  The floor is in ruins and one wrong step over what remains will cause a fatal fall."
