      "Large and acoustically well proportioned, the stage opens expectantly to the auditorium -- lights and curtain, tabs and borders, all are cleverly placed to entice the audience's eye.  A semitransparent scrim hangs at the back from the grid of metal framework above.  A wide apron at the front of the stage completes the space, from which every seat in the house can be seen."
