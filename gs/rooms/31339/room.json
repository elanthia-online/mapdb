      "From here, the eye is drawn to a particularly ornate tombstone in the second row from the path.  It is nearly twice the size of the others surrounding it, and its surface is carved with dozens of evenly spaced sigils.  This tombstone is the only one with offerings laid before it, and amongst them is a wide, flickering candle with a large glass shield to protect it from the elements."
