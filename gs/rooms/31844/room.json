      "The silent woodland beyond the channel is covered with a thick carpet of blackish green moss covering nearly every visible inch of ground.  Magnificent trees, their branches uniting to form a dense canopy of foliage, shut out the sky above.  As the slate-colored river winds through the timbered landscape, a mist settles over the water obscuring the course ahead."
