      "A variety of scents waft throughout the room, a mixture of jasmine, lavender, and vanilla incense burning in brass sconces scattered throughout the space.  A polished cabinet made of maoral stands adjacent to a three-legged granite table that has several lamps atop it.  Flickering in the lantern light, small wisps of ecru smoke tease the dried herbs that hang from the rafters."
