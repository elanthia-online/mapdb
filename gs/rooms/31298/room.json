      "The trees in this area are widely spaced, allowing for plenty of free movement amongst them.  There is a path running east to west, lined with felled trees to give it a rough sense of order.  Here and there, various stalls have been set up amongst the trees to either side of the path, and a quiet buzz of muted conversation drifts by on a slight breeze."
