      "A precise, symmetrically cut, rectangular rhimar slab is centered in this corner of the hovel, with just enough space for a thin uneven shelf along the curved wall furthest from the hovel's workshop.  Gusts of heat waft in from the east, where a large kiln is shrouded in a haze of pale grey smoke."
