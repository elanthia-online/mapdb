      "Near the top of the foremast, a basket has been mounted between the topgallant sail and the fore topsail which serves as the chief observation post onboard.  Outfitted with a swivel-mounted spyglass on the brass railing, theres only room for one lookout.  Rope ladders lead through a hatch in the floor back down to the main deck."
