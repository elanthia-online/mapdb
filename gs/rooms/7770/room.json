      "Several of the large trees that stand sentinel over this area have been badly bashed and battered by a blunt object swung or thrown with immense force.  Scores of smaller trees and bushes have been uprooted and now lie dead upon the ground.  Even the rocks of the area appear to have been hurled about like the toys of a child."
