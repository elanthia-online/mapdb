      "Crowded by a low ceiling, the ragged walls of the passage continue to wind their way through the permanent, dead-of-night darkness several leagues below the mountains.  A large crevice allows access to another section of tunnels below.  Something rotten fills the air but cannot be seen in the immediate area."
