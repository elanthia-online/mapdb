      "Narrow and straight, the trail cuts through the center of a monumental fairy ring created by fly agaric.  Pleated parasol mushrooms spread across the clearing like blanched grass, dwarfed by the sky-high circle and surrounding forest.  The fungal field luminesces in rippling waves, the rhythmic ebb and flow reminiscent of moonlit waves rolling through a vast ocean."
