    "description": [
      "Warm and spacious, the lounge offers a cozy retreat with a rich mahogany floor and a high-vaulted ceiling framed by honey oak walls.  A grand fireplace stands against the western wall, and moonlight streams into the room through a pair of wide arched windows that flank its chimney.  A small basket of sticks sits by the fireplace.  Oversized couches and roomy chairs are casually scattered about the room, providing plenty of comfortable seats, and a curved mistwood bar stretches out beneath the loft."
