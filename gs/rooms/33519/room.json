      "Bright light gives the tiny shop an airy feel and almost washes out the pale green and pastel pink stripes running vertically down the walls.  Plain molding rings the perimeter where the raftered ceiling meets the octagonal configuration of the small building, and translucent white gossamer curtains flutter with the soft breeze from the open windows and ajar doorway.  A hodgepodge of ceramic pots in bright hues hold miniature rose bushes in splendid bloom that line every sill."
