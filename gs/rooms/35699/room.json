    "description": [
      "Jagged rocks descend sharply toward a green path a staggering drop below, their surfaces etched into strange patterns by wind and driving rain.  Sparse vegetation struggles between cracks, manifesting as spiky grasses sprouting from a shallow crevice or hardy shrubs along the cliff's edge.  The roots of the latter protrude defiantly from the rock face, gripping tenuously to stony hollows.  Soft breezes whisper through narrow fissures in the rock, filling the air with strange, moaning music."
