      "Scents of exotic spice and strange incense are heavy on the air of the capacious foyer, the walls of which are lined with leather-upholstered benches graced by carved bone buttons.  The seats look upon a monumental statue of lightly verdigrised bronze depicting a hand holding scales aloft, one side weighed down by a pile of coin.  Pennants from several dozen different ships, comprising a variety of shapes and clashing colors, hang from the ceiling, wafting toward a mosaic arch in the northern wall."
