      "Rose-hued sandstone clads the facade of an elegant shop, the blocks fitted so tightly together that the seams are nearly invisible.  Cascades of pale pink roses drift in fragrant clouds from a trellis surrounding the shop's front door.  A small silver sign is tacked to the doorpost.",
      "Wisps of acrid smoke emanate from a rose-hued sandstone shop, which has been reduced to a pile of rubble.  Oddly, a wooden trellis has survived the destruction and stands tall amid the ruins.  Unfortunately, the rose vines winding around and through the trellis have not done as well, but instead are scorched and withered.",
      "A polished limestone structure hugs the wey, surrounded by neatly trimmed box hedges.  Creeper vines stretch up the walls of the building, and a small silver sign is affixed near the door.  A pair of guards patrol the area, squinting into the darkness with torches held high.",
      "A polished limestone structure hugs the wey, surrounded by neatly trimmed box hedges.  Creeper vines stretch up the walls of the building, and a small silver sign is affixed near the door.  An elven clerk stands on the front steps, crying his wares."
