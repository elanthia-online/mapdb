    "description": [
      "This vine-roofed hut serves as both a manufactory of glass as well as a shop offering its creations.  Beside a cold and ash-stained iron furnace, a sprawling workbench displays myriad metal tools of glassmaking, while along the riverstone walls, a painted tanik shelf and a smooth oak shelf flaunt a smattering of colorful glass trinkets for sale.  Beside a roughly hewn oak log pedestal, a neatly inked notice and a small placard call for the attention of all patrons."
