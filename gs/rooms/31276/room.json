      "Drab beige canvas encloses the sparsely furnished space, lit by the silvery moonlight streaming through the open tent flap.  Against the back wall, some tall standing shelves display neatly organized shipping supplies.  A worn sailcloth bin, tucked beneath a long oak table, frays along the rim where heavy use has loosened the threads stitching the fabric around a wiry metal frame."
