      "Artwork decorates the whitewashed walls, each guarded by gilt stanchions with cobalt velvet ropes, while several displays are strategically spaced around the rotunda.  Low beechwood wainscotting meets recessed exits scattered around the area, each leading in a different direction.  Sunlight casts a warm glow upon a three-tiered silvery marble fountain with cardinal-facing features that dominates the otherwise rounded room."
