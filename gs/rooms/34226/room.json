    "description": [
      "Silken tendrils, thick and viscid, droop in tangles from the uneven ceiling of the narrow corridor.  The walls have been scratched and scraped, leaving behind runnels spotted with dried blood, and a faint iron tang intrudes upon the pervasive stench of vinegar.  Crystals grow from the cragged floor, lighting the path in smooth waves that pulse from one cluster to the next in rhythmic procession."
