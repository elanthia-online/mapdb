      "The tall metal-framed windows enclosing the room have been boarded shut, the iron nails sticking out in irregular angles to create makeshift hooks.  Heavy, hole-ridden sheets of green velvet loosely cover a series of pristine wooden crates, the fabric pooling across the knitted rugs covering the dusty planks.  A pair of driftwood-carved sculptures flank a gilt-painted curio in the far corner, the open doors draped in a fine layer of brittle cobwebs."
