      "A sprawling building built of rough-cut logs, chinked with mud, and roofed with red tiles stands half-buried beneath the ground here.  The peak of the roof rises to waist level, and a wide timber stairway set into the turf descends to an equally wide doorway.  A wooden sign depicting a cluster of barrels, crates, and grainsacks hangs above the door."
