      "There is no question that the tacky substance on the stone floor was once a pool of blood, based purely on its coloring and the vile scent released when disturbed.  Across the breach, a pair of statues stare at each other -- one with heavily veined wings stretched wide and curled fists raised into the air, while the other is engaged in ripping an imp in half, entrails and viscera strung out in stone between the parts."
