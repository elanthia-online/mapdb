      "Multicolored silk with a texture like flowing water enshrouds a small space broken by a widowwood display case.  Suspended from the tent supports above, small pierced silver spheres hold beeswax votives that cast the surroundings in a hazy incandescence.  A circular Tehir rug, bright with bandings of red and gold and green, cushions the ground.  There are bright-colored pillows scattered about the edges of a small nook formed by a bend in the tent's fabric."
