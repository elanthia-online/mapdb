      "What once was thick forest is now a barren expanse of stumps and broken trees.  To the west, the road pierces the seemingly impenetrable leafy vastness of Greymist Wood.  Even in the mud, so recently trodden by logger's boots, life flourishes.  A family of oddly colorful toads croaks happily in a small pond formed by rain collected in a dip in the road."
