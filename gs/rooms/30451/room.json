      "Shoals of mackerel tumble through and above the water, their silver bodies breaching the water in small cascades.  Groups merge, break apart, and go through each other in what looks to be a random manner, yet the sizes of the shoals never seem to change.  Despite the shadows of night that darken the water, the scales of the silvery fish seem to catch any available moonlight."
