      "Strewn with small cuttings of green, the small path is otherwise dusty and filled with small ruts.  A small wheelbarrow stands off to the side of the path, its front wheel leaning up against one an usually short artichoke plant's stalk.  Beyond the contraption, dozens of other artichoke plants, which have been relieved of their heads, block any view of the horizon."
