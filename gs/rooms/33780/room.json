      "Beyond the stretch of rock and blood, the land turns verdant and lush, with entire swathes of vibrant green grass leading in all directions.  To the east, the plump forms of mountain roltons graze in fenced meadows, and to the west, the land is dotted with several farms.  To the north stands a wide gathering of stone walls and buildings, bathed in the sunlight from the open sky high above."
