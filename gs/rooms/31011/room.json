    "description": [
      "Like pennants from a washer woman's nightmare, swathes of fabric in various stages of dying dangle from the rafters in a pageantry of mismatched colors.  Dye splatters mark every surface, including the white shelves that hold vials of dye and the short display counters filled with gnomish contraptions.  A curved umbrella shields the area where an attendant stands next to a parchment-filled hexagonal cubby."
