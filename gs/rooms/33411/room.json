      "Cutting a path through the high grass of the surrounding dunes, a smooth boardwalk rests upon glittering white sands to create an even egress that follows the rapidly shortening granite wall to its southeast.  Brightly burning torches mark the ends of pebble and seashell walkways that depart from the boardwalk and end at the colorful doors of the small domiciles that are built between the nearby dunes and their sandy game trails.  Trailing over the granite cliff face, fuchsia and white blossom-laden bower vines perfume the air."
