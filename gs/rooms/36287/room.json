      "Carved into the oak panels of the far wall, a graceful tree of life spreads its branches.  Polished stone familiars are evenly spaced around the room.  Perched on rounded pedestals, they stand sentinel over small tables holding carefully placed historical artifacts. To the east of the entry, three paintings in gilded frames and an incongruous boar's head hang above the familiars.  To the west, the curved wall bears two plaques, one silver plaque and one gold plaque, hung side by side on the smooth oak paneling."
