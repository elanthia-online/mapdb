      "Although this particular trail comes to an abrupt end, further ahead is a treacherous path that careens down the western side of the Dragonspine.  Crumbling into ruin, the track is time-worn and long abandoned.  At the bottom, a vast forest of aspens spreads forth to the west, while the upper portion of the path vanishes into a snow-laden pass."
