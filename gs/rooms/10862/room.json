      "Curving gently from the southeast to the southwest, the roadway flows with a river of small stones in varying hues of grey.  As a creek feeds a river, a riverstone walkway merges with the road, snaking smoothly from between two evergreen hedges which border the main roads to the south.  A narrow, moss-covered trail is just visible in the heavily wooded area opposite the hedges and channels the faint sound of a song to the ears of those that walk here."
