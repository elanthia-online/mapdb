      "Kapok trees rise overhead, a dense canopy spreading out from the thick, sturdy trunks.  A wrought iron gate, thickly overgrown with climbing roses, marks the start of a stone-lined walkway.  Curving through clusters of plumeria and orchids, a pale path of seashells joins a sandy path that winds downward toward a wooden dock.  Ferns and philodendrons press along the edges, their greenery filling the spaces between the blossoming growth."
