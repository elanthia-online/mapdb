      "Pale mistwood pillars rise on either side of this hallway, their smoothly curved boles rising gracefully to support the low ceiling in a spreading web of interlocked branches.  A single, perfectly round window allows a beam of moonlight to illumine an intricate tapestry woven in pale greens, yellows and ivory.  To the west, the hallway slopes downward towards a brighter section.",
