      "Sturdy frames of haon line this narrow cavern, probably from a previous mining expedition that discovered little of note down this path.  The current owner has nailed additional boards to the frame, as if uncertain about its ability to keep the roof overhead.  A free-standing rack and a low table face each other in the center of the area, alone aside from a clerk perched upon a stool."
