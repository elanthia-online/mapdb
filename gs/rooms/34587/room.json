      "Swirling about the room is an opaque mist, which conceals the walls and floors, yet leaves a small area open around a curtained arch.  From time to time the mist parts, allowing shadowed forms to move in and out of the chamber.  Soft globes of light hover about, sending beams of pale illumination through the haziness."
