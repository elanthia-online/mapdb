      "Shelves neatly stocked with tools, brass key blanks, and lock components line the wooden walls of the workspace.  Beneath a row of hanging lanterns, a dark-stained wooden workbench stretches long, reflecting their warm glow.  Precisely arranged screwdrivers, files, and lathes rest on the workbench's surface, while labeled drawers below offer organized storage.  In the corner, a small anvil sits on a reinforced stand, ensuring everything needed is within easy reach."
