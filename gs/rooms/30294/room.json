      "Shops dominate the small clearing cut into the foliage, lining either side of the path.  Backdropped by a sinuous ridgeline, a canvas draped pavilion nestles under several spiky yucca trees that lean over the walkway to the east.  A sapphire mohair wool tent stands opposite, sheltered beneath the intertwining leaves and fronds of tall date palms and a gnarled elephant tree."
