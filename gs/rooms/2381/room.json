      "Narrowing to a tenuous thread of cobblestone, the street is crowded by huddled houses with snow-dusted yards.  Thick fog drapes the street, though the locals largely ignore its presence as they shuffle on their way to one task or another.  A brightly illuminated shop sits between a bank of snow and a corner street light, the sign above its entry swaying in the wintry air.",
      "The road narrows here as houses crowd the street.  Some halflings wander past in the fog, talking to themselves."
