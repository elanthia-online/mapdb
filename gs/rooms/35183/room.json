      "Beneath an adequate fel roof, thick pine planks form a sturdy square floor raised a single ply from the ground.  Scraps of various woods offer a railing to lean against, opposite a chipped cobblestone archway bookended by a front-lipped sloped maple table and an elevated tinted glass display."
