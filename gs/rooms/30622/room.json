      "Dominating the far wall of this slightly curved room is a pitted driftwood counter, its surface rough and unpolished.  Padded chairs, perched on tall legs, are scattered about the area.  Looking out over the city, a tall, narrow window gives a beautiful view of the docks.  A pair of bronze sconces illuminate the room with a pale light cast through filmy glass panes."
