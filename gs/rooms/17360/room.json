      "The arched door to your east stands open, admitting a breeze that stirs the humid air.  The whitewashed walls bear water stains that someone has tried unsuccessfully to hide behind a potted fern.  A utilitarian set of steel armor stands nearby, its surface blooming with the first signs of rust in the damp atmosphere."
