      "The platform follows the contour of a tanik tree to the south and butts up against its rough bark.  The north side has a stout wood-beamed railing to prevent a drop down to the forest floor.  The only break in the beams is for a rope ladder leading down to the ground.  Carved into the bark is a pair of initials surrounded by a crude heart."
