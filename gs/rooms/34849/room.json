      "Dust-caked bookcases span from floor-to-ceiling, the various levels cluttered with broken ladders scattered along the expansive room.  A sheet-covered chandelier hangs three stories above the dirt-covered parquetry, the cobweb-draped spectre hanging precariously from thick, rusted chains creaking with the ambient breeze seeping through the cracked dome ceiling.  Haphazardly strewn about are several tables and velvet-padded chairs, the furniture partially buried beneath decayed foliage and torn curtains."
