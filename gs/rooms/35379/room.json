      "Winding upward along the sinuous neck of the dragon carved into the stone, the staircase curves gently away from the cliff face as it ascends towards the head at one end and descends to the shoulders on the other.  Solid railings of dark iron guard against falls as both the eastern and western sides are open to the air.  A majestic view of the dragon's head reveals enormous aquamarine stones set in the eye sockets, their topaz centers glowing like twin suns."
