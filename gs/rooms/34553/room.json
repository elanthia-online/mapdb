      "Short silver-lacquered shelves are interspersed along the pale blue brocaded walls of the wagon, displaying a variety of cobbled footwear inset with adornments of jewels and glass.  Lantern-framed racks of willow sit at the center of the shop, the neatly wound bolts of fabric stacked vertically between the flora-painted slats.  An elongated worktable stands against the back wall, its leathery surface covered in a kaleidoscope of dyes sorted in uniform rows."
