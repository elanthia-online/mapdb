      "Connected by a series of raised, lantern-lit walkways, wooden platforms at varying heights are cloistered beneath native leafy canopies of liana-draped boughs.  Tubular, bronze-dipped wind chimes sway above a lacquered lacewood desk and matching chair, which are cleverly bowered amongst graceful branches.  An occasional butterfly drifts in and out, fluttering through patches of diffused sunlight."
