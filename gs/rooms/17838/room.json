      "A grand entry and marble tiled floor beckons you deeper into the building to explore the luxuries contained therein.  Double doors lead to the courtyard, and a sweeping staircase leads up to the second level.  Cream colored, gold-veined marble composes the top of a spindle-legged occasional table that stands near the entryway."
