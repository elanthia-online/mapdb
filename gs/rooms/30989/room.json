      "Slabs of polished alabaster marble line the walls of the shop, veins of gold glistening in the pale light of a trio of silver lamps that hang from the domed ceiling.  A pair of cushioned velvet-covered chairs rest on a thick carpet of woven silk that covers the elegant stone floor.  Some dark mahogany shelves that are filled with various books, tomes, and volumes line the side of the spacious room.  Hanging by the entrance is a polished wooden plaque."
