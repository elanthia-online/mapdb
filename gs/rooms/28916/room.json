      "Single-story cottages, their windows framed by dark shutters, spread across the lane, each with a small side garden and high grassy lawn encircled by picket fences.

A small glade of manicured grass with picnic tables encircles a crumbling stucco bar painted with a colorful keg-shaped sign.",
