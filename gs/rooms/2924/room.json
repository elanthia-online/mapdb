      "A towering mountain range peeks through the snowy haze to the north.  The rugged outline of the range is distinctive, looking remarkably like a giant woman sleeping on her side.  Streaks of snow line the ridges of the mountains.  Southwards, all that can be seen is the vast plain disappearing into a shroud of swirling powder.",
