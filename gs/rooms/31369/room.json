      "Marble pilasters bearing bas-reliefs of elven figures rise toward the arching ceiling.  A banquet table oversees the cleared space of the dance floor from a raised dais, while opposite stands a low gilded imflass sideboard full of refreshments beneath a long mirror wrought in imflass filigree.  Cushioned chairs, both around the table and along the far wall, offer ample seating.  Pale starlight streams in over the railing of an open balcony onto the dance floor, the encroaching shadows kept at bay by gilded candelabra."
