      "Sheltered from the wind by a pair of beech trees, blueberry bushes crown the hillock that is covered in a combination of sedge and tufted grasses.  To the north, the incline is steep with the greenery becoming more scattered amid the rocks, while to the west the wind has swept the cliff's edge bare except for a few pernicious shrubs.  The scent of fresh water rises on a fragile breeze out of the east."
