      "An altar covered in assorted bones stands imposingly at the center of the dais, undersized, knee-high stools arranged in a semicircle facing it.  Perched on a raised rectangle of stone with three steps leading up, a commanding chair flanked by diminutive tables overlooks the altar.  A stone mug rests on one table, and a pair of jagged stone knives sit on the other, their blades stained vermilion.",
      "A raised altar covered in assorted bones is in the center of the circular platform.  Small, knee-height stools sit in a semi-circle facing its surface.  A larger stool overlooks the altar with small tables on either side of it."
