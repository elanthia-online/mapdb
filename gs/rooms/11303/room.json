      "The grey rock floor has melted and reformed, creating long concentric ripples that radiate from a central blast point.  A shimmering crystal rests at the blast point, almost completely obscured by the dense, searingly hot smoke drifting slowly off its surface.  Glistening blobs of red and blue corundum rest imbedded in the stone, each placed within the shallow valley between two of the floor's ridges.  There is a wide hole in the ceiling and a stylized male face sculpted into the wall."
