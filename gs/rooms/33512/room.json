      "[The Brass Ring, Carousel]"
    ],
    "description": [
      "An assortment of carousel horses mounted on gilded poles encircle a moving platform beneath shiny metal rings hanging from a mirrored ceiling, just out of reach.  A rearing stallion carved from black fel follows a winged, poplar-carved pegasus, while a prancing, helmet-clad centaur takes its place in line behind a spiral-horned unicorn pulling a chariot.  Between the moving menagerie, a small red door with a brass knob is visible in the center support housing which is covered in colorful scenery panels."
