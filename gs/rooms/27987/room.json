      "Constructed to the same specifications as a roomy box stall, this space contains no horses, but instead displays the tools of a horse groomer's trade.  An open crate set upon the clean straw floor holds various currycombs, and a sturdy shelf upon one wall displays a selection of fine brushes.  Entry to the next box stall, perhaps with additional wares, is provided through a latticed archway draped with a red woolen horse blanket."
