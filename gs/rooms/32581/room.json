      "Thin lengths of fishing wire drape from one corner of the shop to the other, the nearly invisible threads suspending bamboo-framed lanterns shaped like colorful schools of fish, their dyed vellum scales covered in silver lacquer.  Overlapping scrolls of aged parchment cover the walls, inked with a nautical map of the continent's seaways, the teal waters dotted with various ships and sea creatures.  The faint scent of toasted spices wafts in from the northern area of the shop, followed by joyous singing."
