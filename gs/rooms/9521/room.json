      "The flow of bones reaches its end in this direction, and there is no outlet to allow the flow to continue.  The bones slide in through an aperture in the southern wall, but on all other sides the granite walls are solid and impenetrable.  A single stalagmite has formed near the northeast curve in the granite walls.  Its accompanying stalactite, if it even exists, is nowhere to be seen, and perhaps it still hangs far above in the darkness.  The stalagmite is quite curious in shape."
