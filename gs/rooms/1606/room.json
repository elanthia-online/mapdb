      "A squat building, hung about with old fishing nets fills the pier, with only a narrow gallery running south along its shoreward side and west along its northern side.  Mouth-watering aromas of cooking seafood waft through an arched doorway formed from the bleached jawbone of a mammoth sea troll."
