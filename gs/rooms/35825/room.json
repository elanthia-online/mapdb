      "Two shallow steps rise to meet an unadorned marble altar, its surface marked only by a hammered copper alms bowl encircled with a scattering of trinkets and baubles.  From above, the rafters vanish into shadow, their beams occasionally caught by shifting colors of Naidem's sky as they slip through the high windows and spread across the floor in uneven bands.  Beyond the altar hangs a row of ancient tapestries, their fabric thinned with age and their patterns lost to time, the faded threads blurring into obscurity against the wall."
