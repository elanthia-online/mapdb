      "Dominating a large portion of the cottage is an enormous loom that uses the main support beam as head roller.  Curtainless windows provide illumination from the perpetual twilight outside, while carefully shielded lanterns dispel even the most tenacious shadows.  At the forefront of the space are carefully arranged baskets and receptacles, each laden with bolts of fabric, with shelves above them that house stacks of paper."
