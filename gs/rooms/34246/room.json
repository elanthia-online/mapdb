      "Hot, stinking spray lingers on the muggy breeze of the subterrane, shot high into the air by geysers in the uneven ground below.  The distinctive rotten egg stench of sulphur lingers, thickest over the pools of multicolored water stagnating at the geysers' bases.  Moisture has slicked the stone of the bridge and collected in its gaping pores, leaving pallid yellow crustings of dust where it has dried."
