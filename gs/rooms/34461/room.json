      "Emanating a soft glow in the darkness, gold arathiel dandelions warm the window boxes of a hexagonal wood-crafted structure set betwixt the murmuring river as it wends into the woods and a squat olivewood building attached to an ornamented pergola.  A trio of hand-carved oak mushrooms dappled in grey lichen stands amongst the fragrant verdure in a lush herb garden, the greenery flourishing with wild abandon around lasimor plant markers."
