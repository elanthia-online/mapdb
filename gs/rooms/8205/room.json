      "The walls widen here, making it comfortable to take a moment's ease.  Although there's garbage about, a cool breeze wafting in from the east dilutes the stench a bit.  A soft gurgle of water is identifiable, emanating from the same direction as the fresher air.  Underfoot, the cave's floor has turned to a loose shale leading down towards the water's song."
