      "More jagged than smooth, but more curved than straight, the sides of the tunnel form natural shapes with bulges and recessions that spawn bizarre shadows along the ground in an already shadowy space.  Intermittent snorts and howls drift down the tunnel and then hang heavily in the air until sudden movement disperses the lingering pocket of noise."
