      "The interior is dimly lit by iron sconces and the walls lined with wooden beams, darkened from years of smoke and soot from a central hearth.  Shelves sag beneath an impressive collection of earthenware jugs, glass bottles, and wooden casks behind a bar crafted from a massive slab of salt-stained oak.  In the corner, a copper still affixed with a drakar plate gleams in the torchlight, its coils twisting over open flames."
