      "Racks made from thick, curved pieces of a steel-like material line all four walls of this small room.  The pieces of steel are spaced closely, so closely, in fact, that one can only catch an occasional glimpse of the reflection off a sharp edge or the curvature of what might be a handle.  The variations in the electric blue lighting make it difficult to see into the racks, though, so the exact nature of what is inside is open to conjecture.  They could hold lethal weaponry or just gardening tools."
