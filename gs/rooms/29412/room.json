      "From a censer set upon a small altar at the rear of the pavilion, the scents of cardamom and vanilla fill the air with a smoky redolence, and the warm amber light from the glaes orbs dangling overhead is made soft and suffuse by the tendrils of pale incense.  Colorful rugs and pillows are scattered across the floor, and a variety of exotic skins and hides are draped across the support beams above."
