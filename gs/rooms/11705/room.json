    "description": [
      "Dead branches of a sycamore brush against the corner where the east and north walls meet.  Unlikely to have been allowed to grow so close to the walls of the keep, the tree appears to have begun and ended its life years after the occupation of the fortification ceased.  Placed throughout and upon its branches are the abandoned twig nests of unknown birds who made their home in the tree and have since departed."
