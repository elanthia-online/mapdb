      "The trail winds between large rocks and sharp stone rubble.  As it proceeds toward a dead end to the southwest, the sheer drop into the ravine on the north shoulder crowds closer, adding to the precarious nature of the walk.  Drifting clouds of smoke roll over the edge of the bluff above, like a waterfall cascading in slow motion."
