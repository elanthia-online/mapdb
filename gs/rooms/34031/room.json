    "description": [
      "Powdery snow blankets the tableland near the northern end of a high pass, glinting in the frigid starlight like diamond dust.  A pale stone roadway, nearly concealed by the shiftless drifts, climbs to follow the rise of the terrain, delving northward toward a shrouded mountain in the distance.  Hardy pines dotting the landscape leaven the sea of white with rare glimpses of rich greenery, standing proud and tall despite the weight of the snowfall."
