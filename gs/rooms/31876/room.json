      "Dimly lit by dusty lanterns, the tiny room is split in twain by a bead and bone curtain, its floor littered with bits of straw and chicken feathers that drift down from the thatched roof.  A rickety apothecary cabinet perches on the uneven and warped wooden floor, a scuffed wattle chest crowding at its clawed feet.  In perhaps an effort to cheer up the room, a chipped vase of mournblooms sits next to a bright orange notice."
