      "The dusty odor of decaying wood commingles with the bitterness of brine on the cruel gale.  Pilings breach up from the water like rotting teeth in a crooked grin, broken and blackened.  A nearby pile heaped on the planks is more mildew than canvas.",
      "The wood of the westernmost pier has silvered unevenly, leaving a strange stripe pattern in the warped planks as they alternate between grey and black.  The nails securing the planks are spotted with rust that makes each look as if it sits in a pool of old dried blood.  Traceries of rime glisten from the wood, lending a glint of natural beauty to the manmade decay."
