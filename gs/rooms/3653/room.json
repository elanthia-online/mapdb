      "Soft moonlight dapples the awnings that accent the shops along Wisteria Lane, subduing their bright colors into shades of cool grey.  Light cast from candles displayed in windows dances upon the cobblestone street, beckoning passersby into the warm homes.  Tall, wrought iron street lanterns stand guard over the vacant sidewalks.",
      "Tidy shops and cottages line both sides of the street, accented with colorful awnings in simple striped and plaid patterns.  Outside the open doorways of many shops are hand-painted signs, inviting passersby to stop and enter.  An old dwarf on tall stilts nimbly moves down the road between the wrought iron lanterns, filling each with oil for the coming night.",
