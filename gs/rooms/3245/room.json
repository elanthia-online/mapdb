      "Deep pits fortified with large stones and boulders still remain as quiet momentos of the war that ravaged this plain.  Dented greaves and smashed helms lie crushed between two huge boulders, implying the violence of previous battles.  Wind screeches through the gaps in the low rock walls, bringing a terrifying, ominous song to the area."
