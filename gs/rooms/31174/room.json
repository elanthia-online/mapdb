      "Crowded with dwarf pampas grass and fragrant lilacs, the small alley is framed by shattered and discarded birch trees that lay partially rotted in the shorter grass that covers the ground.  Stripped by industrious fingers or claws, ribbons of bright white bark are scattered about and resemble tightly wound corkscrews.  Though sheltered by granite walls from the wind, the distant sound of its whistling passage fills the air."
