      "Cracked planks jut from the hull of a capsized ship, their edges fractured by the relentless tide.  The once-varnished wood, scoured and silvered by the elements, is coated with barnacles and crowded with oysters.  Much of the ship lurks as a nebulous shadow beneath the waterline.  Clumps of reddish sargassum drift around the wreckage, tossed cruelly by the angry tide."
