      "Lashed woods form the stall's frame, each pole bound with braided feathergrass rope that has faded to a soft beige along its twisting strands.  The entire back wall rises in a mural of the surrounding grasslands, its rolling shapes rendered in dyed bark, dried moss, and layered leaves pressed flat against the panels.  Spanning the front of the space, a lashed dark walnut twig table creates a clean divide between the work area and the steady flow of the market's thoroughfare."
