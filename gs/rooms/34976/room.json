      "The path climbs onerously toward black cliffs in the distance, aided on its way by rough-carved steps hewn out of the dark stone of the sandy ridge.  Sea birds circle above, dark shapes against the starry blackness of the sky.  Their cries echo off of the surrounding rocks, filling the air with a shrill cacophony."
