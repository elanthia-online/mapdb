      "The small road terminates here in a circle of cobblestones fronting a two-story riverstone building.  Hedges of blackthorn, yew, and holly loom on three sides, effectively cutting this small cul-de-sac off from the rest of the enclave unless approaching by the road.  Set between clever statuary comprised of stone and gears, cheerful flowerbeds add splashes of color against the vibrant greens of the hedges."
