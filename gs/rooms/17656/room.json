      "The tunnel dead-ends into a vaulted chamber constructed of enormous blocks of granite and thick oak timbers.  Across the stone floor is a light layer of grit tracked in from the tunnel to the northeast, which leads to a large iron-bound door set into the west wall of the vaulted room.  Two torches flank either side of the door, burning brightly, while their smoke stains the ceiling above them a sooty black."
