      "Perched upon the intersection of two streets, a triangular building of white stucco with a terracotta-shingled roof fills the southern section of the block.  To the east, a large thoroughfare follows the patchwork sandstone blocks of the Old Ward Wall, while to the west, a narrower road slips through the town along the edges of the New Ward Wall.  Bustling with both foot and mount travelers, a steady stream of traffic moves through the northern gates."
