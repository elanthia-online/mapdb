      "This small clearing has several haphazardly placed burial markers and sites, and while once upon a time there may have been an attempt to keep the area clear, the foliage threatens now to overwhelm it.  Spiderwebs of significant size drape from vines and headstones, roses rampage wildly across graves, and thick tufts of grass choke reliquaries.  Narrow trails and footpaths venture into the dark, vegetative depths beyond."
