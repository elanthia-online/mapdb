      "A spent torch lies in a puddle at the edge of the passage, its oilskin charred.  There is no sign of its owner, but it has lain in place for long enough that fungi have sprouted over its wooden shaft.  Veins of mithril ore streak through the walls to either side, the cloudy blue of the metal stark against the surrounding black granite."
