      "Eddies and currents tug at the rafts of thickly-tarred barrels supporting this walkway that parallels the river.  Barrels of refuse line the boardwalk on either side.  A concerted effort has obviously been made to keep the marsh free of debris.  To the southwest, a crowded pier juts out into Solhaven Bay.  To the north, the walkway drives deeper into Marshtown."
