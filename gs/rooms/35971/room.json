      "Sloping subtly downward, the trail crosses a brook whose waters spread outward in a shallow run across smooth stones.  Moss clings to their damp surfaces, lending a muted green sheen where the light catches.  The water moves with a soft, lyrical cadence, its current slipping southwest beneath natural pillars of granite.  Overhead, the canopy presses close, dimming the passage in a gloom where little light breaks through."
