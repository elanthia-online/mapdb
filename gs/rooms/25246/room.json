      "Beneath a series of blindingly bright soulstones suspended from the ceiling on thick chains, there lies a long steel table affixed with cuffs at the side and bottom.  By its side, atop a small acacia wood stool, are arrayed a series of small knives, prongs, and other tools on a spread of clean linen.  The entire area is impeccably clean save for a single tiny stain that has sunk indelibly into the sandstone floor, reddening it."
