      "Towering overhead, the stone walls of the pass reveal only a narrow band of dimly-lit, night sky and veil-like clouds above.  Lower on one wall, perhaps at the height of a human midsection, a vague pattern of crude marks scars the otherwise smooth stone.  Etched into the hard surface with a dagger or spike, the diagonal pattern resembles a trio of claw marks.",
