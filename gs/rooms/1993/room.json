      "A tall stone bridge spans the river, which rushes toward the northeast.  Hooves clip-clopping on the cobblestones, burros pull wooden carts piled high with fresh-cut timber.  The drovers are all dwarves and giantmen.  They ignore you as they head south, toward the canyon.  Over the burblings of the water, you hear the faint echoes of a busy town in the distance."
