      "Enclosed by refined oak-paneled walls, the shop features an elegantly dressed maiden statue in the center of its dark oak floor.  A tattered merchant permit hangs under the Vornavian silk ceiling.  Right near the front is a hammered copper hanging rack and a Vornavian silk-lined display case."
