      "The permafrost is stained a dark red-black.  Great claw marks score the frosty earth's surface and have left behind spiderwebbing cracks across it.  Chunks of cyclopean stone are torn out of the northern wall of the fane, revealing the wider, close-fitted blocks of its inner wall, which are darker in hue and with rougher surfaces than the wind-smoothed facade."
