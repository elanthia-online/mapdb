      "The interior of the cottage is painted a pale cerulean blue and simple crenelated molding at the top of the walls gives way to a slightly domed, white-painted ceiling.  The pine plank floors are lacquered to a glossy sheen, except for a dull, scuffed pathway leading directly from the front door to the clerk's podium at the rear.  Positioned strategically amidst the worn sections, a few benches divert visitors toward the perimeter of the room."
