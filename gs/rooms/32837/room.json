      "A small branch of the Mistydeep river has undercut the city wall near a tall lasimor tree and forms a serene pool amidst the lush flora of the garden.  Large flagstones form a meandering path between fragrant roses and flowering cherry trees leading from the brick patio to a small fishing dock on the edge of the tranquil pool.  A large brick hearth fills the center of the patio, several rattan chairs surrounding it.  Dark crimson pots filled with trailing, bright white-laced yellow plumeria flank a set of glass double doors leading back into the manor."
