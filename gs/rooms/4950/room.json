      "Several tall shrubs cast their shadows across the dark grass that blankets the plateau.  The path winds its way in between the greenery, splitting into a fork.  One way lies a trail of rough terrain, while the other way appears to be well traveled and better tended.  A pine tree towers over the path, its branches swaying occasionally in the breeze.",
      "Several boulders are scattered across the emerald green grass that blankets the plateau.  The path winds its way in between the larger rocks while smaller stones rest on the path itself.  A pine tree towers over the path, its lower branches providing shelter against the elements.",
