      "Bright crimson crimson roses, climbing from glass-inlaid pots, line the pale ivory walls of the hallway.  The polished tanik floor is cushioned with a thick ramie silk carpet patterned in pale hues of golds and greens.  Hanging between the flowers are an ornate brocade curtain and a silvery velvet curtain embroidered with a blossoming sovyn clove."
