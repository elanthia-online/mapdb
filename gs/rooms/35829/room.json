      "Moss carpets the ground in a dense, springy layer, its emerald nap muffling all movement within the hyrrad.  Slender saplings, coaxed into graceful arcs, form the walls and ceiling, their living boughs braided to hold the structure aloft.  A single opening above frames the aurora-kissed sky, its shifting hues spilling onto a low wooden table, while around the opening dangle sheaths, scabbards, and cases of varied size, each suspended by cords that sway gently with the movement of air on the exterior."
