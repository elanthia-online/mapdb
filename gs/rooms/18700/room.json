      "Tucked between two of the cells, and well out of reach, is a copper-chained pump system mounted into a bucket-like sump in the floor.  A long, cast-iron lever stands motionless despite the sound of gurgling water that occasionally sloshes up out of the sump to wet the pitch-slathered deck.  A slight warping in the wooden planks and watermarks on the oaken bulkheads bear testament to the ravages of water within the area at some point in the past."
