      "Sunlight floods into the tunnel from a bright opening silhouetted with the dark lines of tall reeds and stacked crates.  A cool breeze tugs at the reeds at the opening of the entrance and stirs dead leaves and grasses tracked into the tunnel from outside, before disappearing deeper into the tunnel.  From nearby comes the sound of a large river, as well as the sound of foot traffic over wooden boards.",
