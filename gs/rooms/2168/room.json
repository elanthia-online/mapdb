      "The trail crooks between lava pools and piles of sharp, broken rock, its track unsure and torturous.  It follows the slope to the tier above closely, skirting boulders and the entrances to small caves.  A massive boulder forces it to dog-leg to the north, winding around the stone's base in a narrow defile."
