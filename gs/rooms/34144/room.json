      "Winding though a labyrinth of aspens, a quiet river of crystal blue water flows strongly through the wood.  A series of elaborately constructed rowboats lay beached in disarray nearby, their gunwales hacked apart and hulls pierced with crudely made black-fletched arrows.  Whatever happened, it was long ago, as the boats and their fletched adornments are in an advanced state of decay."
