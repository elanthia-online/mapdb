      "Silhouettes of passersby drift across a starburst glass-paned wall.  Glimpses of stars can be seen overhead, obstructed occasionally by passing swirls of mist.   Some planters and baskets holding various flora are arranged throughout, while a mud-splattered sign located on a small sales counter sits near the entrance.  A framed doorway leads to a conjoined space, perhaps a small work or storage area.",
      "Light filters in through each glass-paned wall as well as from the ceiling overhead, obstructed occasionally by passing swirls of mist.   Some planters and baskets holding various flora are arranged throughout, while a mud-splattered sign located on a small sales counter sits near the entrance.  A framed doorway leads to a conjoined space, perhaps a small work or storage area."
