      "Flowers envelop this covered patio, their sweet scent undercut slightly by the smell of fragrantly rich olive oil and the faint hint of ocean air.  A black and white tiled path encircles the area, centered by a raised stone platform surrounded by soft, unnaturally gleaming grass.  Along the path are a variety of cushioned leather couches and a small serving table, and a glass-paneled door traced with silvery lor leads back inside."
