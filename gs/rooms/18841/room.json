The surface of the edifice reveals the handiwork of ancient masons as windows and platforms emerge from the tower's face, skillfully hewn from granite.  Details are obscure, but the imposing structure exudes an aura of desolation.  At the island's rim, a mottled brown lizard suns itself on a shelf of bedrock.",
