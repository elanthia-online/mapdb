      "Intricately woven tapestries hang above wainscoting of polished rosewood, giving a warmth and intimacy to this generously-sized room.  Several leather settees with matching footstools are clustered around a chalcedony fireplace, above which is hung a silver looking-glass.  A large rosewood table set in one corner, flanked by twin white and blue banners, offers a repast for weary travellers.  A sapphire and white quartz medallion, set above a chalcedony wrapped arch leading into this room, shimmers slightly in the light."
