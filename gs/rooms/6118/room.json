      "Making a slight bend here, the canyon winds its way around the rock outcrop.  Deep shadows permeate the canyon as it narrows, making the darkness of night seem almost an ink black void.  Chattering noises can be distinctly heard from a large crack in the rockface to the east while water slowly drips from icicles that hang from smaller cracks in the southern canyon wall.",
