      "Thin rivulets run down the spiralled flutings of columns framing the vestibule's entry, the water flowing into seaglass-filled channels carved into marble floors leading toward a driftwood arch.  Petrified coral sconces with flickering cerulean candles accent a mosaic crafted from broken shells spanning rockface walls."
