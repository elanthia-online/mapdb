      "The warming aromas of drakefern tea and bittersweet chocolate add cozy appeal to the expansive eating area.  A round-bellied cast iron stove, a rectangular steel sink, and a sleek silver-woven bin are spaced evenly apart within the dark granite counters.  A tiger maple butcher block is securely bolted down in front of a hand-turned maoral dining table, allowing hosts the chance to interact with guests while cooking.  A narrow stairway nearly mirrors the same upward ascension of a flight of steps opposite of their placement on the back wall."
