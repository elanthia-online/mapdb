      "Seawater cascades down from the huge disc on all sides, feeding an overgrowth of multicolored coral that scales the base of the structure.  Along the immense supporting column of blue stone, there are places where dying coral has fallen away, revealing stone undamaged by the gnawing of the sea.  Carvings taller than a giant depict figures overlooking seas churned by storms, and they bleed sickly greenish stormglow that casts the surroundings in a sallow pall."
