      "A bank of windows faces a large driftwood bed covered in exotic furs.  To the side of the bed sits a matching driftwood desk and chair, ornately carved.  One wall is covered with a large tapestry, its vivid colors and intricate detail competing for the viewer's eye with a massive, stuffed polar bear in the opposite corner.  An expansive stone fireplace offers a cheerful fire to give light and warmth to the chamber."
