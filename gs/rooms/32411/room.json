      "The remains of a fine mirror are scattered across the roadway, the silver-backed fragments commingled with more mundane glass.  The source of both appears to be a broken window two stories above in the facade of a high basalt edifice.  Through the cracked aperture is visible the decomposing husk of a handsome apartment, silken hangings and gilded furnishings spotted with mold and rot."
