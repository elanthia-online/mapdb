      "A carpeted walkway, flanked by a silk-draped podium, leads from the entrance toward the back wall, which is almost entirely covered by a massive bas-relief sculpture.  A clear glass globe hangs from a thin braided invar cable over the head of the mannequin standing in the corner.  A round table has been spread with a bountiful meal, suitable for a hungry dwarven family.  A sparkling crystal ball serves as a center piece."
