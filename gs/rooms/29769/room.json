      "Resembling a gnomish mechanism, the chandelier that hangs from the ceiling is wrought in the image of a mechanical octopus that is juggling frosted globes.  The beast's one eye is dominated by a monocle that is pinned to a wrought iron bowtie, while its head is topped with a jauntily-set tricorne.  Beneath, a carpet woven in a sea wave pattern stretches across the cold ground, a simple wooden table resting at its center."
