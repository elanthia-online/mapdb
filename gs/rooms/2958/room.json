      "The coffered ceilings are of dark, ancient oak, trimmed faintly with gold leaf.  A faded grey and black mural on the plaster over the fireplace depicts the abbey in the days before it was converted from private residence to religious settlement.  Heraldic devices, faded with time, are painted on either side of the mural."
