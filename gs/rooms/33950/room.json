      "The cozy interior of the small house is arranged in balanced quartets and quintets of objects, displaying matching elemental motifs throughout.  A large tapestry hangs on the back wall of the room and plush carpeting covers the floors.  A dark ironwood necklace stand and an engraved mithril ring display maintain pride of place as the everything in the room is designed to draw attention to them."
