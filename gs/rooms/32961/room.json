      "The area opens up into a large space of gated sections carved into the riverstone walls.  Down each aisle are rows of cells, each housing an unwashed Krolvin secured behind a dark iron gate.  The prisoners cower in the furthest corners of their cells and avoid all eye contact.  A single stone stalagmite placed in a large space in the center of the room, viewable from all cells, is covered in dried blood."
