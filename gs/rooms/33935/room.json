      "Exposed rafters are covered in frosted globes that shed their bright light upon the wares that fill the shelving units that line the walls of the small but quaint shop.  Thick carpets dampen the chill that rises from the floor, while a riverstone fireplace has a banked fire laid in it that keeps the dampness from the air.  Several storage baskets are scattered along the walls, though noticeably vacant from the path of a nearby door."
