      "Stacks of canvas covered in bright paints line the walls of the spacious workroom.  Several easels are set up displaying partially completed bits of art.  A pair of windows lines the walls helping a series of lamps to illuminate the space.  Splattered drop clothes cover much of the flooring and a small workbench sits at the back of the space."
