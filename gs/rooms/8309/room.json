      "The interior of this hut is sparsely furnished, aside from the usual tools and items required for day-to-day survival.  A dented bronze cauldron sits in an ash-filled depression in the middle of the floor, with a rough hole in the thatched roof directly above it.  The walls are decorated with charcoal renderings of a primitive yet awe-inspiring nature."
