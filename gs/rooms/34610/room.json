      "Sumptuous figures in bas-relief twist and writhe along the ivy-clad walls of a pale temple complex.  The shadows of the greenery conceal some of the cavorting shapes, though they provide no modesty for the licentious entanglements of others.  Clad in a coat of dark green lacquer, the bars of the temple's bronze gates are wrought to resemble wisps of drifting smoke.  They open onto a garden ablossom with orchid, rockrose, and styrax in resplendent display."
