      "The basso croak of a bullfrog and the trill of crickets are the only sounds to be heard in the still air of the salt marsh.  The boggy trail is only slightly more firm than the reeking muck on either side.  The pale moonlight reflects eerily in the small patches of brackish water.",
      "The oily screech of a marsh bird and the high-pitched humming of midges and gnats are the only sounds to be heard in the still air of the salt marsh.  The boggy trail is only slightly more firm than the reeking muck on either side.  The sunlight seems hazy, as if the weight of the air leans too heavily on the light."
