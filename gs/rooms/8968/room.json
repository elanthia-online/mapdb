    "description": [
      "Leaftoe Circle passes a quiet row of houses, their chimneys puffing out smoke over their red tiled roofs.  The buildings sit close to the street, but some of the residents have made the most of what stoop they have.  Small benches and decorative stone ornaments carved in the likenesses of animals perch neatly in front of the homes.  From beyond the last house on the lane, the busy commotion of Icemule's more commercial quarters can be faintly heard."
