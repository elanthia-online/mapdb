      "Centered in this bustling kitchen is a long maoral butcher block worktable.  Cast iron stoves line one wall with copper shelves holding spices and containers.  Glass oil lamps flicker brightly, illuminating the room as the mullioned windows offer a view of dancing fireflies.  Baker's racks are situated next to a large brick oven, while small tables holding trays of food sit opposite a horizontally divided oak door.  Nearly hidden in a recess are a long basin and an insulated ice box."
