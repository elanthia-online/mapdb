      "This mysterious cavern appears to have been purposefully crafted and carefully hidden by the growing brambles.  What little moonlight makes it through the brambles creates shifting and unsettling shadows on the walls, the dripping of water creating an odd accompaniment which seems to coincide with the shifting shadows.  In the shadows, you notice a small tunnel leading down steeply.",
