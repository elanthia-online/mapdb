      "A translucent vein of rich cerulean glaes runs evenly down the central length of the bridge as it arcs over the dizzying chasm, chased by inlaid gold.  Only the blazing chandeliers above permit any estimation of distance from the high, worked stone ceiling of the cavern.  Hoarbeam rails flank the bridge to keep unwary travelers from the cavernous depths to either side."
