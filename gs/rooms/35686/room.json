      "Steps of stone the color of the ocean near sunset climb toward the center of the dais, passing between sediment deposits that resemble great, spent candles.  The scent of burnt ozone is oppressive, an acrid intrusion onto the scouring ocean winds, and an electric tingle suffuses the air and thrums through the stone like a faltering heartbeat.  Green-tinged white light surges from the stone, lighting the path in ebbs and flows."
