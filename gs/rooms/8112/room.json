      "Houses made of mortared rocks flank the pathway.  Thatched roofs extend further from the walls than seem normal.  A fluffy, white cat sits in one of the windows, licking its paw with utter concentration.  It did seem like its bright blue eyes were looking out of the window just a moment ago."
