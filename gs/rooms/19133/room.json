      "The gentle sounds of waves breaking on a light-colored sand beach fill the air.  A series of small dunes dot the edge of the beach, marking the perimeter.  A cracked and aged wooden signpost leans haphazardly to one side, and the wall into which a hatch is set is a magnificent mural of a wide-open ocean dotted with white clouds.  Brilliant sunlight bombards the beach here through a portal cut into the ceiling."
