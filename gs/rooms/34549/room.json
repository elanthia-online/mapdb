      "Soft candlelight illuminates the tapestry-covered walls and reveals a mosaic floor depicting ever-widening tiled spirals of every hue imaginable.  Along each wall, lengthy tables fashioned of mismatched doors atop waist-high piles of junk are burdened with jewelry cases, books, and a disorganized gallimaufry of other goods.  At the far end of the room, a weighty patchwork curtain effectively conceals what lies beyond."
