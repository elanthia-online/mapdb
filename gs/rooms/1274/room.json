      "As the raised platform approaches the Cairnfang river, less and less stable soil is available to support the buildings and inhabitants of Marshtown.  Rafts of large barrels have been tied together and serve as flotation for the walkway and the squat wooden buildings that line either side.  A breathtaking and living display of color takes place in the waters to the southeast as the crystal waters of the Cairnfang mingle with the bluer waters of Solhaven Bay.",
