      "The street narrows here, wide enough for only a single cart.  Unfortunately, two carts headed in opposite directions have met in the middle.  The dwarven drovers glare red-faced at one another, hurling imprecations in their guttural tongue.  Their mules stand by placidly, occasionally munching on the shrubs by the side of the road."
