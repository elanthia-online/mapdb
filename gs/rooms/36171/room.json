      "Glossy, golden linden floors reflect the warm sunlight as it trickles in through the shutter-lined windows that adorn each of the small room's white-washed, knotted oak walls.  Multi-hued braided rugs are scattered in overlapping layers in the center and are held in place by two armchairs and a low divan.  A large fireplace adorned with a mahogany mantle is flanked by floor-to-ceiling bookcases, which house dormant hurricane lanterns."
