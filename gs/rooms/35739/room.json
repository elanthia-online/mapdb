      "A black-planked forecastle slopes toward the broken bowsprit of the ship, the timbers of which sag beneath the weight of their own decay.  Black, damp rigging trails across the deck like tangles of dead worms, fallen from bollards that are little more than rusted stumps.  The warship's peculiar figurehead peeks just over the rail, bald head turned to watch oncoming waves."
