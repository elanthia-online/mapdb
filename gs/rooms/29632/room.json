      "Contrasting with the rest of the manor, this room is constructed from white marble ashlar blocks and boasts only narrow windows, fortifying its position at the back of the house.  A chandelier made from fused sword blades hangs from the vaulted ceiling, glinting in the sunlight.  Centered below it, a charcoal-filled brazier surmounts a hexagonal table strewn with maps on a crimson rug shot with golden embroidery.  Several tapestries hang on the walls between rows of wooden bookshelves overflowing with books and scrolls."
