      "Chests, boxes, and piles full of scrap metal and spare parts cover most of the floor.  The back wall of the room is singed in various locations above a massive mithril workbench.  An almost artistic display of scorched flooring, pock marks, gouges, metal shavings, and other assorted bits of material have piled up beneath the bench."
