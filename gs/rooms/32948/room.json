    "description": [
      "Waves crash upon the lower cliffs of the promontory, flooding porous rock and creating an echoing sound reminiscent of a flute being placed underwater.  Fountain grass frames the bare granite and creates a natural barrier that prevents access to the cliff's edge.  A stoic sentinel, a towering alabaster statue representing a warrior with his hands resting on a shield planted at his feet, gazes eastward."
