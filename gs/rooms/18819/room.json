      "Fragrant honeysuckle combines here with wild blackberry in a tangle of brush so thick it makes passage difficult.  The sweet flowers and succulent berries barely disguise the criss-crossing web of thorns sharp enough to rend garment and flesh.  Fireflies flicker here and there, obviously attracted to the dense humidity created by the stand of vegetation.",

The sweet flowers and succulent berries barely disguise the criss-crossing web of thorns sharp enough to rend garment and flesh.  A tatter of faded blue fabric flutters on the breeze like a small signal flag."
