    "description": [
      "Mismatched chairs ring a lopsided wooden table, which is nothing more than a large crate overturned atop a barrel.  Scratched into the table's surface are a myriad of designs, including a rather large peacock.  The bird seems overly large and has X's for eyes.  The floor under the table is covered in something that is both slimy and sticky."
