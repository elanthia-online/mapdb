      "Set back from the other tables, the noise of the area is hushed here.  A cluster of windflowers is displayed prominently from within a wide spun glass vase, their star-shaped white blossoms offset by the splash of pale pink from several dog roses.  Resting in the center of the cherrywood table is a short lilac votive."
