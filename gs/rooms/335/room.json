      "East Ring Road rejoins the Landing's palisades here and continues on inside it to its northernmost conclusion.  An occasional wagon laden with goods passes by, its metal-rimmed wheels echoing in the night as they strike rough spots in the pavement.  The merest hint of the scent of flowers and fragrant herbs drifts over from the south.",
      "East Ring Road rejoins the Landing's palisades here and continues on inside it to its northernmost conclusion.  Wagons laden with empty barrels, heavy kegs, cords of firewood and sacks ply the road, creating a loud din as their metal-rimmed wheels strike rough spots in the pavement.  The merest hint of the scent of flowers and fragrant herbs drifts over from the south."
