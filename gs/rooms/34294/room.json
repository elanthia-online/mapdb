      "Strong winds from the Dragonspine's lower ridges culminate and cause an uneven terrain to become more hazardous for travel.  Large birch trees have succumbed to the powerful gusts, while others have simply become slaves to the environmental demands, bending and swaying without vacillation.  Bits of debris litter the ground and cycle through a sundry list based on the wind's direction - from mushroom caps and flower petals, to fish bones and tufts of fur, this region lives in a state of disarray."
