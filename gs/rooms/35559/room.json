      "Nestled within the curve of a living reef, a hollow is ringed by encrusted coral and softly swaying sea fans.  Stone shelves carved into the walls are lined with delicate wares.  Strings of seashells crisscross above, strung from coral branches like garlands, their curved shapes catching the movement of the water.  Nets hang loosely in the corners, draped with shimmering sea threads and trailing bits of ribboned algae, while a driftwood counter stands near the back, worn smooth from use."
