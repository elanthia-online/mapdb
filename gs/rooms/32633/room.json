      "The stench in this room is just short of overwhelming, although prolonged exposure to it might very well bring tears to most anyone's eyes.  Four twisted metal racks balance over four misshapen holes bored directly into the floor, and the malevolent odor appears to waft up from out of the holes.  A soft gurgling seems to also emerge from the holes, as if water is moving slowly around deep within the openings."
