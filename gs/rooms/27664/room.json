      "Clovertooth pages saunter by routinely, acknowledging guests with a casual greeting as they check to ensure the half-globe-enclosed torches are burning and have plenty of fuel.  To the north, the hallways appear to converge on a nexus, while to the southeast, a spiraling staircase descending to the first floor is visible.  From this view, the details of the dark marble statue in the center of the lobby below cannot quite be made out."
