      "A trio of carved wooden trees decorates the far wall of the stall, crafted from planks of ivory-washed jadewood and wrapped in colorful velvet ribbons.  A two-tiered white pine stand sits above a soft bearskin rug, the second shelf containing a frosted lapis glass bowl wrapped in a knitted ivory paeline scarf, the floor below it scattered with glinting bits of confetti."
