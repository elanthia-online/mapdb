      "The center of town opens up, the structures further apart than they are at the road's edge.  A tall slender building rises from a foundation of smooth stones to a roof of steep peaks and gables.  Around the perimeter of the house, a small garden has been cultivated behind a wood and wrought iron fence with a swinging gate."
