      "Barely rising above the water, the jagged rocks of the islet are littered with the remnants of ships.  Some of the wreckage is barely recognizable under layers of heaped kelp and hardy mosses, which cling to broken planks and rusted chains.  The endless crashing of the waves drowns out most sounds, but the occasional call of a hungry gull overhead manages to pierce through the roar."
