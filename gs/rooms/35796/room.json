      "Dense orchards surround the manicured lawn, protecting the edges of the estate.  An inviting garden thrives in between an old manor and its well-appointed stable, guarded by an enormous ancient modwir tree.  Wrapping their boughs in a semi-circle over the smaller plants, one tree with an especially thick branch supports a rope swing near the overgrown gated walkway."
