      "The half-translucent surroundings of crystal are marked with a variety of flowing runes, their wavy forms casting four distinct hues of light across the wide, cavernous surroundings.  A single black tome sits atop a dark onyx podium, its pages rustling ever so slightly with brief drafts of air flowing in from the east.  A small marble staircase leads into the upper sections of the tower, the faint hums of power from above reverberating around the room."
