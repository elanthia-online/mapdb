      "The trees lining the pond shade a small wooden dam that has been haphazardly thrown into the streambed.  Dark algae has collected on the sides of the pool, turning the water to a yellow-brown tint as it flows over the logs of the dam.  The gentle sounds of the water pouring over the dam and splashing on the rocks add a soothing touch to this rugged terrain."
