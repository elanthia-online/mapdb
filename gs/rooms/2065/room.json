      "Water laps at the crumbling edges of what were once flagstones, echoing across the deserted hills.  From somewhere not too far off, the calls of seabirds answer.  Tumbling water vines clog the river's edge and the roots of trees reach out into the refreshing water even where all dirt has been washed away."
