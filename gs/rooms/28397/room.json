      "Looming before you is a massive black stone structure, its upper reaches partially obscured by the swirling mist.  The structure appears to be some sort of a keep or possibly a small castle.  The stones forming it are irregularly sized but uniformly black.  Arrow slits dot the walls, and the crenellations at their apex are littered with a variety of fearsome-looking gargoyles.  Squarely in front of the rope bridge are two massive wooden doors."
