      "[Forest Trail]"
    ],
    "description": [
      "The trail winds through paper birch and poplar, which crowd the taller oaks.  Thick shrubs and brambles cower at the feet of the trees and infringe on the path.  Here and there, the way widens and shows evidence underfoot of an old road.  The track leads southeast where it disappears into deeper forest, and the faint susurrus of a brook can be heard from that direction."
