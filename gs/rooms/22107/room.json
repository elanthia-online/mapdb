      "Greenery around a charming manor provides a backdrop for a colorful array of flowers taking shelter under a grove of assorted fruit trees.  Burbling brightly, a multi-tiered riverstone fountain is surrounded by three carved benches.  A path of round stones meanders up a small hill to the steps of a gazebo, then down to a stunningly azure pond.  The ever-moving focal center of the garden, a muster of vibrantly plumed peacocks struts amongst the verdure.",
      "Bathed in soft moonlight, a large riverstone manor is surrounded by verdant greenery and a fragrant array of flowers and fruit trees.  Moonbeams bounce off of a burbling stone a multi-tiered riverstone fountain surrounded by three carved benches, and a path of round, grey stones meanders up a small hill to the gazebo steps, then down to a dark azure pond.  Occupying the ever-moving focal center of the garden, a muster of regal peacocks strut amongst the verdure, their colors eye-catching beneath the stars."
