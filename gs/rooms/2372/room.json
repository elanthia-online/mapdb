      "The north wall of the city is thickly rimed with ice, giving its carved surface an irony unintended by its artisan creators.  The lifesize bas-relief mural depicts a small cadre of robed halfling mages huddled together on the slopes of Mount Aenatumgana vanquishing a force of ice elementals."
