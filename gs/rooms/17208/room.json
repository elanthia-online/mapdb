      "A plethora of archery equipment hangs from wrought iron hooks along the plank walls, including enormous leather quivers stocked full of arrows.  Behind a sturdy pine worktable, a stout dwarven bowyer plies his craft with great dexterity, creating yet another quality bow to be sold.  The aroma of woods mingles pleasantly with the fragrant smoke emitted by smoldering logs in the small fireplace opposite a faded green door."
