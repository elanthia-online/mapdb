      "Flatbed wagons carrying loads of wood or other goods lumber slowly to the east and west, their wheels echoing in the night as they bounce over a large pothole in the road.  A nondescript building, with a prominent sign in the shape of a key above its black door, is set back slightly from the street, nearly hidden in the shadows.",
