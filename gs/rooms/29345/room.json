      "Against the back wall of this modestly sized cabin is a set of bookshelves that rise to the ceiling from the wall-to-wall cabinet upon which they sit.  Several richly cushioned chairs of golden oak and blue velvet are scattered throughout the remainder of the available space, all arranged so as to offer a comfortable view out of the cobalt-curtained bay window."
