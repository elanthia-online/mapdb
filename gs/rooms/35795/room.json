    "description": [
      "Perched high atop the central mast, the crow's nest sways gently in the tropical breeze.  The timber beneath is sun-bleached and marked with knife carvings of names, tally marks, and crude drawings left by bored lookouts over countless voyages.  Strapped securely to the railing of the crow's nest with leather bindings is a brass telescope, its polished casing gleaming.  A woven hammock is strung up, rocking slightly in the soft breeze.  Far below, the tropical island town bustles with color and sound."
