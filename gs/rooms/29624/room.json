      "Once a fully functional wing of the estate, all that remains are piles of rubble and a clearing littered with craters.  A small path wends through the rubble to the east meeting up with the hallway leading inside.  Inside the largest crater at the center, a sturdy steel workbench juts up obliquely amidst scorched jumbles of stone and mahogany.  A jagged crack zigzags through the rubble on the western rim of the large crater."
