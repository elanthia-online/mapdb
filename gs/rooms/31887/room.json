      "Lattices of dried liana vines cover the stone walls of the cottage, the entangled tendrils clinging to the corners of the apothecary table, which is covered in dried bundles of herbs and various gardening tools.  A duo of black cats lounge beneath the vine-draped table, kneading slowly across a fringed tartan blanket, then disappearing amongst a series of clay pots scattered across the ground.  Several leafy florals grow in a soil-filled cauldron  sits upon a low-set stool by an open window, the faint sounds of buzzing emanating between the blossoms.",
