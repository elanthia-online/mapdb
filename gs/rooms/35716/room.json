    "description": [
      "Crude fetishes fashioned from bone, feather, and woven vine dangle precariously from twisted branches lining the rocky trail as it descends toward a rocky gorge.  Their unsettling shapes cast faint, swaying shadows that dance silently over the stones of the path.  Natural arches of rock, worn smooth by the moaning winds, stretch overhead like the ribs of a fallen gargantuan.  Aside from the scraggly trees, only hardy grasses and tenacious mosses find purchase along the walls of the valley."
