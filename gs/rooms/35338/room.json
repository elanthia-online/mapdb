      "Warm light floods the library, spilling from large-globed lanterns that perch upon railing tops, as well as the surface of a round circulation desk that is attended by a willow-thin human librarian.  Forming a clover-shaped arch over both the entry and exit, a set of staircases fashioned of dark-burled camphor stained a reddish gold hue provide access to the floor above.  Railings and shelves in matching tones decorate the teal walls as they climb towards an enormous iron and glass skylight that is recessed into the domed ceiling."
