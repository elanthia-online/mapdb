    "description": [
      "Polygonal pavers fashioned of stones in dark grey form the round-edged floor of the veranda.  Bright white grout, the same vibrancy as the stucco that adorns the inn, gleams in the moonlight.  Decorative flowers, produced by painting on the stone with lime, sit at the center of each stone.  Scattered about, cobalt blue wicker chairs recline amid large terracotta urns teaming with verdant growth.  A pair of blue shutter doors provide entry to the inn."
