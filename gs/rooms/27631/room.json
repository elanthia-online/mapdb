      "Blue-speckled sea glass walls rise from a smooth slate floor.  Just above some puffed raw silk pillows hangs a carved whale tooth, and a glass-tiled vaulted ceiling completes the picture.  A glass-topped mistwood counter and an aqua-hued seaglass display stand side by side in the middle of the room.",
      "A colorful Icemule map hangs on one of the pale oak walls, and an oak-framed ceiling rises overhead.  A polar bear rug sits in one corner of a varnished oak floor.  There is a long varnished counter on one side of the shop and a dovetailed oak table on the other."
