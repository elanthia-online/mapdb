    "description": [
      "A frozen pile of spoor sits in the middle of the narrow passage through the briars, the stark bits of bone within suggesting that they are the leavings of a predator.  The sounds of wildlife, already thin and distant in such a forbidding clime, seem muted and distant.  Nearby, a dead fir's jagged stump is scratched and scored with claw marks where it protrudes from the briar."
