      "Two tall, lean figures, their features obscured by heavy dark cloaks, stand before a door forged from solid black ora.  Their eyes glint violet from beneath the deep cowls, as if daring you to test their skill with the Dhe'nari whip-blades they carry in their gloved hands.  Opposite the sentinels, a tunnel disappears into the darkness of the caverns."
