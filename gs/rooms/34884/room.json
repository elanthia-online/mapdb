      "Giant mounds of shriveled mushrooms loiter beside the pathway.  Several specimens have collapsed into large pools of slimy mushiness one would be loath to fall into.  Others maintain their tall forms overhead, but their caps droop and threaten to topple, while their sticky, discolored stems release as foul an odor as one can imagine."
