      "The passageway relents to the pressure of the mountain on all sides, dwindling to an impassable jumble of rocks.  Shadows are thick, adding the mystery of what lurks among the crevices within its folds.  The air hangs so still, the dust suspended in its grasp hangs like a transparent shroud."
