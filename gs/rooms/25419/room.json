      "A warm halo of sunlight filters through the crystalline dome above, each facet of the glass casting a bright golden mosaic along the textured stone floor.  The smooth stone walls of the shrine are enameled with the image of a large golden crown.  A track of worn, ashen grey carpet begins at the double doors and divides the chamber until ending just before a wide stone dais.  Upon the raised platform is a high altar crafted from blood marble, its soft white surface speckled with sanguine motes."
