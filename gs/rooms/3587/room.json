      "The passageway widens into an expansive chamber, with branches in various directions and the beginning of a wide, winding stairway.  To the north sits an alcove, its darker interior creating a gloomy maw at its entrance.  The southern hallway is likewise shadowy, however braziers can be glimpsed on the walls, promising the possibility of illumination."
