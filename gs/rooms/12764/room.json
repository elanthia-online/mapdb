      "A trail follows the bottom of a steep incline.  The jumble of rocks cloaking the slope above makes the track hazardous, and here and there, boulders fallen from above obstruct its progress.  On the narrow shelf's north shoulder, the ground falls into a deep ravine, its bottom lost in darkness.",
