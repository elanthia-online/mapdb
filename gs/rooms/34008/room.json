      "Butterflies and daisies paint the white walls with vibrant hues, their tiny designs illuminated by a pair of brightly burning glass globes set at either end of the long corridor.  Sashes laden with pins flank a polished bronze mirror that is hung upon the northern wall, while a small table beneath holds a jeweler's display rack and a cobalt blue blown glass bowl.  A small rug of verdant green muffles the sound of passage leading to a narrow staircase."
