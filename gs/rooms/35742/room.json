      "Mold-covered beams of warped oak sag over a narrow corridor made moreso by stacked crates half-submerged in murky seawater.  A few barrels have mostly rotted away, leaving behind rusted iron hoops resembling grate corroded bracelets.  Rimmed with jagged barnacles, a black steel hatch stands open, nearly torn from its tortured hinges."
