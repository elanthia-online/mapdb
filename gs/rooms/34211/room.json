    "description": [
      "Ropy threads of clotted silk, unlovely and mottled in hues of mustard and rust, droop from the mouth of a slick stone chute climbing to the warrens above.  Brackish water trickles from the aperture, trailing down the strands to patter on the spongy ground.  Its mineral scent is almost lost in the stifling sharpness of vinegar wafting by in noxious billows.  To the south, the tunnel wall gapes to reveal a sprawling an alien monument at the base of the grotto, the edifice centered around a vast crystal."
