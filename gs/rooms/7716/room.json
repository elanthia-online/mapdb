      "Arcing limestone formations rise into a small dome-like natural chamber here, considerably less cramped than the low surrounding tunnels.  Patches of ever-growing stalactites spread across the ceiling, their small forms slowly releasing a steady trickle of water onto the floor.  Three tunnels lead into the darkness."
