      "This room is alive with the near-constant happy warbling emanating from a large polished brass gilded cage containing a pair of bluebirds.  Formed from unfinished logs, the walls of the cabin are crafted and fitted so perfectly that none of the frigid air from outside can be felt.  A series of polished silver hooks are imbedded in the wood at eye height directly adjacent to the oak door, and a small stool sits just beneath them."
