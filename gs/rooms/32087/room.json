      "Neat and tidy, with stacks of sealed crates and locked and latched boxes, this room is immaculate, well arranged and well kept.  A glass-shelved bloodwood cabinet sits against the far wall, with an age-darkened parchment sign on the side of the cabinet that stands out against the vibrant hue of the wood."
