      "A flight of stairs opens into the office, a large, octagonal room occupying most of the building's third floor.  It has a high ceiling, rising into a dome painted with a representation of the sky.  Windows covered with wooden screens occupy most of the wall space.  Through the chinks in the intricately rendered patterns of the screens, truncated views of the town below can be seen.  A circular table sits in the chamber's center with high-backed chairs placed in a haphazard ring around its perimeter."
