      "Functional and sparse, this spacious office is vastly different than the rest of the castle, a testament to its occupant's humble nature.  A solid teak desk sits front and center atop a rattan mat amidst the bare white marble walls, a comfortable-looking chair its only companion.  Several low bookcases filled with tomes and loose scrolls and topped with a standard alembic, mortar, and pestle complete the remainder of the office's furnishings.  A soft light fills the area from no discernable source."
