    "description": [
      "High above the cluttered expanse of the main deck, the quarterdeck unfolds beneath the ragged sails of the mizzenmast.  The ship's wheel is black and timeworn, metal banding around its spokes more verdigris than bronze.  Nearby, a binnacle stands slightly askew, its compass face clouded and unreadable.  Patches of rust and peeling paint mar every surface, lending the once-proud post a tatterdemalion cast."
