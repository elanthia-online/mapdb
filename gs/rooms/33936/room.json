      "Housed in large glass globes, fireflies emit a yellow-green bioluminescence which reflects off of the polished hardwood walls and floorboards.  Swathes of colorful silks are draped from a collection of marble block pedastals supporting vases brimming with fans of iridescent peacock feathers.  A pair of glossy walnut armoires flank a lace-curtained opening near the rear of the wagon."
