      "Dainty vines laden with cream-throated lapis blossoms twist down slender tree trunks and tumble over the ground, tangling hazardously over the path as it meanders through the unbridled garden.  Casting a somber illumination over the tall flower spikes, deep blue-violet orbs drift through the profusion of wild indigo flourishing within their verdant leaves."
