      "Underfoot, the ground grows softer with every step and leads deeper into the mists that obscure visibility at any point further than an arm's length.  Shed by the pendant lanterns set along the fence posts, their amber light is transformed into warm but hazy clouds that lend some manner of comfort if not any aid to sight at all."
