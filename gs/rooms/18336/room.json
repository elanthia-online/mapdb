    ],
    "description": [
      "A particularly large limb extending from the trunk of the tree provides a comfortable perch to settle upon and observe the vast expanse of shadow-filled jungle both below and before it.  Enshrouded by the rest of the majestic being's vine-tangled limbs, the area is bestowed a reprieve from the heat by the rustling leaves and the chill of night.  The whisper of the evening wind blowing through the secluded retreat occasionally accompanies the low murmur of nocturnal creatures moving about the wilderness.",
