      "Artwork of Arkati and spirits cover the walls of this alcove, portraying those that claim Lornon as home.  Black pearl-filled runes are inlaid upon a glass-fronted cabinet which stands prominently to one side, while a smaller obsidian-inlaid curio stands opposite.  Sitting snuggly between the two is a low padded chair."
