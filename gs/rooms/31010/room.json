    "description": [
      "Cheerfully welcoming, two settees sit opposite each other, with a low, wide table separating them, at the workshop's entry.  Well-lit scroll artwork and tall, potted ferns offer tasteful decor, and the gentle babble of a stream originates from an ovaline water sculpture.  Spread across the stone tiles of far side of the room, tidily kept workbenches display sectioned boxes filled with the various parts and pieces of scroll cutting devices."
