      "Stepped landscaping forms flat grassy areas that graduate the incline of this steep hillside leading to the water's edge.  Small berms of mounded wildflowers spring up between each level area and the next one down.  From this vantage point, the rounded tops of surrounding hills are silhouetted against the night sky, and still waterways in the distance reflect pale shimmers of moonlight.  A pillow-topped white cotton hammock sways gently with passing breezes, strung between a pair of stately banyons."
