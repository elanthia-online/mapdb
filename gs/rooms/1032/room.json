      "The whole of Glo'antern Moor stretches out to the west, although much of it is shrouded in a dense layer of fog.  Strange pinpoints of light appear to flicker and dance in the mists.  Where the fog is not present the moor is a dark grey interspersed with small, lighter grey blotches.  A tall range of snow-capped mountains looms to the north, east and southeast, while a broad forest extends along far to the northwest.  In the distance a rock plateau rises above the mists, its top perfectly flat.",
