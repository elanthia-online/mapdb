      "The remnants of a stone road emerge from the narrow pathway leading to the southwest, only to disappear once again into the waters of a cold, languid stream.  Cutting its way through the tall surrounding wall of reeds, the stream disappears to the north, while dispersing into several fast moving rivulets to the south.  Dark, elongated shapes move beneath the surface of the water, vanishing and emerging from shadows in the stream."
