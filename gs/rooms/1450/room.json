      "Lush green grass spreads out around you, encompassing the white painted building that sits in the center of the lawn.  Wildflowers speckle the ground, adding a variety of colors to the scenery.  A small path cuts across the lawn to a small set of stairs leading up to the building's door.  Children run over the lawn as a few parents stand nearby with a keen eye.",

Pale moonlight drifts lazily over the quiet courtyard as a few crickets chirrup nearby."
