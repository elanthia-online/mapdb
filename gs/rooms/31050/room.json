      "Whitewashed walls and rainbow-whorled windows dominate the tidy room, while a painted panoramic of Solhaven, complete with street names and shop fronts, sprawls across the polished floor.  Preserved flower samples housed in tiny glass frames are arranged upon either side of a tall bookshelf, their buff faces reflecting the various titles of the tomes held on each shelf.  A pristine white pedestal also occupies the space, though it has been carefully moved out of the path of foot traffic."
