    "description": [
      "The pathway between houses descends steeply toward a finger of land protruding from the palisade out into the unforgiving waters of the Frostmain.  To one side of the road stands a wooden hut with a thatched roof of long-dried grass that has caved in, undone by the weight of snowfall.  Blankets and clothing are strewn before the steps of the hut, unmoving save when they are tugged by an errant breeze."
