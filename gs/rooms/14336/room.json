      "The room is dominated by a huge marble statue to the west, set upon a raised platform of white washed stone.  Dark paneled walls reflect the moonlight cascading down from an open skylight in the high vaulted ceiling onto the base of the statue.  A thick burgundy drape cleverly conceals an alcove across from the statue and some long blue silk curtains offer passage to the south, back to the inn proper.",
