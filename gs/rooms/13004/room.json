      "The hollowed-out stump of a huge, ancient pine tree pokes through the top of the layer of fog covering the ground here.  Inside the stump, wood pulp provides sustenance to a variety of mushrooms and thousands of insects burrow busily through the decaying wood.  The ground near the stump is soft, indicating that the roots of the once-magnificent tree are also decaying away."
