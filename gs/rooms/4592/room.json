      "Flanking both sides of the gilded doorway are two sets of immaculate suits of armor.  One of the sets wears a helmet that greatly resembles the head of a bird, and the other holds a wickedly barbed mace in both gauntleted fists.  Cerulean carpeting spreads from wall-to-wall and a low oval-shaped glass cabinet containing an ancient map is surrounded by an assortment of seashells and sand."
