      "Layers of tonal red linen panels compose the airy canopy and walls of this pavilion while a simple cotton rug covers most of the dirt floor.  Next to the entrance, a small incense holder releases a mixture of cinnamon and clove, giving the room a subtle, warm scent.  Above, lit glass lanterns are suspended from the rosewood crossbeams and provide a soft, steady glow over a glass display case, its contents displayed on a delicate glass shelf."
