      "Cozy and intimate, the walls of this small space are covered in dark green brocade silk.  A chandelier dangling green and white cut crystals throws dancing shards of light over the plush black fur rug and grey marble fireplace.  A soft green velvet couch and an oversized white velvet lounge are arranged around a sleek silver table inlaid with moss agate."
