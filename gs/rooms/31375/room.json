      "Huge stone walls and ramparts stretch along the area, comprising the northern fortifications of Gallardshold.  Armored imperial soldiers march the length of the stone battlements, their eyes always trained to the distance.  To the south and east, the fortress city expands, while a narrow trail bends north into an expanse of trees."
