      "Mist grey walls encompass this small room where a mountainous diorama takes up one corner.  Across the walls, stylized crimson raindrops fall toward a white marble floor where red streaks in the stone resemble rivulets of blood in the snow.  Two silver-framed paintings hang on the wall opposite the diorama, with matching plaques to describe them.  Everything is bathed in the light of several flickering torches that dot the walls.",
