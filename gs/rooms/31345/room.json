      "Nestled within the spacious triangle formed by two massive roots and a curtain of hanging moss, this cloistered corner is still and quiet, the protective vegetation guarding against wind and dampening sounds.  Along each side runs a parallel blackened cedar bench, providing a comfortable place to relax in the flickering light cast by several torches illuminating this hideaway under the ancient and majestic tree.  A live edge sliced teak table supported by three slender legs is at the center of it all, resting on a bed of plush moss that covers the ground."
