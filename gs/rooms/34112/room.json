      "The tent's center pole rises twice the height of a tall giantman, while the outer canvas walls are roughly two-thirds as high.  Displayed around the perimeter are lengths of wool cloth in a variety of colorful tartans.  A large table occupies the center of the room, its surface cluttered with sewing implements, cloth remnants, and a few unfinished garments."
