      "The plank walkway gives way to solid stone several paces before a pair of inlaid bronze doors.  Easily thrice the height of a man, the doors are paneled with solid jade that has been etched with bas-reliefs.  The torches closest to the entrance burn a vile shade of yellow-green and trail oily smoke, lending an unhealthy cast to the surroundings."
