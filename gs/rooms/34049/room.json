      "Ornate gold and silver inlay arcs outward in splendorous rays from a pair of double doors in the western wall.  Above the keystone, a crowned cockatrice is picked out in brilliant gilding, its claws outstretched.  Chandeliers of tremendous size hang from the ceiling high overhead, forged from golvern and glaes, holding thousands of beeswax candles aloft.  The air is gently honeyed by their scent, a testament to their number despite the vastness of the hall."
