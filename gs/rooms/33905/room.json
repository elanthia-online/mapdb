      "Lacquered cherrywood beams cross along the ceiling, entwined with leafy garlands of alabaster naefira caught in bloom, the flora encircling silk-wrapped faerthiel suspended above a marble counter.  Chiseled marble pillars frame the wall-affixed wooden shelves stained a hunter green, the planks displaying tall glass jars filled with dried leaves mixed with blossoms and herbs.  Ianthine travertine tiles are arranged in a checkerboard pattern across the floor, inset in dark ivory flourishes."
