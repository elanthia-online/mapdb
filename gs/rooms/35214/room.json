      "Shelves line the walls, each one filled to capacity by soft, furry toy pumas, wildcats and penguins.  A family of toy bears sits at a small table, as if patiently awaiting their tea and tarts.  Near the arch is a bin heaped with stuffed toy monkeys, their tiny black eyes glittering mischievously."
