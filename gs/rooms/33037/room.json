      "Bright sunlight floods the room through a tall mullioned window, illuminating the antique silk rug covering most of the tiled floor.  Three grey stone walls, hung with pastoral murals, enclose the space beneath a high vaulted ceiling, while a curved linden balustrade overlooks the hall below.  Tall cabinets filled with books and curios line one wall, in front of which sits a writing desk and a high-backed chair.  Two sofas face each other across a low table set for entertaining.",
