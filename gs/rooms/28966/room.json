      "Cobalt blue rugs cover the floor from wall to wall in the small lounge, while pendant-shaped globes dangle from copper chains in the ceiling and create a soft, twilight-hued light that suffuses the air.  Several quilted armchairs are scattered about the space, some in groups of two and three and others angled for the solitary visitor.  Shimmering energy dances within a cinquefoil archway, the static electricity rising out of it preventing anyone from entering, though nothing seems to be blocking an enruned golden arch."
