    "description": [
      "A circle of charred rocks surrounding half-burnt logs marks the location of a recent cookout in the shade of the overhead pier.  Coconut crab shells, now empty of their previous inhabitants, have been discarded in scattered piles upon the pebbled sand.  Stripes of sunlight paint the ground where gaps in the wooden pier walkway lets slivers of golden rays shine through."
