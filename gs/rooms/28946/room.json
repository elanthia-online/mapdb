    "description": [
      "A colorfully-painted carved ship's figurehead styled as a happy sea hag welcomes one and all into this rustic yet upscale inn and tavern.  Woven ropes of fresh-cut flowers decorate the salvaged figurehead and fill the entry with the pleasant scent of hibiscus and ivy, mingling with ocean salt.  A polite murmur of carousing wafts in from the other side of some double doors to the west."
