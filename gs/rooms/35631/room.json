      "Shafts of sunlight filter through gaps in the high canopy, dappling everything in green-golden hues.  One patch of warmth reveals the crumbling edge of a cyclopean stone wall, part of a huge ruined edifice partially reclaimed by the jungle.  Most of the visible wall has been devoured by thorny vines that are heavy with trumpet-shaped periwinkle blooms.  Ornate pillars about its perimeter are etched with faded glyphs, and mosses in a variety of colors carpet broken stone tiles underfoot."
