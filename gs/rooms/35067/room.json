      "A scrimshander's shop sits along the gloomy row.  Carved whalebone chimes hung from the shop's eaves clatter almost musically in the driving wind, filling the quiet span of roadway with their hollow percussion.  Before the entrance stands a statue of a merrow carved entirely from a whale's mandible.  The creature's scaled body is intricately tattooed with cobalt blue ink."
