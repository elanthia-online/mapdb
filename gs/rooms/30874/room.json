      "Four thick boards edge the floor, creating a box in the center of the room.  Neatly trimmed grass grows inside the large square, providing a uniform, green flooring.  Centered on the turf, a low teak table sits with various office accoutrements scattered atop it.  Two hexagonal slate tiles sit between the entryway and the front of the table, protecting the grass from visitor's feet.  A woven reed mat rests on the other side of the table, providing a clean spot to sit and work."
