      "Strips of tartan in numerous styles and colors are sewn haphazardly together and backed by worn leather to form the walls of this slightly tattered but reasonably cozy tent.  A bedroll is pushed into a corner, and strips of sinew and suede criss-cross the tent's ceiling, creating a makeshift rack from which several pouches, fetishes, and talismans dangle."
