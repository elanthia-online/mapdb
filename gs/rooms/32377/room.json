      "Crisp is the breeze, brined heavily with the salt of the ocean, as it scours the lowlands.  The trailway ascends through a patch of ruddy scrub toward a small slope.  Rudimentary attempts to line the path with gravel seem to have ended in defeat, leaving behind loose, skittering stones that hinder progress more than help it."
