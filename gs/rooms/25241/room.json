      "Long beds of dark loam stretch to either side of the walk, filling the air with a damply fresh smell.  This is accompanied by undertones of another odor, sweeter and fouler, that of rot run rampant.  Greying limbs breach up from the earthen depths, planted there as if in grisly parody of a garden, grasping and twitching and never tiring."
