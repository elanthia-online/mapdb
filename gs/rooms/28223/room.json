      "Located beneath street level, the cool ambient temperature of the cavern is perfect for the storage of wine.  The space is dimly lit by a series of indigo-glazed brass lanterns hanging from the low-vaulted ceiling.  Silvery blue light illuminates a series of wine racks lining the bare stone walls and a stack of pale linden crates.  The air is filled with the musty odor of dust and hint of acrid smoke."
