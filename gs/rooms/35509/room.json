      "A yellow glow illuminates the room from a small lamp suspended from a massive beam high above.  Several large crates labeled \"SUGAR\" are stacked neatly against one another along one side of the room.  Cobwebs have formed in a back corner where a collection of onions and potatoes are stacked against another wall.  On a tall wooden shelf, you can see countless bags of various grains, rice, and beans.  A tall sack rests on the ground, its contents of turnips spilling out."
