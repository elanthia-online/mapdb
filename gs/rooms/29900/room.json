      "The dirt roadway proceeds beneath a monumental arch of white granite, the surface of which is roughly carved with an arcing spray of runes.  Holly climbs the base pillars, its bright red berries a stark contrast to the pallor of the stone.  Beyond, smoke rises from the high roofs of buildings made from raw timber and rough-hewn stone.  All of the buildings are several times the height of a tall man."
