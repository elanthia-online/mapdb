      "In the center of this spacious foyer is a claw-footed gnarled oak pedestal, prominently featured amongst the drab surroundings of scratched oak flooring and the dull red velvet tapestries which cover every wall.  A rough woolen carpet is set in front of the maple door leading into the ballroom."
