      "A garden trail leads up and west away from this exquisite open-air amphitheatre, and marble and silverwood terraced benches are broken into thirds by stairs.  Framing the stage is a dragon, its tail curling around the nearby orchestra pit and the spine rising against the backdrop of glistening waters beyond.  A small, velvet-roped walkway leads to elegant pews at the front, protected from the elements by argent tenting."
