    "description": [
      "The cobblestone road wanders through a contorted landscape, both overgrown and nearly dead at the same time.  Blackened, woody vines replete with long, jagged thorns and sickly grey leaves parallel the road as if examining it for potential victims.  Here and there trees battle for survival among the choking underbrush, but the stunted appearance of the trees indicate that the battle is difficult.  Several trees, merely large stumps now, indicate that the battle is often lost."
