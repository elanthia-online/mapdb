      "Curving from the north to the west, an impassible line of natural monoliths glisten wetly in the moonlight.  Nighttime shadows enshroud the small area of relatively calm water the monoliths create, enhancing the darkness of the liquid.  Several hundred limpets cling to each of the tall, unmoving sentinels, their shells resembling a collection of rocks at the bottom of a stream."
