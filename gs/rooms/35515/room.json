      "[Craggy Rock Approach]"

    "description": [
      "Rough walls, etched with deep grooves, jagged edges, and uneven outcrops form a curved tunnel that leads through the thick rock.  Patches of encrusting algae, barnacles, and sponges cling to the stone, filling crevices and cracks.  Sections of the ceiling dip low, forcing a tighter passage, while sudden openings reveal hidden alcoves within the stone.  The passage twists and narrows unpredictably, its rough, weathered surfaces shaped by the steady flow of the sea."
