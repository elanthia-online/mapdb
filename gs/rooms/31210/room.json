      "The ceiling of this mystical chamber is a huge open dome of paneled glass.  The walls, also of glass, are covered in leafy vines of climbing ivy.  Centered in the room is a magnificent silver dragon, head held high, with eyes containing unimaginable knowledge.  A closer look shows the beast actually to be a large telescope, aimed directly into the sky.  Nearby is an old wooden table, heaped with astrological charts, scrolls, and other instruments of discovery.",
