      "A raised stone platform carved into a circle bridges the final expanse between sandbar and atoll to the north.  The water churns maliciously about the platform, breaking across the basalt sides to form white-capped waves that froth back and forth before eventually calming.  A deep rumbling can be heard in the distance, with no source in sight.",
