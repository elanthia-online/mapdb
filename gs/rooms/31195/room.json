      "Strung from the willow wood supports that dominate the curved ceiling, frosted orbs create a soft but powerful illumination that is pristine and white.  Paints, brushes, and pincushions fill the various baskets that are tucked beneath nearby display tables, which are in turn pushed against the canvas walls.  Forming a trail that spreads to the west, a row of fire hardened gourd vessels is filled with tiny items for purchase."
