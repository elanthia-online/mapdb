      "Several tables skirted in various colors and festooned with multicolored ribbons fill the large clearing.  Wooden trays heaped with food cover a central stand.  Ribbons of silvery moonlight filter through the thick verdant canopy of several large oak trees growing tall along the edge of the meadow."
