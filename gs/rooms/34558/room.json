      "The edges of the crevice affording access to this cramped space are blackened and singed as if some manner of heat contributed to its formation, though the tree's interior is left unscathed.  Perfumed with the scent of clean sap, the air is slightly humid without being uncomfortable, and occasionally, a thin wisp of a breeze trickles through to stir and refresh the air.  In the center of the chamber is a makeshift tree trunk table topped with a rough-hewn oak tray, while behind it stands a wooden half-moon shelf."
