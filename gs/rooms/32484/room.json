      "Jewels of multifarious hues encrust a sphere suspended from the ceiling, casting a prismatic storm of colors over the cold features of an aged bone statue.  The figure stands atop a raised dais draped in black velvet, the pooling spills of which look almost liquid in the radiance.  Behind her, a mural on the wall depicts a vast black gate with only shadows beyond."
