      "As the tunnel splits into three different directions, the luminous slab floor creates a glowing 'Y' in the gloom.  Overhead, the surface of the ceiling stone is as irregular as the tiled floor is smooth.  The deep pocks and crevices within the rock there are occasionally populated with small pairs of glowing eyes, which blink and stare a moment before abruptly disappearing into the darkness."
