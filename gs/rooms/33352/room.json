      "Small ceramic herb jars and miniature plants line the back edge of the dark modwir counter, parting to make room for a dented enamel wash basin positioned beneath a circular brass porthole window.  A small cookstove is nestled in a fixture of smoothed river stones.  Three round wooden stools sit under the counter, available for seating as needed.  A trio of colorful crab shells are mounted on the walls, within the grasp of a huge shark jaw."
