      "This hallway is stunningly decorated with a mural of silver beaten into the glossy black walls and ceiling.  The scene depicts a fantastic battle of great dragons and powerful Ur'Daemon, each figure a silver silhouette on a field of obsidian.  Several torches mounted on the walls burn with a strange blue flame, sending an eerie glow of scintillating light reflecting across the room."
