      "The tunnel twists and turns, its passageway cloaked with shadows and clouds of low-lying fog, which float along the floor like a ghostly river.  Outcroppings of stone emerge from the rounded walls like contorted creatures seeking to escape their imprisonment within the rock.  No drafts of air are evident, although the fog roils into eddies and curls at the urging of some undetectable force."
