      "Pale grey paints transform the ceiling from misty uncertainty to the west into a bright blue sky in the east.  Warm yellow hues fill the aisles with golden light that descends from blown glass orbs that are suspended from the rafters.  Gossamer drapery of wispy white flutter as the ambient air slips through the area, their ends occasionally catching on the weapon racks and their display of wares."
