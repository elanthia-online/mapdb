    "description": [
      "Settled high up on a trumpet tree's branches, the occasionally present aracari picks at his ebony feathers, simultaneously showing off his brilliant yellowed chest striped over once with a collar of crimson.  Green jungle closes in from all sides, save for the cleared area to one direction, where an open-faced hut is readily visible.  Rough, muddy paths of scattered footprints lead in several directions, and humidity sits in the air, obviously a comfortable friend of the jungle.",

Green jungle closes in from all sides, save for the cleared area to one direction, where an open-faced hut is readily visible.  Rough, muddy paths of scattered footprints lead in several directions, and humidity sits in the air, obviously a comfortable friend of the jungle."
