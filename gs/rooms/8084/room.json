      "To the east stands the ruins of an old peel, its splintered doorway toothlessly agape.  The massive rock walls must have provided great protection at one time, before something or someone reduced the tower to its present state.  Enough of the tower remains to easily dominate the nearby area, the jagged top of it snapping hungrily at the sky."
