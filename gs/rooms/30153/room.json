      "Set along the east side of the expansive room is a pair of arched windows flanking a central set of nearly identical arched double doors.  Sunlight spills across the dark-stained mahogany floor, embracing an expansive cedar wardrobe.  Centered between a pair of lor nightstands, a cushioned back-panel bed rests against the wall opposite an elaborate fireplace.  Twin caramel-hued couches surround a modest oval glass table atop a rectangular dark ochre and ivory rug near the fireplace.",
