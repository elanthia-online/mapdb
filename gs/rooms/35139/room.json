      "Lush black velvet carpet with teal silk tassels mutes the clack of footsteps over the stones of the hall.  Along the walls hang purloined artworks, from bland elven watercolors to the bold oil paintings of Turamzzyrian virtuosos.  The sea of artistry parts for a paneled mahogany door, over which hangs a pair of crossed cutlasses forged from gold."
