      "Featuring a huge old sycamore tree, this section of the courtyard has been festooned with multiple mismatched banners.  Benches have been placed under the expansive tree in what appears to be an attempt at hospitality.  If one could ignore the malodourous ambiance and muddy straw-covered ground, this would be a nice place to rest."
