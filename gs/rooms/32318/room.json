      "The meadow stretches over an expanse of hilly terrain that seems to grow less flat to the north and west as the land rises away from one of the river's smaller forks.  Wildflowers are plentiful, colluding with the abundant grasses, verdant green and vibrantly red, to clash with the greys and whites in the distance.  Far to the northeast, the Sleeping Ladies are clad in snows and crowned with clouds."
