    "description": [
      "The jungle canopy deteriorates as towering giants give way to shorter trees stunted by the winds sweeping over the trailway as it climbs toward higher ground.  Opportunistic stands of bamboo thrive in the open air, their slender, knobbed stalks colluding to craft a nearly impassable wall along the eastern verges of the path.  The breeze sets the bamboo to gentle swaying, soliciting a softly creaking symphony that echoes quietly through the thinning jungle."
