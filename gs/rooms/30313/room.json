      "Ramshackle and rickety, the small shop smells of dust and mildew.  Dirty oak floors creak whether someone is moving across them or not, and the grimy windows cause even the smoky lanterns that light the area to seem dim and ineffective.  Open crates rest before a long oak-paneled counter, both housing wares that seem out of place in this back-alley structure."
