    "description": [
      "Large bay windows overlook a wooded ravine behind the cottage, allowing in what glimpses of daylight are permitted by the abounding woods.  The cottage's sitting room is tidy and its air is perfumed heavily with the herbal scent of fresh tea.  A pair of divans upholstered in hunter green velvet sit opposite one another, while a small thanot writing desk nestled in one corner is stacked with neatly ordered papers."
