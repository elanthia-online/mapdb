      "Urns and skulls line rough-edged niches in the walls pressing in on the tall, narrow tunnelway.  One skull, dislodged from its resting place, stares up from the earth, its sockets empty and accusatory.  The ground is rough and uneven, cratered where loose stones have been pried free by passersby."
