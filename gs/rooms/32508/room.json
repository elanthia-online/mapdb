      "Scissor trusses made of dark monir run parallel along the ceiling, creating a vaulted roof to this vast room.   An annular chandelier composed of various antlers dangles from the center of the space and competes for the focal point of the area against a cobblestone fireplace.  Trophies of hunts from the past decorate the paneled blue walls, their lifeless expressions still holding their ferocity.  A petrified tree stump sideboard runs along the back of cognac leather couches that occupy the floor."
