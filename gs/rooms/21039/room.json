    "description": [
      "Giant fern fronds overlap the narrow trail, while heavy vines dangle low from the treetops, obscuring the path ahead and making movement in this area slow and difficult.  A hazy mist creeps along the muddy ground, disappearing into the heavy undergrowth filled with ferns and flowering shrubs.  The songs of wild birds fill the air from the canopy of trees high above, mingled with the occasional cry of some unknown creature."
