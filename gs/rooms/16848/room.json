      "Detailed busts of notable dwarves and their beards rest upon a simple ledge that runs the length of the far wall.  Beside a cushioned, steel-framed chair, a polished marble stand supports a shiny metal tray neatly lined with an assortment of grooming tools.  The chamber is cast in a cheerful light by the glowing toadstools situated at each corner."
