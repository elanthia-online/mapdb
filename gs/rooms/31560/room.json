      "Teeming with fragrant, herbaceous growth, an overgrown garden tumbles across a cobbled pathway that departs from the crooked street toward a barely visible, squat cottage.  Thin ribbons of smoke slip from the off-center chimney to disappear in the aura-tinted sky.  Its nearest neighbor, a small confections shop, is festooned with colorful lights and pennants that create a festive air."
