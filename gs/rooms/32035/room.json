      "The last vestiges of a dwindling fire sits between a pair of tall crumbling buildings, the dying coals giving off the occasional spark that is instantly drowned out by the encroaching darkness.  The faint cries of an unknown mammal echo off the stone walls, drowned out by the hissing of the subsiding fire."
