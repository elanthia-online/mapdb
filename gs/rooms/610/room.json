      "The few elves passing through this quiet neighborhood carry home parcels from late night purchases at the various shops and warehouses that line the darkened var.  On the southeast corner of this intersection, a low building with mica-flecked granite pillars beckons shoppers through wide double doors.  Through large bay windows, you can see a variety of home furnishings illuminated by glowing oil lamps.",
