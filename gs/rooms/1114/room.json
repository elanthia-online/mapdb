      "The presence of the trees modifies the dryness as the trees release moisture into the air.  The maples and elms appear quite healthy and fully covered with leaves.  Their trunks tell a slightly different story, though.  Twisting and stunting indicate that these trees have had to weather very dry years when the waters of the creek have dissipated totally, but right now they enjoy full health and the surrounding area benefits from their vigor.",
