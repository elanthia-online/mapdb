      "Industrious spiders have worked their magic in this shadowy path.  Delicate spider-silk art drapes the graceful willows like a bridal veil.  An impressive web has been spun across a gated entrance to a small green discouraging any visitors.  Bubbling softly in the middle of the park is an obsidian fountain.  A liveried servant leans on his broom as he takes a break from keeping the arachnid artists at bay."
