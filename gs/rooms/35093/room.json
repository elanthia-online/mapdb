      "Standing tall and broad enough that its shoulders scrape the walls of the shrine, an unlovely bronze statue of a scarred krolvin warrior stands atop a plinth of blood red stone.  He leers at a twisted steel altar forged together from swords and daggers, their still-sharp tips jutting cruelly from the fused mass.  Incense smoke hangs on the close air in stinging drifts, smelling of laurel and bloodwood."
