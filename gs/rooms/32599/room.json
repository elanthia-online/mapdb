      "Moonlight streams in through the clear crystal ceiling, casting long shadows across the rosewood floor towards the pulpit centered at the front of the room, the platform set before several pews.  Silver sconces frame tapestries across the chapel walls, the light sparkling across them like stars in the evening sky.  Soft murmurs of prayer and singing echo throughout the chamber, the sounds reverberating against a rosewood table by the onyx staircase, the table half-cast in shadow."
