      "The interior of the hut was once a sizeable single room with an earthen hearth and a curtain delineating a bedchamber with a frame and overstuffed mattress full of goat wool stuffing.  The curtain has been slashed, and the copper cookwares are scattered across the ground, twisted into unrecognizable shapes.  The smell of dried iceblossoms, sweetly herbal, lingers amid the destruction."
