      "Slanting at an absurd angle, the roof of the shop is attached on the eastern edge to a wall that is two fomorians high, while barely tall enough for a coblynau to the west.  Diagrams and building plans decorate the walls, each with a corresponding note or label stating \"Dream Home\" or \"Wishes\" in a bright green calligraphy.  Access to windows is blocked by the various towering bookcases that line the walls, though the floor is largely free of debris.",
