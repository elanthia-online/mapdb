      "The stars move slowly across the clear sky, twinkling brilliantly, but providing no warmth.  The uncovered soil makes it much more difficult to note the tracks of predators and prey alike, as the frozen ground gives no indication of their passing.  Only occasionally, in the snow piled up against boulders or in sheltered flat patches, do the prints appear.  Sometimes one type is alone, sometimes two types are together, and sometimes one type suddenly ends entirely.",
