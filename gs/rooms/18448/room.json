      "Several stalks of rhubarb lie at the edge of the field, pulled up from the ground and then abandoned next to their holes.  Their stringy roots splay out from pale crimson stalks, which are firm and glossy.  Stuck upright in the ground, several child-sized trowels are visible further in the field."
