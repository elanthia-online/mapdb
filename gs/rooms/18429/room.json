      "Set slightly off the main road leading through town, this rounded cul-de-sac has just enough room for a wagon to enter and turn around to exit.  A small house with a thatched roof and wood-framed windows is nestled at the rear, and a small hitching post is planted near its door.  Both of the front windows are open to the air, the ruffled hems of their white curtains visible."
