      "A ring of black candles is evenly spaced in a circle at the edges of the tent, casting even but insufficient light over the interior.  Flickering, feeble luminescence plays over the edges of a polished altar of blue stone at the tent's center, its edges adorned with ornate carved scrollwork.  Heat from a steel brazier atop a heavy stone block holds back a chill in the air."
