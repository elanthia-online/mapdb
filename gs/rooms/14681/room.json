      "Comfortably furnished, this guest room is a small suite in itself.  Rich burgundy carpet and curtains are highlighted by the white plastered walls.  A large canopied bed rests against the west wall, covered with a quilted coverlet and a ruffled bed-skirt.  A small writing desk rests on the north wall complete with lightly scented note paper, an ink-well and a quill pen.  At the window, two comfortable chairs sit next to a small table with a small bouquet of fragrant herbs freshening the air."
