      "The smoky, torchlit passage splits to either side of a grand staircase of grey stone and deep crimson bloodwood that ascends grandiosely to the second story of the keep.  There, upper banisters fly banners in scarlet and grey.  A framed archway to the northwest reveals glimpses of long shelves crowded with old tomes, while a mirroring path to the northeast dovetails into a spectacular gallery hung with a dazzling selection of artworks."
