      "The lofty open-beamed ceiling provides a glimpse of the second floor newsroom, visible just beyond a sturdy mahogany railing.  Sunlight filters through twin palladian windows flanking the entry, refracting through crystalline glass panes to wash the narrow tanik floorboards.  Opposite the entry doors, a polished mahogany reception counter holds an assortment of refreshments and a small handwritten card.  A twining grapevine fresco follows some curved steps ascending to the open space above."
