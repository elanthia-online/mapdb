    "description": [
      "Thin rays of sunlight seep through the alternating linden and mahogany slats framing the windows of the shop, the beams highlighting the wall-mounted rack of garments dyed in a variety of rich-colored tones.  Silk-stitched dress forms stand at the corners of the limestone room, the silhouettes bedecked in handwoven garlands of florals interspersed by verdant ferns.  The carved pine counter sits at the center of the pyrographed floor, its surface draped in leaf-framed naefira."
