      "Shattered wooden panels and the collapsed trunk of a fallen oak lie across the path, slowly decaying amidst the vine-like creepers of the forest floor.  Once a tree house of some size, the jagged remains of wooden walls and flooring lie intermixed with the cracked branches, torn bark and dead leaves of the tree which once held it.  The old trunk, although showing signs of dry rot and termite infestation, appears to have contracted some form of disease, for its bark has turned a pale grey.",
