    "description": [
      "Shaded by stands of bloodwood that mostly obscure sight of the walls and entry arch, the yard is an expanse of spongy, reddish soil punctuated with red anemones and delicate violet iris.  A small stream flows through the wooded grounds, but it has an unsavory hue and flavors with the air with the bitter tang of copper.  Flagstones so darkly red as to appear black wind sinuously toward the steps of a ruddy stone ziggurat flanked by a quartet of spindly minarets, each crowned with a two-headed serpent."
