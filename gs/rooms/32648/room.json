      "A wide gelatinous mass adheres to the ceiling, its pseudopods extending down the corridors to the northwest, northeast, southeast and southwest.  The mass pulsates rapidly, and with each pulsation blue electrical discharges streak down each pseudopod to light the room, the adjacent corridors, and beyond.  Here, near the center of the pulsations, the room is brilliantly but painfully illuminated with each strobe of the crackling, electrical energy."
