      "The ebb and flow of the surf is but a distant whisper, having ceded ground to the music of alpine birdsong and the susurrus of cold wind through the alpine meadows.  Mountains loom in the northeast, the jagged volcanic peaks a study in opposites.  Some are black shadows in the night, but one, taller than the rest, weeps a constant flow of lava as if its peak were an open wound.  Even in the night, it is bathed balefully in the infernal light of its seething lava flows."
