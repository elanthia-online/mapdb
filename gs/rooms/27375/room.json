      "The open, hay-strewn floor of the stable stretches from one end of the building to the other, running between many box stalls.  Hanging from hooks, racks, and various shelves along the walls are matters of tack and barding, and a small anteroom hosts far more storage for feed, tools, and armor.  A hayloft looms above, with bales of hay stacked alongside some barrels at the base of its ladder, and the occasional snorts and whinnies of horses create a subdued din in the air as they shift in their stalls."
