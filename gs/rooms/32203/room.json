      "Whilst the rest of the Hall seems to have fallen into disrepair, this small chamber remains pristine.  A figured green silk rug covers much of the flagstone floor, and mirrors, their surfaces clear and unfoxed, cover the walls.  The greedy position of a heavily cushioned chair nearly conceals a petite fireplace, with its surround of gilded wood.  Lesser benches, with less comfortable cushions and less access to the heat, are placed in a half-circle.  A single gilded door provides the only egress."
