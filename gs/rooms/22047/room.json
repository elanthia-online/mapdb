      "In the center of the room a gorgeous brass filigree swing sways slightly. The glass of a large bay window reflects a rosewood bedroom set, a beautiful painting hung over a polished marble fireplace and a breathtaking, solid silver puma which lounges on a bearskin rug. In one corner an antique table is covered with items used for mixing potions. You note several pairs of worn, mismatched bootlaces, and a wand for bubble making peeking out of an ancient elven fishing kreel."
