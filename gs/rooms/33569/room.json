      "Laid out in layers, bright white rugs rest upon grass green ones to create diamond patterns upon the ground, while heavy wrought iron spheres rest upon the overly long cloth walls in an attempt to keep the arctic winds at bay.  A narrow wooden footlocker rests in the center of the room, its lid thrown back to reveal the trinkets and baubles stored within.  Not far behind, a long oak table has several river reed baskets stuffed under it, which helps to clear up the center for foot traffic."
