      "Wall sconces housing hurricane lanterns line the walls of the hut, providing ample illumination for the crowded space and dispelling all shadows from the area.  Long shelving units are hung between the lanterns, their sides open ended, and their wall supports fashioned of heavy wrought iron.  A series of parchment advertisements decorate the spaces beneath the shelves, their painted faces cheery and bright."
