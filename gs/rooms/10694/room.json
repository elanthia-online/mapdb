      "A breach in the outer wall opens up onto a small trail that heads towards a thick stand of trees.  Rubble is strewn throughout the area, most of it inside the walls, now a hazard to those walking through the area.  A rusted iron chain spans the breach in the wall, its purpose not readily apparent.",
