      "The road climbs gently to match the rise and fall of the land, flanked on either side by stands of starkly yellow tamarack that ceases to grow several paces from the road's edge.  Off to the side of the road, a leather pack sized for a halfling is stuck in a snow bank that has frozen solid.  The pack seems undamaged and undisturbed, but it is firmly lodged where it fell, the leather twined with fingers of rime."
