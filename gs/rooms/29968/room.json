      "Within niches along the walls slumber dozens of gigas corpses, clad still in the decaying remains of ancient burial attire: horned helms mottled with rust and armors that are more mold than leather.  Roots from above have grown down into the bodies in their blind search for sustenance, and some niches are choked entirely with the questing tendrils of the vast trees far above the subterranean catacomb.  A shattered drinking horn lies at the base of one rough wall, its shards aglisten in the moist air."
