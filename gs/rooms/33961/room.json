      "Dirty shop windows allow the aurora-patterned sky to filter into the area, dusting the low shelves in mottled hues of violet and cerulean.  Dampness hangs heavy in the air, the scent of sea water and mold dominating the space, while a chill mist clings to the warped floorboards.  A series of display cases filled with dried seaweed are scattered throughout the space, each bearing a patina of verdigris on their damp copper fixtures."
