      "The circular arrangement of standing stones scratches at the sky with tips worn smooth by the constant assault of wind and snow.  Each of the standing stones is inlaid with a stylized jag of copper lightning.  Mist pools in the center of the vast circle, strangely luminous in the aurora's dancing light.  Its eddies caress the base of a wide, flat altar carved with a pattern of draconic scales, the surface stained and matted with bits of pale fur that leave little doubt as to its purpose."
