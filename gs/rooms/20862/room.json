      "The scents of sweat and oil fill the air.  Gambesons and padded shirts hang over the ends of the bunks that line the walls.  Between the beds, racks are filled with every manner of weapon, gleaming and ready for immediate use.  At the far end of the room, rows of dark leather armor perch on stands, each with a shield hanging behind it from a hook in the wall.  Next to the door, a large workbench sits, with tools and whetstones arranged on it.",
      "The scents of sweat and oil fill the air.  Gambesons and padded shirts hang over the ends of the bunks that line the walls.  Blood-stained war banners and a few rather grisly trophies hang from the ceiling, in mute testimony to the prowess of the warriors that reside here."
