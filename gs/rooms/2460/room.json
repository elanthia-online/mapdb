      "A riotous throng crowds the entrance of a large grey tent with a ten-foot long rat tail on top.  Standing atop a wooden crate, a halfling rogue dressed in fine grey leathers stands in front of a sign depicting a wheel of cheese.  Paying little mind to the untenable size of the crowd that his establishment has already amassed, he exhorts passerby to come closer, only adding to the horde.",
      "A crowd gathers here, circling a shouting halfling rogue dressed in fine leathers.  Standing atop a wooden crate, the halfling's cries of \"Rat bets! All the odds you need to know! And some you don't!\" ring out through the crisp air."
