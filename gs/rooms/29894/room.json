      "Near the collapsed mouth of a great burrow in the ground lays the corpse of an immense scaled worm.  The creature's scales are a rich blue like a summer sky at midday, but they have largely been cut away in the work of butchering the great beast.  Segments of flesh are missing, revealing shining white bone underneath.  The hardness of the scales and the toughness of the creature's meat are evident in the wear on a pile of huge notched axes lying, frozen over, to one side of the carcass."
