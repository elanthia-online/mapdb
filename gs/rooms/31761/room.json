      "Curtains of grandpa's beard moss drape smaller tree species with their scraggly stems, slowly descending into pendant shapes that brush the rocky terrain with their curly ends.  Burning brightly in a small clearing off the edge of the path, a bonfire covered with a cauldron-strung dried oak tripod dispels the dark of the woods.  Nearly luminous in the firelight, peat moss blankets those trees untouched by its loftier cousin and is home to stepping stones that connect several huts lurking in the forest's miasma to the path."
