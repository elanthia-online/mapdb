      "The wooden planks of the dock creak loudly, their surfaces stained with salt and swathed with glistening frost.  A maze of large krolvin warships stretches out into the murky waters, their figureheads carved into the ferocious images of various sea monsters.  The area is shrouded in a thick, icy fog that obscures several forms moving along the pier."
