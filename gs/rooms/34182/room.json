    "description": [
      "Nearly overwhelming the narrow, natural chamber, a monolith of blue labradorite surges up from the rocky floor to crest against the ceiling, its presence deflecting the adjoining hewn tunnels at an acute angle.  Frothy formations of silvery galena cling to the iridescent pillar at its apex and spill outward, further reinforcing the impression of a waterfall in reverse.  Bands of phosphorescence ringing the stalactites above cast a wan illumination that refracts through the crystalline structures and ignites their inner fire."
