      "Sloping down from a dark stone tunnel, a narrow, cobbled path leads toward a dirt mound of a platform in the room's middle.  This platform is hard-packed and circular in shape, and is further sectioned off by a thick cording of ropes that runs along the platform's boundaries.  To one side, a prominent stone sign is sunk deep into the platform's dirt.  Opposite the path from the tunnel down to the mound, a second cobbled path rises toward a broad stone arch deeper into the grotto."
