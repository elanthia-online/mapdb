      "A steep set of stone steps arrives from above, hugging the wall and curving to rest on the circular stone floor.  Although the walls shimmer with rainbow flecks, the main attraction is on the floor.  The center of the floor is perfectly flat and covered by a shimmering quartz mosaic.  The gems have been carefully cut and fitted so that, in the muted light, the mosaic appears almost as one solid gem, shifting from color to color.  A wooden black table laden with shiny trinkets sits beside a western passage."
