    "description": [
      "Shrouded in long grey-green lichen that drifts ghostlike in the humid air, tall cypresses surround a ruined shrine which is half-sunken in the brackish water.  The walls of the shrine are filthy, water-stained and cracked, but on the north wall, the remnants of a mosaic are visible.  A spotless alabaster altar stands in the center of the shrine.  Fresh muddy footprints, reeking of dead water and rotten eggs, lead to--but not from--the altar."
