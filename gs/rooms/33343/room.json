      "Terra cotta-colored walls complement pale sandstone tile floors in variegated neutral tones.  Muted moonlight gently illuminates a rosewood table through a latched garden window adorned with drawn ivory and sunset orange linen curtains.  Twin sconces cast dancing shadows upon an enameled iron stove set against a far wall adjacent to an intimate maoral booth tucked into the corner."
