      "Longhouses crowd together more closely near the center of the gigas settlement.  Several bonfires burn at meetings of the white stone paths that wind between the outsized buildings, holding back the oppressive twilight of the sunless sky.  Lit by the winding aurora, the houses are monstrous silhouettes that cast nebulous shadows over the path, their raw timber facades forbidding and tall."
