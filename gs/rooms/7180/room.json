      "The undergrowth from the woods to the east has taken over this part of the grounds.  Weeds grow up around grave markers that are nothing more than lashed-together sticks and branches, or piles of rocks.  The graves have been violated, left as humps of overturned earth from freshly dug to completely overgrown."
