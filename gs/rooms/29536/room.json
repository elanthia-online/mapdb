      "Raw cedar timbers perfume the air, comprising the walls of the expansive hall.  Living evergreen boughs contrast frame the southern entrance, brightly illuminated by faceted glimaerstone orbs set high into the ceiling.  The light scatters over a few dozen rows of comfortably padded seats and rugs covering parts of the polished floor.  A central aisle delineated by a quartet of braziers leads toward an expansive cedar and pine stage framed by silver-trimmed blue curtains."
