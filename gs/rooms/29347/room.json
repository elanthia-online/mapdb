      "Thin slats of bamboo line the walls of the shop, the pieces occasionally curtained by trails of citrus-scented incense emanating from around a crystalline open palm.  Atop a driftwood table, a blue-speckled orange enamel hibiscus lays next to an ivory-carved alligator bowl, the creature's eyes inset with faceted cabochons of citrine."
