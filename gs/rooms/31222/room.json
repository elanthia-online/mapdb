      "A comfortable-looking canopied bed covered in thick fleece blankets stands at the far end of this room.  To one side, a cozy fireplace is flush with the wall, the logs within waiting to crackle with a warm blaze.  On the mahogany bureau is a delicate porcelain vase containing a tiny bunch of fragrant, freshly-picked violets from the garden.  Two beautiful hand-crafted chairs lined with silk nestle by the wall."
