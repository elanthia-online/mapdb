      "Black iron chandeliers hang from thick chains suspended from the ceiling above, the wood covered with a dark stain and coated with a clear lacquer.  A trio of tables are placed about a large replica of an elven airship that is centered in the room.  Hung on the far wall is a pennant sewn from dark crimson silk and edged in golden fringe."
