    "description": [
      "For a place full of dead bones, the caverns are alive with noise.  Undertaker bat squeaks echo out of the gloom, mostly from the darkened ceiling.  Occasionally the sound of a bat's flapping passes from one direction to another as the creature flies through, unseen.  Shrieks, cries and moans emanate from the very pile of bones itself, the sounds reverberating off the walls and pillars to finally fade away in the distance.  It is a sheer cacophony of sound, and silence would be welcome."
