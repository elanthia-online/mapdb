      "Thick, ornate rugs depicting a colorful history of Icemule Trace layer the floors of the softly lit room.  A masterfully crafted spherical metal stove commands attention in the center of the area surrounded by some plush velvet pillows.  A woven manroot stalk bench sits opposite the curtain leading back to the reception.  An occasional shadow from the stove dances across the tent walls."
