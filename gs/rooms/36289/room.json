      "Several dozen crystal shards float just below the high ceiling, illuminating the space with a multicolored display of lights.  On the floor, four interlocking circles of runic designs form a triangular pattern, echoing the triskelion construction of the building.  The main wall is scribed in silver with carefully painted characters, each of which refracts the undulating light from above.  A floating glass table hovers near a rune-carved arch."
