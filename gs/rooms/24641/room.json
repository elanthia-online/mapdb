      "The front wall of the small square chamber is taken up by a narrow door and a single tracery window, which is paned in pale blue stained glass.  A matching silken rug covers the stone floor.  The counter that runs the length of the room is topped with a slab of labradorite, though a copious amount of dried wax covers its surface."
