      "Moss-encircled flagstones lead a sinuous path through the western planter that rise to the east and west of the simple, earthy pathway, while in the manicured lawns to the north, chocolate sunflowers nod their enormous heads in the moonlight.  White-tufted goat willow creates a decorative screen that hides the travertine walls of the garden, while burnished murkweed grows in loose rings around a dark brown statue."
