      "The sky is set with twinkling stars and the moons shed their soft glow upon the area.  Lounge chairs placed on the unfinished boards of the deck offer comfort for stargazers or for a group of friends to gather.  Grapevines cover the house's exterior around the door and the railing that surrounds the deck.  Over the rail, you can make out the Bay, and the sound of small waves crashing on the sandy beach reaches your ears from below."
