    "description": [
      "The crowns of every tree are arrayed in crowns of autumnal color -- ember reds, fiery oranges, and gilded yellows -- so vibrant that they nearly glow in the tonal light that spills over the crest of the ridge.  Set within the cradle the niche of trees creates is a sizable wooden cabin, with barrel upon barrel of apples lined in an orderly fashion against one side, while the opposite end of the structure is occupied by a tall metal still that occasionally releases puffs of steam from its chimney."
