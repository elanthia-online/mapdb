      "Jungle greenery wages war with itself and with the cobblestone path upon which it threatens to encroach.  Meanwhile, the thick canopy overhead blocks all but the barest of ambient light, making the time of day virtually impossible to tell, and the surrounding jungle is also almost unnaturally silent except for the occasional rustle of leaves and vines.  Exempt from all verdant trespassing, an arrow-shaped sign points to the northeast."
