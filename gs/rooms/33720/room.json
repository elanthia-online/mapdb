      "Centered in the far wall is a tall wooden bookshelf flanked by a pair of large arched windows.  A thick, ivory wool rug covers most of a dark walnut floor under a cherry-inlaid ash writing desk with a matching chair resting behind it.  Tucked into a corner on the far side of the room is a small cast iron stove with an etched top plate, a pair of azure velvet cushioned armchairs arranged around a carved table positioned in front."
