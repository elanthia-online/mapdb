    "description": [
      "The small courtyard is ringed with a stone wall, and is flagged with large slabs of silvery grey.  A metal latticework pergola is thickly covered with winter roses, within whose sweet-smelling, thorny embrace are placed a half-circle of high-backed wooden chairs.  A hearth and stack is built into the surrounding wall, and the blazing bonfire within warms the courtyard.  A pair of glass double doors lead into the cottage."
