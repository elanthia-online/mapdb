    "description": [
      "Past a series of stone statues carved into the forms of shark teeth, a shop is marked by a driftwood sign carved with a pair of shoes.  The evident cobbler does brisk trade, judging from the traffic through and out of its pine double doors.  Through the wide bay windows, the shop appears to cater to sailors, as its wares include a wide variety of mariner's boots.  There are also other styles in abundance."
