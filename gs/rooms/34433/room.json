    "description": [
      "Offering sweeping views across the town's haphazard structures to the sparkling waters of the bay, the rooftop is furnished with comfortable bench seating encircling a central copper-clad firepit.  An enclosure protects the stairs leading back into the building, a well-worn dart board mounted on its outer wall.  Weathered grey tanik box planters, bursting with fragrant flora, surround the space.  Messenger birds swoop in to rest on a perch, observing the area momentarily before taking flight again."
