      "Twin rows of overgrown topiaries frame the roadway before each dwelling, the former knight-shaped bodies left in a disarray of creepers and decaying foliage.  Each topiary grasps at an iron-tipped spear, the tips snapped off cleanly and scattered amongst the debris gathered beneath the sculptures."
