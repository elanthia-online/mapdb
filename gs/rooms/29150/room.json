      "Capped with five docking slips, the pier is framed by support posts wrapped in black rope.  Copper-banded barrels, their lids removed and discarded, sit in a cluster along the eastern border, each housing a variety of gaffing hooks and rope bundles.  Swinging from the rope railing, a small sign proclaims, \"Pier 2 - Slips 20-25.\""
