      "Graduated curtains of verdant heartleaf veil the glass-encased booth from view, the floral-engulfed back wall creating a brilliant contrast to the lacquered ebony counter standing within the center.  A raven-haired exchange clerk stands behind the counter, occasionally turning around to prune the blossoms behind her, her belt laden with a variety of small garden tools alongside a quill and tiny inkpot.  The sounds of commerce and seagulls intermingle from outside the booth, the heavy footfalls echoing across the room."
