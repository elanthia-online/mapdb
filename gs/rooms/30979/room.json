      "Smooth, pale yellow sandstone walls are interrupted by green jade-carved ivy leaves that crawl across the trim of the ceiling until it opens up to the second floor.  Arches chiseled into the sandstone texture the walls at equally spaced intervals with tiled murals inside each of them.  Dual pillars break up the room and open up additional space further into the shop, while at the front of the small boutique is a marbled desk that takes up the front and center of the lobby."
