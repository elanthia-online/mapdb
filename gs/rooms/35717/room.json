    "description": [
      "Massive teal and turquoise stones stand in a solemn circle, their surfaces scratched with crude, faded symbols.  Offerings of bone, feather, copper, and coin are heaped at the center of the ring, which is shaded by the spreading branches of a huge strangler fig tree.  Moss flourishes in the giant's shadow, covering the stony ground in vibrant patches of green that contrast starkly with the grey and brown of the surrounding earth.  The strange music of the crags seems a mournful dirge."
