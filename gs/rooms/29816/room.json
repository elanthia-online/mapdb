      "Little light filters into this tiny alcove, making the only illumination the various green-flamed candles set into several nooks along the uneven walls.  There is not much room for anything besides a flat stone shrine, which stretches across the entire space.  Abandoned offerings of feathers and animal bones litter the floor, creating a narrow pathway of treacherous footing.  The overwhelming scent of moist earth, mixed with a faint aroma of incense, permeates the damp air."
