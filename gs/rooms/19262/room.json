      "Here, the large round chamber that forms the main body of this dark and dreadful chapel opens onto a passageway that leads to the west.  The huge statue that dominates the center of the chamber faces to the south, its face turned away from you.  To the northeast a large stone chair occupies another part of the chamber, and to the east, beyond the terrible statue, an arch leads out of the chamber."
