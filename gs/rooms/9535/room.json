      "Bones flow east to west, hemmed in by the high granite walls.  The stench of death is overpowering and any movement of the sea of bones serves to renew the putrescent odor.  Occasionally, rats can be seen darting over and through the piles of bones, their chittering and squeaking accentuated in the thick, malodorous air."
