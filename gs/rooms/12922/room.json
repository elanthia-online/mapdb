      "The street quickly becomes crammed with shops and houses of several shapes and sizes, many of which have nearly been built one on top of the other.  Yards and pathways are nearly nonexistent in this section of the street, having apparently been sacrificed for displays, wagons, wheelbarrows, and banner-covered stands."
