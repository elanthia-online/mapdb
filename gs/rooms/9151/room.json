      "The rear of the keep is constructed of thick palm fronds and hardened mud.  A graceful tower of seashells has been built on one end and is topped with a huge flag that is fluttering overhead in the breeze.  The flag is embroidered with a skull and crossbones overlaying a field of frosted tarts."
