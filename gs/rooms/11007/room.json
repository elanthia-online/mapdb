      "The river widens here past the town, opening up and emptying into a large bay of water.  Sand lines the mouth of the river, making it a convenient place for people to sit about and relax.  A path between two ancient, gnarled olive trees leads to the southeast.  The land rises to the southwest, creating a bluff overlooking the bay."
