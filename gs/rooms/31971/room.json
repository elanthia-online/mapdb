      "Atop a small desk, several boxes filled with various powders leave a strong, indescribable combinations of scents in the small, cramped office.  On a small silver cart, a set of mithril measuring tools and glass vials for mixing await further blending sessions.  Small flyrsilk pillows line the sides of the office, leaving the lone chair next to the desk the only suitable seating for work."
