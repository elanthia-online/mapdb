      "The trail winds along just outside the conifer forest, a small line of demarcation between the encroaching trees and the grassy moor.  It is as if someone has drawn a ragged, wavy line in the earth and declared, \"Trees on this side, grass on that side.\"  No grasses invade the needle-covered ground beneath the pines, and no saplings attempt to push up through the moor's tight blades of grass.  The moons shine down brightly from overhead, equally lighting both sides of the demarcation line.",

A hawk slowly circles overhead, looking for a meal on either side of the demarcation line."
