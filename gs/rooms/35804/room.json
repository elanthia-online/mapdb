      "Iron-framed windows enclose tall panes of glass, the mosaics casting colorful shadows against the lacquered wooden counters of the expansive kitchen.  Lattice-woven wicker baskets spill over with a bounty of goods, the containers hanging above the counters from thin iron chains that softly clink together as they sway above an elongated linden table.  Set beside an antler-framed door is a small porcelain basin, its base forged from eahnor into the image of rearing stallions flanking an elaborate tower shield."
