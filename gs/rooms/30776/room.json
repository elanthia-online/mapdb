      "An oversized oriel glass window brightly illuminates the room with moonlight, the silvery gold glow bathing the space in a suffused warmth.  The far corners are home to a luxurious sleighbed dressed in obsidian black silk linens and a claw-footed red cedar chest.  Arranged in a separate vignette, a milky white marble wash basin is cradled in a tall ebonwood stand, with some amenities within reach under a mirrored fel cabinet.",
