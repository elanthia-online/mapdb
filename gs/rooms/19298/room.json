      "In contrast to the expansive magnificence of the Great Room, this intimate chamber exudes cozy comfort.  Windows overlook a moonlit garden to the east, and in the room's center, tables and chairs flank a large, stone fireplace with some mounted antlers above the mantel.  A counter extends across the entire length of one wall, laden with bowls and trenchers filled with the harvest of land and sea.",
