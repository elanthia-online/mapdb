      "At the bottom of a steep staircase, wall-mounted lanterns cast shadows onto floor-to-ceiling shelves overflowing with unclaimed luggage, the moldering leather cases spilling their contents onto hard packed dirt underfoot.  The dark corners of the substructure are piled with a menagerie of forgotten possessions, a saddle trimmed with tarnished silver on top of one heap.  A path has been cleared through the jumbled maze, but only wide enough to sidle through."
