      "Polished oak beams frame out the spacious cargo hold, their lengths carved with various symbols and images.  Several large iron racks displaying various pieces of armor line one side of the room while sealed boxes and crates are piled on the other.  The light from a trio of dark bronze lanterns casts a pale glow on the collection of items for sale."
