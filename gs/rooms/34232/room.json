      "Flanked by a pair of alcoves, the left one sealed by hardened resin, a tunnel branches off toward an expansive chamber to the southeast.  Ruddy yellow light seethes from within in pulses, accompanied by a pungent, too-sweet aroma.  The smell mingles in a stomach-churning melange with the fetor of old rot emanating from the southern alcove, where a humanoid figure is twined in thick lengths of shimmering gossamer."
