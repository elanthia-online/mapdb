      "The only light in this small, rough-walled room comes from the torches in the corridor, flickering dimly through the barred window in the door.  Most of the room remains cloaked in shadow, but appears to be completely bare of any decoration except for a barred cabinet mounted on the south wall.  There is a hint of damp in the air, and a slightly moldy smell."
