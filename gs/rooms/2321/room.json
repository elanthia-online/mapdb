      "Temple guards with cowled heads dot the scattered crowd of blue-robed monks meandering up and down a broad path over one of the glacier's lesser slopes.  Houses with walls of heavy stone face the glacier's rise.   Some trail sweet-smelling woodsmoke from their chimneys, while others favor earthy peat for their cookfires.  The two fuel sources linger on the whipping winds in a potent melange.",
      "A small group of blue-robed monks walks through this area, heading north up a path in the glacier.  Thick-walled houses face the glacier, sweet smelling wood smoke pluming from their chimneys.",
      "A temple guard walks, bending his cowled head into the wind, north up a path in the glacier.  Thick-walled houses face the glacier, earthy smoke from peat fires pluming from their chimneys."
