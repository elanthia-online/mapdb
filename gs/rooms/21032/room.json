    "description": [
      "A muddy path snakes its way through the thick growth of brush and trees, providing barely enough walking room.  Any vision beyond ten paces is obscured by a dense wall of haze and fog.  Some vines hang lazily from trees, appearing as snakes in the mist.  To the southeast, a monstrous tree has been violently uprooted by some unknown force.  The resulting devastation of the fallen tree has opened up a narrow but treacherous trail that leads deeper into the misty jungle."
