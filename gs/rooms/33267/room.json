      "The lacquered parquet flooring stops abruptly at the bottom of a carved oak counter.  Behind the counter, the flooring is a seamless sheet of polished white marble.  Along the east wall are numerous vats that have been sculpted from raised flooring and separated by etched dividers.  Each vat contains a different dye, while several large mixing pools are filled with skins in various states of coloring.  Along the north wall a carved stone workbench is covered with pelts and tools, while a large portcullis dominates the west wall."
