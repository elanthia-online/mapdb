      "Sheltered from the rollicking surf by the curve of the land, the small inlet is bisected by a freshwater riverlet that slips out of the surrounding dunes on its voyage toward the ocean.  The soft sands of the shallows are pockmarked with tiny holes where hidden clams rest, the gently lapping waters filling them in with each passage.  A series of stone slab steps provides access to a public plateau garden that grows upon the flat surface of a small outcropping."
