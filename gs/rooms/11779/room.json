      "A massive tree with a trunk as wide as a large wagon has overtaken the middle of this neighborhood, and rather than fight the immovable object, those living here have built their shacks in a wide circle around it.  A low stone wall rings the base of the tree, and adds a bit of decoration to its otherwise overwhelming shape."
