      "The expansive kitchen features a large cherrywood counter topped with cotton candy pink marble at its heart, with numerous cupboards, cabinets, and drawers lining the walls.  A hammered copper stove sits between marble and wood countertops, and amidst the gleaming cleanliness, lingering bits of cobwebs and crimson stains can be seen.  A set of swinging double doors leads out."
