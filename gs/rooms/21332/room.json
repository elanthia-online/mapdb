      "The air of this walled garden is filled with the heady scent of lilacs from hundreds of bushes.  Several lilac bushes near the main Sylvanfair tree twine together underneath a stairway leading up to a lilac door.  A large ironwood tree stands in the center of the garden, with a door in its side."
