      "A pile of shattered stone banks the path to the east.  The tips and jagged ends of shattered stone that point in all directions sport swatches of fur and cloth left by travelers foolish enough to attempt to cross the pile.  The stones shift occasionally, as if the earth deep beneath them were moving, or as if something were moving unseen amidst the stones."
