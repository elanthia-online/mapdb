      "[Great Oak, Platform]"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Some thirty feet above the forest floor, a carefully camouflaged wooden platform has been built around the great oak.  Littered with a thin layer of leaves and dust, the platform has not been used in some time.  Even in the dim moonlight, gazing down over the edge provides an excellent view of the old path and intimate woods, while providing the looker with near invisibility among the thick oak branches.",
