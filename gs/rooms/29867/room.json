      "A sluggish flow of crystal clear water laps languidly at snow-clad banks.  Though the river is ebon in the twilight, the ripples of the aurora reflect in distorted tangles over its waters, the colors dancing across a nearby a log-framed encampment.  The far shore is lost in a blanket of thick mist that prowls low over the river's surface.  Fishing poles lean against the rear wall of a nearby hut with a pine-and-pitch facade, though a nearby spruce drying rack is bare of fish.",
