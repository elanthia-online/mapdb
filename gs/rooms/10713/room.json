      "Looking over the inner wall to the northwest, the top of a dark structure can be seen.  To the west, the walls continue to parallel one another, each wall as straight as an elven-made arrow.  Wooden guy-poles have been placed to reinforce the outer wall.  Moonlight does not do much to improve the look of the area.  A few of the poles have rotted into useless bits of wood, but most remain firmly in place.",
