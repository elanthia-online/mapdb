      "Combatants clash in vividly realized battle across the walls overlooking a dais of grey-shot ebon stone, splashes of crimson and glints of silver punctuating the dark imagery.  At the center of the dais stands an altar supported by statues of grotesquely muscled warriors.  The dark steel slab appears to have been wrought from the remnants of several dozen swords, their sharp-edged shapes melded together but not entirely lost to the forge.  Steps proceed down through a hammered black steel arch."
