      "Hints of otherworldly color suffuse the porous stone of the plaza, mirroring the too-vivid blues, greens, and oranges of the nearby springs.  Several obelisks, no two alike in configuration, stand along the edges of the construction.  No seams exist to mark where they end and the plaza's stone begins, making it appear as if they sprouted where they stand.  They cast wobbling shadows in the capricious light of nearby gem clusters."
