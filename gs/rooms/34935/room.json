      "Onyx-embroidered jacquard curtains frame the shop, the layered fabric draped across the lyshaelyn-inset windows casting various beams of color upon the elongated counters.  Root-crafted bookshelves line the grey-colored stone walls, the tomes and scrolls obscured by the graduated lengths of dried herbs interspersed between the knotted yarns ropes looping across the ceiling.  A duo of heliodor-eyed cats stand at the back of the room, their blackened iron tails coiled around their clawed feet."
