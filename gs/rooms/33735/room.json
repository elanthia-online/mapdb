      "Set back from the main room, the small nook is enclosed by panels of rough driftwood.  Terracotta tiles are set into the floor in a haphazard pattern with a tarnished brass lamp on the wall the only light source.  A runner of woven sea grass creates a cushioned walkway leading to a heavy beaded curtain."
