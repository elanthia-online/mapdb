      "White sands curve gracefully along the grotto's edge, where rough oak steps lead down to clusters of oyster beds and shimmering tidal pools that mirror turquoise waters.  In these shallow pools, tiny marine life flits among patches of seaweed, while a long driftwood table nearby displays assorted wares designed to house pearls."
