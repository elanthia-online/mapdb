      "A large boulder sits directly in the middle of the path here, its surface worn slick by thousands of idle touches as visitors to the graveyard have passed by.  A mournful bird can be heard calling from somewhere in the distance, though it's impossible to tell from which direction the sound is coming.  The tombstones in this area seem slightly older than the ones nearer the gate, and their surfaces bear the telltale marks of weathering."
