      "A small canyon runs down the mountain side.  Hardened lava fills it almost completely, providing a natural road that is welcome after the harsh rock below.  The air is thick with the smell of sulfur and clouds rise fitfully from somewhere above.  This is one bed that nobody is likely to be sleeping in.",
