      "A single stone slab forms the floor of this room, though it bears many telltale signs of heavy wear.  An oversized worktable stands against the far wall, scattered with debris of various sorts, and etched into the floor is a nearly perfect circle with faded runes painted around its edges.  Some wide shelves sit off to one side, the wood visibly pitted and charred but held together by large iron braces."
