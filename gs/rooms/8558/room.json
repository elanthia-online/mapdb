      "Dozens of wildflowers bloom here, creating a rainbow of color across the landscape.  Near a particularly large grouping of bluebells is a small cluster of blue-grey frilly-capped toadstools with cream spots.  Every so often a colorful butterfly flutters over and lands on one of the toadstools for a brief moment before searching out its next flower.",
