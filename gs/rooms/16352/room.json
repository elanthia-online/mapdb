      "An elegant, flower-patterned rug covers most of the floor, reaching almost all the way to the ivory silk-covered walls.  Hanging from the walls are exquisite antique paintings and weapons, and a bookshelf against one wall displays a collection of well-worn books.  Rosewood tables lined up in the center of the room display various weapons, armors, arcane items, and other goods."
