      "Abruptly, the obsidian-inlaid stairs open to a wide-ranging room that has an austere design but is richly outfitted with finely wrought finishings.  Protected on an exceptionally well-lit side, a lustrous smoked glass worktable sits in front of some towering acacia koa bookshelves that are brimming with leather-bound books and study materials.  A gilded staircase leads up to a raised platform, haloed by a sheer, glass-domed cupola that is supported by thin beams of veil iron."
