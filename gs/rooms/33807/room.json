      "A long wooden counter runs the length of the back wall, stained with old liquor and blood.  Corked bottles line cubbies that have been hollowed into the stone wall, and mounted between them is a huge, grizzled goat's head with bulbous lifeless eyes.  Tables and chairs are placed about, some of them more worn down than others.  The aromatic blend of spices and meat wafts through the area."
