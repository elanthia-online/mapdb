    "description": [
      "A dock of uneven planks strains creakily out over the frigid river, greying wood and dark water lit only by the ripples of the aurora above.  Several boats are tied to the dock by arm-thick lengths of twine, and even without their oarsmen, they are sleek in the water and carved in a way that suggests deadly grace.  Mist lies heavy over the water, obscuring most of the far shore and the expanse of white beyond."
