      "Arcing to follow the curve of the Vornavian cliffs, the granite wall becomes shorter as the distance between the two cities expands due to the natural formations.  Short terraces dot the cliff face, each incredibly narrow and overflowing with vibrant apple blossom clematis, the dark leaves and vines of which dangle down to touch the cobblestone lane.  Northward, the storehouses and customs buildings give way to a wide road and smaller buildings surrounded by paddocks."
