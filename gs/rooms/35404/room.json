      "Swathes of crisp linen canopy the booth, their pale fabric shielding the frozen treats from the warmth of the air.  Sturdy wooden counters, painted deep cerulean, hold chilled basins nestled in beds of crushed ice, each brimming with flavors both familiar and unexpected.  Small ceramic bowls, glazed in muted earth tones, rest beside neatly stacked wooden spoons.  A chalkboard sign, its edges decorated with pressed wildflowers, displays the day's offerings in looping script."
