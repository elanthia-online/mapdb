      "The spacious dockyard is filled with the sounds of waves crashing against the icy shores.  The arctic air holds a chilling bite as a frigid wind rakes across the pier.  Flickering torches and lanterns are positioned along driftwood barrels, their dancing light casting deep shadows across a collection of krolvin ships."
