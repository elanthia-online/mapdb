      "Gritty grey stone walls, several sporting clusters of barnacles along the edges, make up the spacious entryway, which is graced with a crookedly hung painting.  A healthy handful of dark-glassed lanterns are scattered around the room, most on the ground, though several make their homes atop water-stained wooden side tables, the only furniture in sight.  Its pristine condition strikingly out of place in the dour surroundings, a wide white marble cart streaked with grey holds a collection of vials and other sundries.",
