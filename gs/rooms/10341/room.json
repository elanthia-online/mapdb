      "An elaborate rose window filled with blue and green stained glass turns the sunlight to underwater tendrils as it pours over the thin silk rugs which cover the floor.  Tasseled red velvet cushions have been placed in front of low pedestals holding oversized leather bound tomes.  The dark walls are plain save for a fan of peacock feathers mounted above the entryway."
