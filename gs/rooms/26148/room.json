    "description": [
      "Several short trees, their trunks reduced to splinters, block the path to the west and shed bark, leaf, and limb upon the nearby ground.  Piles of dirt, grit, and stone are scattered about the area, creating a mess of organic debris.  Small wren of standing water ripple as the wind passes through.",
      "Billowing clouds glide past upon a persistent breeze that brings both a light chill and the scent of desiccated flesh to the air.  Whistling slightly in its passage, the zephyr dances around the defenses spikes recessed into the walls and along the deep cuts of the distant crenellation.   A lone wren insistently taps at a walnut shell it has wedged into the fitted stones of the bulwark."
