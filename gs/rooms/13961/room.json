      "This simple granite platform extends out from the south wall, supported by several granite arches anchored into the wall.  A winding stair spirals down to the floor of the sanctuary sixteen feet below, and a grey marble opening allows exit into a tunnel in the wall.  From this overhead vantage many aspects of the temple, such as the ledge, the fire ring, the fire sea, the ceiling, the anvil, and the battle axe, show aspects not apparent when viewed from the temple's floor."
