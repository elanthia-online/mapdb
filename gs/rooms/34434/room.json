      "Departing through the surrounding tents and wagons, a sinuous gravel-lined track connects a gaily painted bright yellow wagon to the wider world.  Laying forgotten in the nearby grass, a long oak tongue hangs off the front of the wagon, while large round stones are wedged around the high wheels.  Red-eyed colorful gaillardias and blue-hued asters grow in clusters throughout the shaggy lawn, though they stay clear of the shadows of a small alley that disappears between the back of the wagon and nearby tents."
