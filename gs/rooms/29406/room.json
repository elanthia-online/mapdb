      "Tawny canvas, stretched taut over metal ribs, keeps the interior of this covered wagon dry and comfortable.   A weapon rack and an armor stand dominate the cramped space, leaving little room for browsing.  A small wooden seat has been built into the far end of the schooner, providing a rough resting place for patrons."
