      "Hewn into the stone walls without much care for aesthetics, this niche is cramped and close.  Thin candles, their flames burning dull blue, are scattered around the space, lending scant illumination to a rickety shield rack in one corner and some rusted iron hooks set into the wall above it.  The musty smell of damp stone permeates the air."
