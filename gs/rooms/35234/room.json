      "The sand alongside the boardwalk is cool and flecked with bits of washed ashore seaweed and organic material.  Many pieces of colorful, stitched-together linens drape down over the boardwalk's edges and reach nearly to the sand.  These linens billow in the breeze and are backlit by lights from above.  Fronting these vibrant pieces of cloth and lit by stout candles, a long and battered driftwood table has been placed."
