      "Slitted holes in the floor offer a view of the inner portcullis below, in addition to a larger square opening next to which lies the rusting remains of an iron cauldron.  Beyond the parapets' crenellations, the marsh spreads out across the horizon.  In between patches of fog, a small cluster of buildings appear to the southwest and much farther away, a tower with a blue roof marks the location of Maelstrom Bay."
