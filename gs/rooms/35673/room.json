      "The shadowed path sinks into a narrow gorge littered with skeletal fish.  One skeleton's spine has been cruelly harvested, leaving behind only jagged rib bones strewn about.  On the opposite sides of the towering walls of water to either side, living fish dart past, seeming little bothered by the miraculous magics restraining the tide.  Great ripples distort the surfaces of each wall as the sea fights to escape the power holding it in check."
