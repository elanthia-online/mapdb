      "Gnawed bones and shed white hair form a treacherous carpet on the floor of the den.  The cave mouth is at an angle that shields the interior from the wind, and while still chilly, the little enclosure is spared the worst of the elements.  A low ceiling curves to form the rear wall of the cave, onto which primitive figures are drawn in old, flaking pigments.  The distinctive musk of canines suggests that the den is still very much in use."
