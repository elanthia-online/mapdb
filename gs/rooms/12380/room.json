      "The chamber is more garden than house, with polished wood-plank walkways winding through heavily foliaged beds.  Overhead, the ceiling is painted to represent a cerulean blue sky with heavy white clouds drifting across its surface. From the back, the splash of a waterfall adds its gentle song to the chirp of birds just outside windows, which cover most of the walls.  A walkway leads through a collection of wicker chaise-lounges, into a stand of huge palms which serve as a living screen."
