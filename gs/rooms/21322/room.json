      "Looming under a verdigrised copper dome, a brass telescope features a bewildering array of various iron and mithril wheels, cranks, and pulleys designed to rotate the observatory.  Set high on the walls around a copper panel are intricate charts marking the paths of stars and moons in the night sky.  An armillary sphere dominates the rotunda, which is surrounded with several cabinets and racks.",
