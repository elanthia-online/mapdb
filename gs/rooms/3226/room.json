      "Cresting the hill provides an overview of Icemule Trace near this part of the wall.  Several streets are visible, crowded with people going about their daily business.  Smooth, flattened paths streak down the hill to the stone fortification rising up at the bottom, indicating that this is a popular locale for sledding.",
      "Cresting the hill provides an overview of Icemule Trace near this part of the wall.  Several dark streets are visible, dotted with circles of flickering gold from lampposts that line the way.  The trees have pulled back from this small rise just enough to make it an ideal location for stargazing, distant from most ambient light."
