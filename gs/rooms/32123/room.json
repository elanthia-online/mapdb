    "description": [
      "Tilting at a precarious angle, a sunken fishing dock manages to stay intact only because of the thick clumps of moss growing throughout its waterlogged frame.  Ankle deep, the motionless water covering the dock is murky with sediment and detritus while the center of the pond clearly reflects the colorful hanging mosses in the canopy above.  A moss-shrouded wooden gangway leads away from the dock."
