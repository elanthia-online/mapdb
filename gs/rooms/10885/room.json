    "description": [
      "Surrounded by water, this narrow strip of beach offers a clear view of Maelstrom Bay and a larger body of water to the south.  Small shells litter the beach and an occasional crab scuttles quickly to the safety of the water, leaving a tell-tale track in the soft sands which is soon erased by the gentle breezes.  To the east, the mainland seems far away from this quiet and peaceful corner of the island."
