      "Someone went to great lengths to add some color to the ordinarily drab cobblestone road.  A series of colored stones have been placed in a complex knotwork pattern, creating a striking effect.  The stones appear to be much newer than the original, yet the craftsmanship apparent in their laying shows the same high level of skill as the original construction."
