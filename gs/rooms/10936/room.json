      "Small, round tables scattered across a creaky wooden floor comprise this small backroom shop.  Each of the tables has been covered with a cream-colored linen cloth, providing ample space for the shop's wide variety of wares.  A brass lamp hanging from one wall serves as the only decorative piece in this quaint little space, and an iron-worked rich maoral door is inset into the back wall.",
