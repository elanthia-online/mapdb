      "The tall hedges have been pruned back to form a smooth pathway within the maze.  Encroaching ivy has been trimmed away, leaving scattered gaps along the high herbaceous walls.  A finely carved marble fountain has been set in the middle of this path, the bright sun reflecting off the crystal clear water flowing from its peak."
