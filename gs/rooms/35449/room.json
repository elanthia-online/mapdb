      "Charcoal grey wood planks form a shoreline path that connects to a sprawling dock system, the worn wood held up by white travertine pillars that rise from the sand and water below.  Large clay pots brimming with bold succulents and colorful flowers line the way, their vivid hues standing out against the dark wood.  Ocean waves lap at the shore, darkening the wooden planks with their foamy spray."
