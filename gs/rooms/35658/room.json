      "Creeping fingers of vivid emerald lichen fan out over the dock, colluding with seaspray to leave treacherously slick patches on the sun-bleached planks.  Coins from a dozen different nations are wedged between the boards, accompanied by bits of colored glass and a few sparkling beads.  Their likely source is the mossy remains of a crate that has been reduced to splintered wreckage by disuse and abandonment."
