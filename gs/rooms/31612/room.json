      "A fan-screened fireplace of blackened iron stands across from a group of chairs padded in ebony velvet, the furniture adorned with a wren motif repeating across the emerald-papered archway of the parlor.  Gilt-armed lanterns hang above a glazed lasimor writing desk, casting wayward shadows across the ink-stained ledgers spread across its surface, the well smashed into shards of glass.  A tall portrait oversees the room, the painting framed between curtain-veiled windows covered in threads of silvery webbing."
