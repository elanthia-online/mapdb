      "Nestled between rhododendron and hemlock, a swift stream tumbles over a craggy ledge ten feet above the ground in a continuous waterfall, spilling into a rock-lined pool.  A knotted hemp rope dangles from a magnificent hollow-trunk tree hung with myriad glass orbs illuminating a pebbled path winding through creeping vines and overgrown roots.  Beneath a low-hanging limb, a roomy hammock of meshed twine fishing net offers needful repose amid the tuneful waters synchronized with buzzing insects and echoing birdsong."
