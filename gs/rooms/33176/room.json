      "This cozy redwood-paneled room is draped in softly glowing mosses and colorful flowers.  Rainbow crystals strung about spray colorful splashes of illumination that dart and dance about like tiny rainbow pixies.  An assortment of sumptuous armchairs are casually arranged around an intricate battle-scene inlaid table.  A curtain of shimmering ombre velveteen stands across from a redwood door."
