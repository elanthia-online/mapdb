      "Dunes crowd the northern perimeter of a clearing, with cottages perched in their eddies and upon their crests.  Candles in the windows are lit against the perennial dusk rendered by the drifting fog.  Thick scrub grass grows around the bases of the stilted buildings, flourishing like a dense carpet.  A line of trees border the villa to the west.  The smell of the lake is damp and loamy, and rich with the sound of frogs and crickets."
