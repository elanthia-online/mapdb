    "description": [
      "Set just beneath a gentle incline to the north, the cobblestone lane spreads into a crescent-shaped courtyard bordered by modest homes and shops, all topped with terra-cotta roofs and accented by bright white shutters.  Resting at the center, a copper and stained glass fountain sits, filling the air with the soft sounds of trickling water.  Along the north end is a greenhouse surrounded by an herbaceous garden, while the south end supports a copper-roofed locksmith shop."
