      "A glaes candy dish perches at the edge of a large mistwood countertop.  On a small table near the doorway, a potted fern shrivels.  Thick leather-bound ledgers are stacked on the bookshelves behind the clerk.  Some of the book spines are so worn that the letters on them are scarcely legible."
