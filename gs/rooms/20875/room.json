      "The rough walls of the natural cavern are coated in a glowing green moss.  A trickling stream of steamy water fed by underground hot springs flows through the center of the cavern, feeding the odd indigenous mushrooms and plants found in this humid garden.  In an open bower grows a lush carpet of thick blue moss, providing a comfortable resting place for those wishing to relax and enjoy the strangely beautiful flora.",
