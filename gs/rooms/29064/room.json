    "description": [
      "Though the interior of this modest hut is sparse, the surfaces are clean and the mud floor is blanketed with a soft layer of straw.  Four woven mats are raised up on planks with stilted legs, each covered with a relatively clean swatch of fabric.  A few broken pots and an upturned brass bell hold a layer of soil and some fragrant, blooming herbs."
