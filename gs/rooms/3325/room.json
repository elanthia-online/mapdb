      "The unmistakable scent of mule manure reaches your nose.  Sticking partially out of the ice is a stable, and unfortunately, the scent did not freeze with the building.  Pieces of harness and tack hang from the fence, slowly rotting in the moist air, and straw dusts the floor.  You involuntarily wrinkle your nose, trying not to sneeze."
