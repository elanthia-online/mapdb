      "A sheer rock slope climbs above the treeline.  It is formed of a black basalt, and is encased in a transparent layer of ice.  Contrasting with the dark color of the rock, ruddy stains trickle down from the fissures in its surface, a remnant of iron rich water that once flowed from the heart of the mountains.  Far below and to the west, a glittering ice formation can be seen in the distance.",
