      "The air is thicker up here, hazy with incense and smoke.  The movement of worshipers below in the great hall meld with the spiraling mosaic pattern on the floor.  From this vantage you can see the monks performing acts of devotion in the main chamber of the temple, and the occasional visitor approaching the altar to leave a few silvers in donation."
