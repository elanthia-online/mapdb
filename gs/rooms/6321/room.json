      "Flanked by several lush trees, a large and elaborate building stands to the north, its golden dome glinting in the sunlight.  Small benches are placed throughout the thriving courtyard, and small colonies of flowers have sprouted around them.  A narrow pathway of pure white cobblestones leads toward the structure and stretches back to a smaller building to the south.",
