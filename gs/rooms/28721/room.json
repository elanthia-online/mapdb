      "Varnished ebonwood walls rise from a speckled black marble floor.  Just above a scaled model of Hearthstone hangs a portrait of Darkstone Castle, and a vaulted ceiling completes the picture.  A gold-leafed mistwood cabinet and a vine-carved mahogany table stand side by side in the middle of the room."
