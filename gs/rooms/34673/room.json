      "Rows of carved wooden seats are arrayed before the raised stage, though there are cordoned standing areas for those too tardy or too poor to win themselves a chair.  Though a thatched roof covers a portion of the house and stage, the center of the building is open to the sunlit sky.  Shimmering curtains of rich emerald velvet hang to either side of the stage, held open by golden braids.  A painted green door accesses the theater's backstage."
