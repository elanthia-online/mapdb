      "Bare of any adornment except for a decorative feature, a small engraving on the polished, dark stone floor gleams under the otherworldly glow of a column of cobalt blue energy.  As the light rises and disappears into the ceiling, intricate patterns of light and shadow cast across the room create an atmosphere of sinister power.  A shimmering crimson portal madly swirls out and back upon itself, emanating a faint humming sound."
