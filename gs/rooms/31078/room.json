      "Perfectly manicured and vibrant green, a small lawn of dense centipede grass stretches from a driftwood bungalow to a short picket fence fashioned of narrow white slats.  Departing from the shadows at the eastern edge of the bungalow is a pearly white shell-lined pathway ending at an iron gate that forks to connect a red teak and silver birch stable at one end and a pale silver driftwood door at the other.  A small patio of glazed terracotta tiles offers a place to relax, the many bright white lounge chairs scattered upon it forming a loose circle around a tidy firepit."
