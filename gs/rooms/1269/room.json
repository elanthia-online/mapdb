      "[Dead Plateau, Plank Bridge]"
    ],
    "description": [
      "The crevice narrows somewhat at this point, the sides converging to a separation of approximately thirty feet.  Some industrious soul has taken advantage of the conversion and erected a plank bridge to span the crevice.  The trail continues either across the bridge or follows the crevice eastward toward the plateau's edge again.  For those needing to get across, crossing on the bridge beats trying to jump the chasm...or walking farther into the plateau's interior."
