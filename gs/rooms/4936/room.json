      "Cyclopean marble and granite blocks lie scattered about, their surfaces rounded by ages of wind and rain.  Foundations of buildings circle a deep depression which may once have been a fountain or well, the mosaics set into the slabs all the more beautiful for the desolation that surrounds them.  Although they lean from the vertical, a few columns still stand near one of the largest and most ornate mosaics, marking the site as the probable center of town government or worship in the distant past.",
