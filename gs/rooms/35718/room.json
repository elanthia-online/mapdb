      "Along a narrow corridor shaded by high trees, lengths of bone, seaglass, and metal scraps, dangle from lengths of braided twine.  They fill the air with jangled music every time the wailing winds blow, rattling together in an oddly discordant song.  Huts peek down from the branches above, walls of bundled branches sealed with dried mud.  Doors of poorly tanned hide stretch across openings, flapping with each whisper of wind."
