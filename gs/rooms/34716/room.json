      "Shaded by a stand of bloodwood trees that crowd the hillocks to either side of the road, an elaborate temple of jade-hued sandstone shares a wall with a ziggurat of red basalt.  Metal disks inlaid into the wall form a pattern of scales, the ornamentation starting in bronze and transitioning gradually to ruddy copper near the squared arch leading into the ziggurat's yard.  The temple has a sinuous gate crowned by a striking serpent's head, and glittering emeralds wink from deep within its shadowed maw."
