      "Large brass pillars surround this central chamber, reaching up to the high vaulted ceiling.  Intricate mosaics decorate the floor with a complex spiraling pattern.  Numerous monks sit in quiet prayer, entranced by the thick incense floating skyward.  In the center of the room stands a raised dais supporting an intricate altar, and above you glimpse several worshippers peering down over the balcony."
