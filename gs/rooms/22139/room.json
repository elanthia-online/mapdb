      "Framed in silvery mistwood, a beautiful painting of Solhaven covers one wall, the giant piece of art perfectly detailed.  An arched glass door leads out onto a balcony, its frosted panes etched with beautiful peacock feathers.  A pair of potted shrubs are placed to either side, their verdant hues a sharp contrast to the white silk walls of the hallway."
