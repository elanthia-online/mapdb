      "Frigid wind scours the rooftop patio, shivering the branches of a pair of dwarf pines clad in spiraling strands of fine silver chain.  The low wall surrounding the space offers a panoramic view of Fortune Plaza's sprawl below, with its brightly colored tents, stalls, and wagons.  Near the northeastern corner of the patio, a winding basalt staircase descends into the auction house."
