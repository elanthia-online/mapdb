      "Bathed in the light of tall pillar candles burning in rough-edged nooks along the granite walls, an elaborate desk houses the accoutrements of the guild's clerk.  Quill pens from a number of bright-plumed birds sit near several pots holding inks of different colors.  The desk is carefully positioned to watch over a white ash door inlaid with a spill of golden coins, just beyond which stands a tall mosaic archway that marks the hallway's end."
