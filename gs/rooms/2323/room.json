      "War engulfs the end of the street as halflings and giantkin of all ages fling packed snowballs at one another.  Battle lines have been drawn in abutting yards, where several forts of snow have been erected to provide respite for some of the sodden combatants.  One entrepreneurial halfling lingers at the sidelines, selling towels to both sides, but his wares seem to be only marginally dry.",
      "You duck just in time to avoid a flying ball of snow.  A large battle is in progress here, with halflings of all ages flinging wet snowballs in all directions, occasionally managing to hit each other.  Several forts have been erected in nearby yards, where the combatants can briefly escape the war.  One entrepreneurial halfling seems to be selling towels for each side to dry off with, although his wares seem to be only marginally dry."
