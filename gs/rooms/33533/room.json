      "Layers upon layers of lush inytela billow down from the ceiling, the sparkling, twilight blue silk panels creating a pathway that wends through the pavilion.  Each panel depicts a different constellation, and intricate embroidery along the edges highlights various flora of Atan Irith.  Under a trio of toadstool-embroidered banners sits a polished ekata rack and a carved nightwillow counter, while a series of apovta shelves is framed by panels edged with tiny mereviolets."
