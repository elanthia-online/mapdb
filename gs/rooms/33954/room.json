      "Though only a single room, the hut is deceptively large and incredibly tidy.  Smooth stucco covers the walls, which are only interrupted by round windows of decorative stained glass.  Frosted globes dangle from the ceiling, providing ample lighting for viewing the various vials and jars stored on a nearby bookcase.  Colorful floral designs decorate the quilt that covers a brass-knobbed bed along one wall, while a copper brazier in the heart of the space keeps the dampness of the surrounding forest at bay."
