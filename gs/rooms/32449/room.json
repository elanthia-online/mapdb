      "Wrought iron cages, eaten away by rust, are empty of the creatures that once called them home.  All that is left behind are beds of mouldering straw and the crumbling remains of a pottery water dish lying on its side in the shadows.  Even the smell of dog has abandoned the open-air kennel, leaving naught but the whispers of the breeze to occupy the place."
