      "Whitewashed stone walls rise into a steep, shadowed peak, their surface rough despite the fresh coat of paint.  Light filters through tall stained glass windows, scattering fractured bands of coral and blue across the flagstone floor where rows of plain wooden pews stand in solemn order, their edges worn smooth with use.  Flanking the open doors, a series of wrought iron hooks juts from the stone, their stark outlines fading into shadow as the gloom beyond swallows their presence."
