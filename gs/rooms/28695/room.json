      "Large mullioned windows and high, arched ceilings contribute to the open and airy feel of this comfortable salon.  A pair of tufted cream silk chairs on curvaceous legs flank the blue-grey riverstone fireplace, their celadon cushions a cool contrast to the golden hue of the overstuffed settee opposite them.  Bookcases lining the northern wall contain volumes of poetry and books on art, to accompany the easel near the windows, taking advantage of the ample light.",
