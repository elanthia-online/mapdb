      "From the center of this scaled-down rotunda, knotted oak floor planks radiate outward.  In the middle, a miniature whispering willow grows in a soil-filled depression, musically watered from a pipe extending out near the ceiling, nourishing the permanent guest.  A skylight inset with a kaleidoscope of stained glass dragonflies crowns the space directly above the tree.  Hugging half the wall of the rounded room is a semi-circular bench next to a silver-embroidered cerulean curtain."
