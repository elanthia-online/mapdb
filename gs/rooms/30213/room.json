      "Water-darkened oak and fel have been intentionally scuffed to provide purchase on the perpetually slippery catwalk.  Set side by side along it are a polished oak shop and a glass-paneled oak building, both held up with several support posts of saltstained ironwood.  A wide ramp heads away from the catwalk and its large docking structure."
