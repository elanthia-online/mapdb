      "Spilling into the beach, tumbled stones stand at the head of a game trail that disappears through dunes that are covered in feather-headed grass.  Rhythmic and persistent, the azure waves deposit a bright frothy, white surf upon the glittering sand before receding into the turquoise waters of the cove.  A long picnic table surrounded by sun-faded benches sits back from the tideline and is relatively dry."
