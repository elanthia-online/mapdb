      "Much of the swamp vegetation has been cleared away, leaving a narrow pathway running behind the maroon wagon.  Plastered prominently on the side of the wagon is a faded and tattered poster, portraying a number of gemstones and their meanings.  A series of gold-painted pegs dangling an assortment of bags run in a line just below the poster."
