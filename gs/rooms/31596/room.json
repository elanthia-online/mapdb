      "Lush verdant green carpeting creates a muffling effect to the parlor, causing the sounds in the rest of the house to fade away.  Frosted hurricane lanterns are evenly spaced upon the cloth-covered walls and are held aloft by miniature shepherd's hooks anchored to the burgundy chainsil walls.  Armchairs are scattered about the room amid low tables and decorative cases."
