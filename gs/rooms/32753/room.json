      "This double room contains a sitting area complete with an easy chair and a cushioned window seat as well as a spacious bedroom decorated in muted autumnal colors.  A chocolaty brown carpet covers the floor, and rust-colored curtains accent the pale yellow walls.  Four pillows patterned with red, yellow, and brown leaves rest atop the elaborately embroidered comforter draped over the oversized bed.  An elegant crystal vase on each night table holds a small bouquet of chrysanthemums."
