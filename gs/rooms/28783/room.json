    "description": [
      "Sitting beneath a bower of vividly blue ice blossoms, a white pine bench embellished with carved mules holds court before sculptures of halflings and giants gathered over a treaty table of pale carved ice.  The nook is set off from the rest of the sculpture garden, and even the biting cold seems lessened, as the bend of the lodge's walls and the heavy growth of trees just beyond the property's fence conspire to shield the sanctuary from the bitter wind."
