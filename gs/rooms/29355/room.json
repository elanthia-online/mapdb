      "Towers of various boxes stacked floor to ceiling create a winding maze that's been illuminated with glowing toadstools placed at even intervals along the path.  Some maoral coffers and iron chests are stacked to form opposing walls around a crowded toadstool-lit table strewn with leather items of all shades.  Drawers fill an entire wall down one path that stretches into the darkness.  Scents of old wood and musty carpet mingle in the mote-filled air of this cramped, gloomy labyrinth."
