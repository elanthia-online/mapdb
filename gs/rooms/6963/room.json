      "A section of the path edge has recently collapsed here.  Peering over the edge you spot a pile of rubble and the glint of steel, perhaps the remains of a previous adventurer who met an untimely death.  The forest to the north remains impassable, but the path, despite its fragility, seems safe enough to the northeast and southwest."
