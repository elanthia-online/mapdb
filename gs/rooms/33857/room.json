      "Small, rope-bound carts rest against the ebony-carved planks along the boardwalk, the various bottle-filled cases barely concealed beneath sheets of emerald wool.  A branch-latticed pergola of entwined haon and willow provides temporary respite from the elements, the splayed pieces interwoven in verdant heartleaf, the tendrils curling down towards several silk-cushioned benches.  Set beneath the archway is a ledger-filled ebonwood stand, its surface covered in quills and sheets of parchment."
