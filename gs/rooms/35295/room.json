    "description": [
      "Smooth and subtly textured, the ground beneath the cobalt blue canopy is fashioned of planned travertine.  Brightly colored cushions are scattered about the wide area, forming small and large social circles around low cedar tables covered in chilled offerings.  Several smaller, kidney-shaped pools of azure water naturally form to the north and east, each one filled from those higher up the steep incline."
