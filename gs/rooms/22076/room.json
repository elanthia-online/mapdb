      "Multicolored, noxious vapors fill the air above an an alchemical apparatus of twisted tubing and alembics that takes up almost half of the room.  To either hand, the walls are lined with cages holding a variety of animals and large insects--some common, some rare and a few that you've never even heard described before.  Gazing about the chamber, one has to wonder what insane individual would need such a bizarre assortment of equipment and fauna, and for what purpose?"
