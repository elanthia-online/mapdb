      "Deep burgundy curtains drape across a huge bay window, uncovered just enough to allow a stream of moonlight to seep through the glass.  One entire wall is consumed by a huge four-poster oak bed, each wooden post carved with intricate etchings of prowling warcats.  An open archway leads to a wide closet where a brass-edged driftwood chest dwells within.  A tall gilt-hued mirror leans against a wall near a heavy wooden door."
