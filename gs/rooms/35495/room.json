      "Bright sky blue silks drape across the walls of the tent, the cloud-motif lengths slipping through gilded rings radiating from a saffron-colored orb of glass set along the ceiling.  At the center of the shop stands an expansive resaeun-carved clamshell, the pearl-glazed vessel resting upon a bed of ribbon-crafted kelp and pieces of sun-bleached driftwood."
