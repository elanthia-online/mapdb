      "The wind has scoured the rock clean on this side of the mountain.  Not a bush nor a tree nor a blade of grass mars the harsh nakedness of the stone.  The wind whips up small pockets of dust, depositing them in your eyes and ears and clothing.  Through the swirling dust, you glimpse a narrow trail cutting its way up the mountainside."
