    "description": [
      "Exposed to wind, rain, thunder, and lightning, all of which are most severe at the southern end of the north-south pathway, the immediate area is ravaged by unrelenting weather assaults.  Obstructed by a stone embankment, the dead-end overlooks a wide cavity in the plateau, and channels of rainwater stream through the breaks in the stone heap and over the edge.  Once home to statuesque and majestic trees, wrecked and rotten trunks and limbs are scattered about the ground."
