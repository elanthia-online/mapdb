      "Soot streaks down the exterior of a a compact brick smithy attached to an open, wood-framed workspace cluttered with racks of unfinished weaponry, unrefined armor, and countless rafter-hung tools.  Dark smoke billows from the chimney jutting out of the angled roof, fed by a smoldering forge.  On the opposite side of the street, surrounded by tricolor hydrangea, a modestly sized riverstone barracks stands beside a packed dirt training yard."
