      "Tendrils of fog seep out of cracks upon the low ceiling of this rounded corridor, the wisps flowing down toward the floor to shroud the cramped tunnel in a thick haze.  The blurred forms of scattered stones can be seen upon the ground, their rugged surfaces covered with a dense growth of fungus.  Verdant moss hangs down from the fissures above, the fuzzy curtains tinted a sickly grey-green by the outpouring mists."
