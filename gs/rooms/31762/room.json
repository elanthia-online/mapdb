      "Half in shadow and half in twilight, the packed dirt pathway transitions from dense forestry to a rolling grassland of mixed tufts of wood melick and ryegrass.  Towering spruces, one upon either side of the pathway, arc towards the sky, their upper reaches crossing at some point to create a natural archway.  A series of carved warding stones with faces stare into the wood, their amber eyes sporadically flashing."
