      "Beneath lengths of honey-hued gossamer, smooth white sand covers the floor of a timber-framed pavilion.  Some woven reed baskets dyed vivid scarlet are scattered along the perimeter between oversize pots containing local flora and fauna.  In front of a parchment screen, a display table draped with tonal silks offers an assortment of ornaments and trimmings."
