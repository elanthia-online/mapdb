      "The meandering trail makes its way through the dark woods, the hard-packed earth providing a sure path through the night's murkiness.  Abruptly the trail ends in a small clearing.  A fire burns brightly in one corner of the glade, pushing back the night with its light.  In the flickering firelight you can make out where the trail resumes on the northern side of the clearing.",
      "The meandering trail makes its way through the trees, the hard-packed earth giving silent testament to the number of people that have gone this way before.  Abruptly the trail ends in a small clearing in the middle of the woods.  The trail starts again at the northern side of the clearing, its end lost among the trees.  A ring of round stones encircles the smoldering remains of a fire at one end of the clearing."
