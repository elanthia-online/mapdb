      "Rich and warm, the scent of drying tobacco emanates from the surrounding repurposed wood walls.  Moonlight gives the hallway an ethereal cast as it streams through garden-facing windows to the west and south.  Providing a cheery contrast to the grey-streaked walls, nearly turquoise blue slate tiles spread across the floor.  The low murmur of voices spills out of a pair of white shutter doors."
