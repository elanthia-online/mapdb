      "Chairs and benches are arranged around a pair of glowing orbs mounted on either side of the curved grey stone wall that forms this spacious alcove.  Intricate engravings have been carved into the wall, depictions of dwarven history from begining to present.  A section of wall remains blank, awaiting its time for the hammer and chisel."
