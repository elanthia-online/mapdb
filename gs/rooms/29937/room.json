      "A gigantic chunk of black stone in the middle of the path leads up to a mist-choked settlement with raw timber walls.  Its appears to have been the rune-carved keystone of a cracked black granite arch marking the road that climbs into the village.  Dead trees coated in a grim, murky frost lend the entire area an ill cast that is amplified by the sweetness of death on the bitter wind."
