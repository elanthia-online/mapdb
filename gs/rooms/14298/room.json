      "Abruptly and without warning, the boardwalk ends at a red painted wooden wall with a small sign on it.  Over the wall are various mounds of used building materials with a faint trail winding beside and between the piles.  Broken lanterns and rusted tools mock the labor that had been intensive in the revitalization of this banlieue.  Off the boardwalk, wooden staves mark off lots, but squatters have appended the \"for barter\" signs to the walls of their shacks for further protection from the elements."
