      "Shifting fog swirls through the room in visible whorls and eddies illuminated by the dim glow of a hanging lantern.  Though nearly lost in shadow and haze, complex sigils etch the walls and flicker with faint color.  Dusty trunks and crates fill the room with a maze-like disarray, but an ornately carved wooden wardrobe stands open against the far wall and gleams with recent polish, a narrow table draped with white cloth nestled at its side."
