      "Thick cloud cover becomes a navigational hazard at this north end of a rock-hampered path, further obscured by a large plateau that casts its shadow over the barely visible trail.  Sounds of loose stones plumeting down the steep slope mingle with winds and pelting rain in a tympanic symphony.  A thick steel wire overhead stretches into the distance and disappears into the clouds to the south."
