      "This small backroom is more cell-like than not.  Set against the back wall, a small cot sits nearly bare, topped only by a thin cotton sheet.  Standing next to the cot is a low desk, covered with several piles of paper, jeweler's tools, and a diminutive lantern.  A thick curtain leads back out to the main room."
