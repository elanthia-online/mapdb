      "A drawbridge painting hangs on one of the oak wainscotted walls, and a light blue plaster ceiling rises overhead.  A brass dancing turtle statue sits in one corner of a polished oak floor.  There is a badly scarred oak counter on one side of the shop and a tall oak and ivory cabinet on the other."
