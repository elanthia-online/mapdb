      "Notable amidst the array of bright awnings and wide-windowed storefronts, the largest business on the eastern edge of the market is a blue-stained modwir building with only a few narrow windows set high in the wall.  An assortment of ceramic vases, jugs and pots are lined up along the wall under the watchful eye of a rather petulant-looking apprentice."
