      "Shimmering silk in pale, sage green hues drapes down from the sturdy mistwood frame of the spacious tent.  The support posts are carved with a series of fern patterns that bend out from the main core.  Woven mats of fluffy, dark chestnut wool cover the ground, while bronze lanterns covered with a leaf pattern illuminate the area."
