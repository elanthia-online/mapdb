      "Facing each other over the glossy mahogany wall, a polished oak door etched with a porpoise and a polished oak door etched with a nymph are built into the walls of the corridor.  Wrought iron lanterns dangle from the exposed, knotty pine rafters and are responsible for the small pools of light that illuminate the dark, windowless space."
