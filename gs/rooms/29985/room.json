      "The corridor opens into a wide cavern with a sinkhole full of sluggish, frothing blood at its heart.  It is fed by a steady drip of sanguine fluid from the rock ceiling, a jagged snarl of red-smeared stalactites and cragged stone.  Despite the frigid air, the blood hisses and steams, filling the air with a vile tang and strange humidity."
