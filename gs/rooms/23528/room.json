      "Wild geese congregate midstream, honking noisily at anyone or anything that comes near.  Upstream, a tree-covered isle parts the waters, its lush shore creating a haven for fish and small animals.  To the east, a wide game trail leads from the riverbank into the untamed weald.  Rustling brush is accompanied by a quick glimpse of something brown, though it moved far too quickly to identify with surety.  Across the river, the shore bends gently south, with boulders of varying size extending into the water.",
