      "This room is clearly utilitarian in design and usage.  Cluttered wooden tables line the walls, interspersed with bookshelves of various sizes and shapes.  Alchemical tools adorn some of the tables, while others hold flawed gems, or piles of parchment.  A large chandelier is suspended from the ceiling, lit with bright yellow flames that cast a bright light across the entire space.",
      "The cluttered workshop has become a maze of wooden tables, bookshelves, and oversized alchemical tools, the potential shortcuts cut off by stacks of parchment covered in splatters of paint.  A battered wooden chest overflowing with flawed gems has been marked with a large arrow to indicate the correct pathways, the jewels casting fractured rays of light emanating from a barely dangling chandelier.  Small pockets of space interspersed between the stacks of books show evidence of hidden inhabitants."
