      "Tiny brightly hued blossoms dapple the emerald green elfin thyme that creeps into the courtyard from the northeast, the verdant greenery growing sparser the closer the travertine pavers get to each other.  Trellises woven with luscious peony plants dominate the northwestern edge of the courtyard, their colorful blossoms offering a sweet, yet heady fragrance upon the cool air.  Ornate facades provide decorative entries to the shops built into the cliff walls, their inviting marbled entries lit from within.",
