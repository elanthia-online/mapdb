      "[Dirt Mines, A Really Big Bucket]"
    ],
    "description": [
      "A large bucket, half filled with dirt, sways precariously at the end of a set of heavy ropes.  Down below, the shaft stretches away into endless darkness, while moonlight glimmers above. The bucket swings back and forth, striking first one side of the shaft and then the other, sending showers of dust into the shadowy depths.  There's a dark opening in one wall, and with good timing you might climb down the side of the bucket and into the opening.",
