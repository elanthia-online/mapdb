      "Heavily draped curtains of stygian velvet frame a trio of glass windows patterned in geometrical designs, the streaming light casting distorted shadows over the half-crescent of riveted jacquard chaises perched on ebonwood legs.  A velvet-curtained corner of the room houses a tri-tiered wire birdcage, the central frames bent open, leaving the doors grasping at the hinges.  A circular rug woven of wren-patterned pashmina partially covers the floor, the scorched planks roughly gouged with reddish sigils."
