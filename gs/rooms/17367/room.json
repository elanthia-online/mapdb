      "The pungent odors of dye and tanning supplies are strong despite the row of open windows along the front of the workshop.  The floor is covered with a palimpsest of dye-stains, marking the room's purpose as clearly as the thick smell.  A pair of workbenches near the door holds a variety of leatherworking tools."
