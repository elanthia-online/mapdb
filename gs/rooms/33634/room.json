      "Several warped wooden barrels lean against the rear wall of the keep, their sides broken and their rotting contents spilling upon the uneven cobblestones of the courtyard.  Dark watermarks stain the walls around passage that has been cut into the wall of the keep tower.  The skeletal remains of a canine lie in a heap of rotted hides not far from the small entry."
