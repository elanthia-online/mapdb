      "You are on the south side of an underground lake.  The water in the lake is more stagnant here.  You can see a couple of blind cave fish swimming lazily in the shallows of the lake.  The lichen on the walls here gives off a dim blue-grey light which is barely enough to see by.  To the west lies the western shore of the lake, and to the east you notice a small tunnel leading into darkness."
