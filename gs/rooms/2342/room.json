      "The octagonal chamber is completely dominated by two colossal statues of women standing at opposite sides of the room.  Only their indomitable beauty rivals their size.  Frescoed scenes, each one bordered in a color, stretch around the walls.  The tableaux tell a story that begins with the scene framed with purple.  On each side of the hall, an apse leads into shadow, one framed with red marble and the other, with black."
