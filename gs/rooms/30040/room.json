      "One of the huge earthen planters along the outer reaches of the terrace has burst open, unable to contain the frozen earth within it.  Brown, dead remnants of the flora within is scattered across the pocked red ground.  The cold black soil has scattered everywhere, leaving a grit that rattles like old bones whenever the wind screeches past."
