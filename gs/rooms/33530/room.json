      "Supported on four sides by durable oak walls, the booth is covered with a red and white-striped awning that hangs over its long counter.  Beyond the counter, the western walls are lined with shelves and laden with drakar-lined bowls and steaming baskets of food.  Upon the opposite wall is a bookcase that holds rhimar-lined containers and paper-lined urns beneath a protective, bug-resistant mesh.  A small sign rests on the counter."
