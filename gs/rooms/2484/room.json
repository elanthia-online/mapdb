      "The grey granite wall is almost hidden in shadows along this part of the alley.  The mud ruts are deep here, and the packing crate pavement is almost lost in the mud and ice that have accumulated from the road.  Wooden planks serve as bridges across the sludge.  The smell of freshly baked tarts fills the air as halfling merchants loudly argue with cart drivers about various loads of merchandise.",
