      "Ferns and broad-leafed palms fill the spaces between, while flowering bougainvillea climbs toward the lower branches, spilling color across the moonlit ground.  A rugged driftwood fence stretches along the edge of the clearing, its posts uneven and weathered.  A crushed seashell path meanders by a giant teak tree, its massive trunk pierced by an ornate black iron gate wrought with dragonflies set deep within the wood."
