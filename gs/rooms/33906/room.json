    "description": [
      "A wide mural of Nielira Harbor engulfs the back wall of the establishment, the watercolored parchment covered in strokes of ink indicating points of interest.  Heartleaf curtains a glass-encased booth nestled in the far corner of the area, the exchange carefully watched by a trio of guards standing by a ceiling-high cabinet of labeled drawers.  Charcoal-drawn sketches of tall-masted vessels encircle a lacquered haon door, the entry revealing a long corridor filled with the scent of aged vellum."
