      "Flower pots are scattered along the silk walls, their floral blooms bringing their sweet scent and dashes of color throughout the area.  A heavy maoral table with thick round legs takes up a massive part of one wall, while opposite sits a large carved pearwood wine rack.  A blue and gold chain curtain hangs down from the ceiling and leads into the rear of the pavilion."
