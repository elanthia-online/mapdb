      "A snake slithers out of the dark underbrush, down the muddy embankment and disappears into the murky waters of the river.  A fallen hardwood featuring a hollow trunk teems with insects across its cracked grey bark, an infernal buzzing filling the air.  The trees close in on either side as the channel narrows and bends."
