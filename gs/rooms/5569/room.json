      "The winch for raising and lowering the tower's portcullis occupies the center of this room.  Several long iron bars protrude from between the gears of the mechanism, obviously jammed into the heart of it to prevent it from working.  Evenly spaced about the floor are a half dozen kill holes opening into the entry chamber below.  Four down-angled arrow slits allow archers to fire into the area of the courtyard just in front of the portcullis."
