    "description": [
      "Enormous cobbles are fitted into the hard, cold ground to create a circular courtyard that houses a large stone-worked tower.  No windows adorn the face of the structure, which is broken by heavy modwir door, though the peak displays archer slits beneath the shelter of a thatch roof.  Dark shrubs, devoid of leaves, ring the cobbles in a well-manicured and tight-knit circle that is only broken near the southern end where a trail leads away from the tower."
