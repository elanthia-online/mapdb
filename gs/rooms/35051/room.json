      "Crude and uneven, the gate leading into the marketplace is an old monument.  Broken chains hang from the parapets to either side, rusting and corroding in the harsh elements.  Beyond the gates the marketplace is host to a jumble of tents, carts, wagons, and stalls in a motley of makes and origins.  A bas-relief on one nearby wall of the compound is obscured by a triumphant mural in strident blues and vivid golds."
