      "Stretching over the water from the fall's west bank, a massive stone bridge seamlessly connects to a narrow strip of craggy rocks that broadens into a wider patch of land further down the lake shore.  Almost entirely unnoticeable, a series of crude steps carved into the mountain's face has been cleverly hidden behind a rough outcropping of stone near where the water spills over the edge and plummets below."
