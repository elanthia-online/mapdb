      "Delicate curtains frame the large windows, allowing only small rays of light into the store.  Vibrantly colored hand-sewn quilts adorn the white walls giving the room warmth while the plush blue carpet keeps the sound of clattering footsteps down to a minimum.  A wooden toy chest is pushed under an ivory table which has a wicker basket perched on it.  A velvet-lined box is carelessly propped against the open door."
