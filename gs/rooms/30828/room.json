      "Jagged dark rocks and compacted sand create a reasonably sturdy path, lined with tall, cylindrical pillars of even darker stone.  The sea collides against both sides of the path, dissipating impotently against the implacable basalt protection.  Far in the distance, a circular stone platform is visible, the atoll looming behind it.",
      "Jagged black rocks form a makeshift bridge leading back toward the beach, and tall cylindrical pillars of even darker stone line the path.  The waves on either side of the path collide with the rocky surface."
