      "Sparse furnishings adorn the rough timber walls of the small restaurant.  A long counter crafted from a pair of oars occupies the majority of the back wall, where a giant copper octopus sculpture stands vigil.  Sunlight filters hazily in from the dusty porthole built near the swinging doors.  A few tables and chairs are scattered about.",
