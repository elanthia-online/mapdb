      "A strange, crystalline dome rises up out of the snow like a giant bubble, its surface a frosted white that sparkles in the light.  All round it, snow is piled in drifts that vary in depth, some reaching halfway up the side which is a respectable distance.  The storm sends sheets of flurries dancing around the structure, like frenzied participants in a wild ritual."
