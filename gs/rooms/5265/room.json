      "A slight breeze breaks the stifling silence here, causing the firs and pines to sway gently.  Crashing waves can be heard to the west as the path approaches the beach.  To the east, the woods grow thicker and moonlight wanes as the trees begin to block out the moon.  The shattered remains of broken seashells litter the path.",
