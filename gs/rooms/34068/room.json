      "The shadow of the town's wall looms over the end of the way, casting the dreary collection of homes and storefronts into darkness.  Street lamps etched with reliefs of strange figures burn brightly, colluding with the sunlight to cast back the shadow, but they are hampered in their efforts by the cold fog that chokes the cobbled road.  Most of the houses along the way are large and old, heavy curtains drawn to preserve the privacy of their owners."
