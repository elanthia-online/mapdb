      "Escorted by lamp posts whose bases are adorned with linked rings, the road delves between two rises in the glacier.  Carved ice steps wind up toward the temple, which crowns the southeastern rise, while a simple trail mounts the opposing slope.  From up the trail comes a vigorous splashing sound.  Shopkeepers do business from burrows that delve down into the ice, and several families have even cut dwellings out of the glacier.",
      "You are situated between two hills in the glacier.  On the southeast hill is the Temple, accessible by a set of carved ice steps, while a simple trail leads up the side of the other hill.  A couple of ambitious shopkeepers do business from shops within the ice, and several families have made homes in the glacier.  From up the trail, a vigorous splashing can be heard."
