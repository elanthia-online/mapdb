      "Modwir walls enclose the well-sized shop, their surfaces colored with a whorled pattern of deep and light blues.  Small child-sized handprints of white paint are scattered along the walls, each one containing a scribbled name, and shaped to resemble a falling snowflake.  A large window opens near the entrance, where a burly giantman greets visitors.  A crowd of onlookers stand on the outside of a half-walled arena, watching as several people skate along a stretch of ice."
