      "A quiet path veers south of the bazaar along a residential street fronted by homes of all shapes and sizes.  Rowhouses stand by small manses owned by some of the town's wealthiest denizens.  The sounds of the town are muffled by the thatched roofs of several houses, aided in the effort by evergreens growing along the road.  A fountain burbles in the courtyard of a tall brick building near the far end of the road.",
