      "Tall beams of grass green wood create an open-air framework for a number of straw-filled pens, the spacious stalls echoing with various bleats from their occupants.  The iron-riveted posts are hung with buckets of feed, brush-filled pouches, and other provisions for the woolly animals, the string-tied gourds swaying across the fence with the ambient breeze.  A series of tree stumps are set within the enclosures, the various heights providing a number of perches for the playful creatures."
