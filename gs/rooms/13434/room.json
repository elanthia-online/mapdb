      "A petite sylvan woman moves nimbly about between a white marble-topped counter and the west wall of the shop.  Behind the counter, every inch of wall space is covered with narrow shelving that holds scores of small, brightly colored bottles.  The shelves even line the broad windows that flank the shop's entrance, displaying dozens of the crystal containers to passersby."
