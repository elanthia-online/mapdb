      "The vaulted stone ceiling is decorated with hanging iron chandeliers that cast a soft glow across the room.  A massive dining table covered with a dark cloth dominates the heart of the room with seemingly countless chairs surrounding it.  Uniformed workers come and go from a winding metal staircase that leads down to the kitchen."
