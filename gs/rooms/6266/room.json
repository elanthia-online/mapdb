      "The owner of this little home was either too poor or too lazy to build a roof.  Fortunately, the north wall is a scavenged piece of drawbridge that lists inward enough to huddle under during a storm.  For a door, someone has nailed up a smelly shirt that reminds you of its presence periodically as it flaps in the breeze."
