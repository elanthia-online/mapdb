      "Statuesque deciduous trees of several varieties are scattered to either side of the wide dirt path, while lush green grass carpets the ground in between the leafy giants, creating an inviting park-like setting.  The silvery glow of moonlight filters through branches overhead, illuminating a small granite boulder with a green marble plaque set into it.",
