      "Tightly spaced corn stalks sweep southwest and southeast like dark green soldiers standing at attention.  Their long, ribbed leaves wave slowly in the warm breeze, flapping against each other to produce a quick fluttering sound whenever a sudden gust of wind blows through.  The soil is dark and crumbly, and the corn stalks appear healthy despite the presence of thousands of weeds that enjoy the two feet of unplanted soil between the rows."
