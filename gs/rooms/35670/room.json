    "description": [
      "A sliver of rocky ground rises out of the restless sea, barely large enough to stand upon and nearly lost among the surrounding hulks.  Jagged stones are scattered across the surface, worn smooth in places by the ceaseless crashing of waves.  Sparse tufts of coarse grass cling stubbornly to crevices, but nothing else grows.  Waves surge against the land, occasionally drowning it entirely beneath their briny currents."
