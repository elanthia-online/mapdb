      "Black invar sconces are lit behind crimson-colored draped canvas near the top of the walls, giving the showroom a dim, red glow.  Displayed on the west wall are several hangers of goods and a trunk opened wide for curious customers.  On the north wall hangs a rack made of hammered steel, more than sturdy enough for its contents.  Almost hidden behind the drapes on the east wall is a curtain made of the same canvas, adorned with images of black hammers and anvils."
