      "A slight sloping hill leading up towards the elevated center of the island is lightly wooded with young trees.  Thick ferns and moss cover the loamy ground.

Flashes of white corpse plants are revealed as the foliage is disturbed by a breeze, their curling heads seemingly shunning the sunlight."
