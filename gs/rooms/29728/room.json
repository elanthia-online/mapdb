      "Sunlight slips through haphazardly arranged canvas awnings that stretch across a corridor built between the various paddocks of the copper and oak corral.  Black sedge dapples the ground and sprouts up between the supports, the tufts left natural to allow the animals stored here something to munch on.  Dormant lanterns mark the entrance to a western paddock, where someone has tied colorful ribbons that flutter in the wind.",
