      "Wide glass panels lead to an open-air workspace, where racks of tools and piles of materials are stowed neatly under the terracotta portico.  Pottery wheels and a brown brick kiln on a squat firebox are positioned on the northern side of the yard, and tidy trundle-style workstations for sculpting and other large craft take up the central area.  Arborvitae peek above the alabaster privacy walls, where low terracing in ruddy slate features a quaint garden, set with faded leather curule chairs along the southern side."
