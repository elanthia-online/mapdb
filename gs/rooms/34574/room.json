      "The leaves of the trees and vines appear to twist and curl, their shapes distorted and misshapened as if some dark force possessed them.  Overgrown tropical vines adorned with florets cover the path while the shadows cast from a thorny tangled thicket seem to writhe on the ground, twisting and turning in the moonlight.  The leaves appear laced with a hint of malevolence."
