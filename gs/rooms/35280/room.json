      "Damp charcoal grey planks span the pier, held aloft by pristine white travertine pillars.  Cobalt blue and emerald green blown glass orbs dangle from the overhead ropes, catching the moonlight and casting colorful reflections onto the aquamarine waters below.  Waiting cargo crates are stacked neatly near the end of the pier."
