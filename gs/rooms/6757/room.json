    "description": [
      "A broken, stony meadow slopes down before you towards a brush-lined creek.  Short, limby pines and modwirs line the ridgetop, and a shaded path wends its way towards a forested valley to the west.  A gentle breeze blows across the meadow, carrying the distinct smell of the roltons and gaks that call this pasture home."
