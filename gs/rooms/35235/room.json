      "A faint, foul odor cuts through the night air.  Discarded bait and decaying fish-parts strewn from the boardwalk above litter the sand, staining it a coppery brown-red.  Above these myriad stains and flanking the boardwalk's pillars is a candle-lit driftwood table.  The rhythmic sound of waves pushing ashore into the dunes that flank the area offers a constant counterpoint to the periodic trills of wildlife."
