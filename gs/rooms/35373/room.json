      "Steps continue along the lower spine of the dragon carved into the slopping terrain, but here, one of the surrounding travertine pools has overflowed, cascading onto the stairs.  Charcoal grey planks span the flooded sections, creating a bridge over the shimmering, mineral-rich waters.  Moisture clings to the planks, glistening in the starlight.  Striations of white, beige, and rust in the surrounding stone highlight natural patterns formed by mineral deposits over millennia."
