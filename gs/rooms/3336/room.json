      "The pavement in the road breaks up over an earthen lump struggling through the stones.  Some of the cobblestones are smashed in two, thrown back away from the rise as if something had tried to break its way through to the surface.  Other buildings lean crazily away from the middle of the road, their internal structures groaning when the wind picks up."
