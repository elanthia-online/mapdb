      "Dark stones and white sands spread scross smaller rocks to create a path leading northerly toward the atoll, with the center point of the sandbar immediately to the southeast.  Barely discernible in the distance, the beach's bordering greenery is outlined against the sky.  The front of a small rowboat's skeleton rests at the edge of the water, its occupants long gone.",
