      "Threading between arching trunks, the game trail winds through the forest before vanishing into thick undergrowth as little more than a shadow.  At the center of a ring of bowed trees stands a round bark-sided hut sporting a thatched roof.  To one side, a small garden of medicinal and culinary herbs grows in loose rows that meander into the woods, their tended edge giving way to wild sprigs."
