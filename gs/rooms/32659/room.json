      "All sorts of strange articles lay piled up on the floor and against the walls of this room.  Twisted metal shafts and warped plates lie together with misshapen rubbery green balls and light brown bands.  Much of the mixture is coated with thick black grease, and it all seems to adhere together to defy removal.  Whether it is trash or treasure is anyone's guess, but the haphazard way it is strewn in the room suggests the former.  Interestingly, many unidentifiable bones are also part of the piles."
