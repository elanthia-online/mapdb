      "Splintered boards and shards of broken glass smatter the off-white cobblestones, somewhat blurred by the veil of dark mist undulating slowly across the ground.  A few thin trails of colorful flower-dotted vines hang down from ledges of high-set windows, adding a much-needed touch of color to the bleak and dreary atmosphere."
