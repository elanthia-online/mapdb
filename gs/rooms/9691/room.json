      "A large cavern nestles underneath the sheltering mountain, blocking the wind and keeping the driven snow at bay.  The floor of the cavern is fairly level and dry, although it is definitely no warmer in here than outside.  A wide chasm separates this snug harbor from the glacier directly to the south.  Every so often, across the chasm, a predator moves up, sniffing the air and glaring across at you.  Then it turns and grudgingly retreats."
