      "Larger by far than the surrounding structures, the village's great hall has a yawning entrance flanked by toppled statues that are defaced to the point of unrecognizability.  The rankness of decaying meat wafts like fetid breath from the mouth of the longhouse, cloying in its rancid sweetness.  Even the shreds of mist whispering over the ground seem to avoid the place."
