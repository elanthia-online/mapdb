      "A massive banyan tree reigns supreme here, its enormous aboveground root system creating several nooks and crannies large enough for most to stand upright within them.  Springy moss carpets the ground, and lush ferns and flowering vines wind between the smaller trees that ring the copse beneath the banyan's expansive canopy."
