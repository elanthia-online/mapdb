      "Extending in all directions from a shallow channel are hundreds of considerably smaller arteries that wend and twist around one another, vying for dominance in a race to the heart of the neighborhood.  To the north, a row of charred stakes rises over smoldering piles of half-burned ropes and blistering wood.  Footprints of varying sizes lead away from the martyrdom stage, though it's difficult to tell if they belong to the rejecter or rejected."
