      "Steam rises from a large oblong pool as the water glistens in the sun.  Crystal oil lamps atop tall silvery poles rise from the polished river stones which cover the ground to the tall evergreen trees that enclose the area.  Small tables rest between pairs of dark wicker lounge chairs with deep green cushions.  A small channel leading off the pool flows to the door of a petite boat house, and a series of glass doors lead into the inn.",
