      "Statues with little commonality of form stand at the four corners of the antechamber, carved from porous black stone that glints wetly in the light of torches hung from the walls.  Caught in twisted sconces of blackened steel, the torches' flickering flames awaken strange glints of otherworldly color in the cyclopean blocks of blue-black glaes composing the alien architecture.  Shadows flirt with the hideous statues, making their hodgepodge of tentacles, wings, and claws seem to twitch with agitation."
