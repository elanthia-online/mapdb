      "Filtered light slants through cracks in the sea cave ceiling, dancing across smooth stone walls painted with swirling inks, while bioluminescent coral lining the floor casts a soft glow.  Behind a driftwood counter curved along one side are shelves lined with vials, brushes, and patterned stencils.  The faint trace of crushed kelp and salt drifts through the water, accompanied by the steady, rhythmic pulse of distant tides.  Set into the far wall is a glass-spined coralline fissure, its edges rough with clustered growths and glinting ridges."
