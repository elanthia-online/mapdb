      "Coral ridges form an intimate chamber, walls alive with creeping polyps.  Smooth stone benches cluster in a semicircle beneath dangling mosaics of sea glass threaded on kelp.  A woven seagrass curtain drapes across an opening in the wall, fibers undulating in gentle currents.  The reef's natural contours shape the seabed, alternating between firm limestone and soft coral beds."
