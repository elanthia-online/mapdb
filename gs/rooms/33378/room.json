      "Culminating in a peak, floor-to-ceiling stained glass windows dominate the western walls, allowing sunlight to filter through and paint the cold cobblestones in splashes of bright colors.  Stretching across the fel and ironwood flooring is a long emerald green runner edged in golden knotwork.  Heavy tapestries fill the spaces between the various entries that decorate the eastern walls, their brass fixtures polished and gleaming."
