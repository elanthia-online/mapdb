      "Long tapestries of tartan fabric drape from hooks that are woven into the joints of the pavilion, where the umber ceiling meets the canvas walls.  Overlapping rugs of bright and dark hues are scattered about the space and provide a touch of insulation from the cold, hard ground.  River reed baskets are neatly tucked beneath long oak tables that display a wide variety of clothes for sale."
