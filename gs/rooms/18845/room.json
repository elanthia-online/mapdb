      "High in the branches of the oak, the thick growth of limbs, intersecting and crossing, offers an easy passageway between the trees.  The boughs are wide and easily traversed, and the moonlight is brighter here.  Far below, the dark maw of a chasm bordered by the narrow ledge of an overlook is occasionally visible through breaks in the dense foliage.",
