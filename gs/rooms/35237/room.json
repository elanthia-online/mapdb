      "Moving away from the boardwalk is a series of dark and crisscrossing sand-blown trails snaking between slick boulders and large pieces of weathered driftwood.  Amid this collection of debris, a gnarled and weather-stripped tree with twisting branches towers over the multitude of thin trails.  Before the gnarled tree, on a dark patch of cleared dirt, rests both a wide wooden bench and a metal lantern atop a driftwood pillar.  In the distance, the calls of birds and other wildlife mingle with the sound of waves."
