      "Spiderwebs glint silver in the daylight that creeps through the branches of crooked birches enclosing the temple's yard.  The silken webs stretch between the trees and entangle a gate of ebon metal along the plot's perimeter, though the noise of the abounding street is muffled and distant.  Dark flagstones offer a path through the creeping undergrowth toward a dark stone vault nestled deep within the thickly clustered trees."
