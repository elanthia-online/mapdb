      "Overgrown huckleberry bushes create a wild border around a small orchard of dead fruit trees.  Climbing strawberry vines cling to an arched opening and threaten to choke the space with their reaching tendrils.  Rotted berries, oranges, apples, and pears linger on the ground where they have fallen due to being left too long on the limb.  The scent of their soft bodies rotting upon the ground fills the air with oddly sweet, bitter perfume."
