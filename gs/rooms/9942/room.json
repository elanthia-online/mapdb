      "Several large grasshoppers leap from the field near the path, extending their buzzing wings to fly for a few seconds before disappearing into a new grassy hideout away from the disturbance.  The wind whistles down from the high moors to the east, bringing a faint scent of something desolate and unwholesome along with the cooling air.",
