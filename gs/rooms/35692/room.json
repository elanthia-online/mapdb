      "Toward the center of the disc, a reef of dead coral sprawls across the path, once-vibrant colors blanched to a lifeless bone white.  The coral forms a jagged, impassable barrier, its sharp arms jabbing upward like skeletal fingers.  Some of the larger branches are cracked to reveal their hollow interiors.  Amid the dead reef are pools of mineral-rich water that shimmer in wild hues, their still surfaces reflecting the skies above."
