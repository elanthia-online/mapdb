      "The dark jungle backdrop of a large lagoon is visible to the north and east, a moonlit beach before it.  Silver glints off a large waterfall that is surrounded by the dark vegetation.  The sound of waves crashing on the beach are audible in the distance, the only sound to break the tranquility."
