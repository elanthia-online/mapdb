      "Several banners hang from the walls, which are also strung with festive garland dotted with flickering crystalline globes.  A matching weapon case and rack stand on either side of a small solstice tree, and a long cedar table displays its wares in orderly rows next to a sturdy sailcloth curtain.  Underneath, resting on the polished teak and cedar floor, is a large ebonwood trunk."
