      "A covered walkway paved with dark blue slate circles a skylit atrium in the center of the building.  A low greystone wall bolstered by a row of graceful black marble pillars ensures that inattentive guests will not step out into the empty space.  A large pane of stained glass framed in dark oak hangs between the pillars across from a heavy, black ash door on the opposite wall."
