      "The level plain of the flats is broken by a series of terraces.  Their edges are uneven, displaying the brightly-hued bands of multiple layers of sediment that have created this terrain.  In the bright sunlight, shadows cast by overhanging rock are stark and the light-colored hue of the unsheltered stone almost sparkles in the glare.  To the west, the terrain slopes down toward a large geyser pool."
