      "The billowing white sail overhead has been patched and repaired so many times it resembles a quilt more than a singular piece of cotton canvas.  A narrow maoral railing fixed with intermittent steel handholds runs the length of the well-oiled deck, which is largely free from clutter aside from a pair of tarnished cannons, a pile of heavy cannonballs, and several rough maoral crates stacked near the bow."
