      "Clouds of dust and dried rodent feces billow up with even the lightest passing footstep.  Nails protrude downward from the low, slanted roofline overhead, posing significant threat to the taller races.  From a low-hanging rafter, a lynched jester hand-puppet dangles limply at the end of a string."
