      "Shafts of moonlight break apart the shadows encasing the depths of a swirling whirlpool next to the rocks, where dark shadows bob up and down as they get caught in the swirling current.  Empty crab shells, the black eyes glistening in the dim light, move amongst the other debris, while seaweed caught in the rocks performs a chaotic dance on the surface of the water."
