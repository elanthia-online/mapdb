      "The advancing crowd thins out suddenly past the towering gates, providing ample room for an ornate half-moon courtyard plated in celestial blue tilework.  Tiered levels of curiously inventive ice-glazed sculptures are tiered along the edges of the wide-open space, abruptly ending at a lattice-gated veil iron portcullis.  Nestled between two tightly spaced wagons, a spirited patch of dark green leaflets has sprouted up through the heavy quilt of snow."
