    "description": [
      "A layer of water only a foot deep covers the floor of what once was an aqueduct for the city above.  A tunnel runs off in six directions from this point to carry the water to the thirsty residents.  A hole leads upward, and a small amount of light filters down from the hole.  The main illumination, however, is provided by a light green glow from the water underneath.  The air is still and cool, and sounds echo easily off the cramped walls."
