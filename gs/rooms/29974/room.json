      "The porous stone to either side of the pathway has fallen away, leaving but a narrow ribbon of stone to bridge a fathomless abyss.  Along the distant walls are stationed the toppling remnants of a veritable army of stone statues, their eroded eyes watching and vigilant.  Above them, barely visible in the dimness, grim pigments depict scenes of battle and bloodshed."
