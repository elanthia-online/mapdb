      "A hollow rasping sound emanates from some shadowed corner of the woods, its source well-hidden in the darkness.  The underbrush has grown profusely, leaving only a few scattered cobblestones to mark the path amidst a tangle of fan-like ferns and creeping briars.  A trampled area in the foliage seems to mark the beginning of a small animal run.",
