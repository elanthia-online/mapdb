      "The elevation here offers a spectacular view of the hills below cast in a pale glow of available moonlight, with beautiful well-groomed trees towering over the vista.  Recessed paths lit by small lanterns lead to elaborate estates carved into the mountainside, some nearly obscured by bushes.",
