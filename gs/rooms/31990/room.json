      "Crumbling marble arches encircle the quartet of pathways, the carved columns consumed by ichor-stained vines climbing along the lengths of stylized fauna, stretching out before several ruined structures.  Dented braziers of rusted brass flank each arch, peeled apart as though made from fragile parchment."
