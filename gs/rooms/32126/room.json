      "Floating detritus collects along the bank as the water ebbs towards a dilapidated rickety fishing dock.  Dimly glowing viridian moss and umber-hued clumps of algae cling to the endmost pillars of the dock, now bare of plank and nail.  Visibility to the northwest is blocked by a thick curtain of hanging mist.  A mist-shrouded ramshackle gangway leads away from the dock."
