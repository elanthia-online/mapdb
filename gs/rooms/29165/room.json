      "Towering above, a wide cliff face of exposed grey basalt columns stretches upwards to the blue sky, the top of which is barely visible.  While completely vertical, ample hand and footholds can be found for even the most novice of climbers.  Hexagonal blocks of basalt lay on the ground at the base, having fallen from the face over time."
