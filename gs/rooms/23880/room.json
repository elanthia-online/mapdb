      "Two ramps meet up with a small platform here, perched in the branches of a beech tree.  Moonlight filters through the leaves, creating a dappled pattern on the rough wood flooring.  Some of the branches rising into the heights seem sturdy enough to climb, and several worn spots on the bark give evidence to that very use.  Globes of rose-colored glass dangle from a few of them, illuminating the dimly lit area with a rosy glow",
