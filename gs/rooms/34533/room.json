      "Luxurious velvet pillows, the color of a rich merlot, offer cozy places to rest in the gilded sconce-lit space.  Intricate parquetry panels the walls, broken up by sumptuous curtains framing the frosted glass windows.  A bevel-edged mahogany sideboard stands adjacent to a hand-inked globe supported by a solid gold meridian."
