      "Wreathed by intricate cloth wall coverings, the small office has whitewashed walls and a thick rug of azure that stretches to completely cover the floor.  Positioned with a clear view of the entry, a decorative mahogany desk is covered with a variety of small embroidery hoops, a basket of various threads, and a cushion filled with darning needles.  Flitting between the desk and the wall coverings, a willowy sylvan clerk tends to the office."
