      "Hardy grasses sprout along the edges of the icy ebon cliffs, protruding roots shivering in the cold wind.  The roar of the surf echoes up the flat cliff faces to either side of the narrow promontory, amplified into a thunderous rumble that ebbs and flows with the crashing tide.  A ribbon of well-trodden path strikes through the whipping tundra grasses."
