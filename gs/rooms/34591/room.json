      "Hanging from a metal tripod is an enormous cast iron cauldron.  Wood is stacked in a brazier beneath, ready to be lit.  A small table covered with various alchemy supplies stands to one side of a small wooden bench pushed against the wall.  Several cut glass globes hover above, giving off a warm glow."
