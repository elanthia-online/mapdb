      "Having made it past the barrier guarding this room, you are treated to the sight of an ancient altar that dominates most of the available space here.  The magic of the barrier appears to have kept this room completely dry, as is evidenced by the musty, ancient smell of the air that has been trapped here for centuries.  You feel a bit unsettled here, as if someone is lurking in the shadows ready to strike at your back at any moment."
