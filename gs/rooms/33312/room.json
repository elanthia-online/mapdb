      "Dingy and cramped, this building appears unkempt but serviceable.  A long wooden bar runs along one scuffed wall, while a set of stained wooden shelves have been nailed above it.  A swinging door leads to a backroom storage space.  The musty smell in the air battles with the sharp smells of alcohol and malted grain."
