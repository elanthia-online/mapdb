      "Ancient petrified oak bookshelves proceed into the distance in every direction, neatly stacked with countless books.  The acrid scent of preservatives mingles with the dusty tang of old parchment in the dry, cool air.  Gold-trimmed charcoal grey carpeting runs down a wide central aisle toward a raised desk topped by a curve of marble.  Atop it are stacks of recently returned tomes and a huge ledger holding enough yellowed pages to be an epic in its own right."
