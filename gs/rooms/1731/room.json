    "description": [
      "A tranquil sea of snow spreads out to the west, north and east to fill Gossamer Valley.  The protruding peaks of the DragonSpine Mountains hem in the valley on all sides, extremely close to the south and closer to the east and north than to the west.  The wind blows steadily, and the air is clear and crisp.  In places the snow layer seems rather thin, however, and, with a few kicks from a boot, quickly gives way to ice or permafrost underneath."
