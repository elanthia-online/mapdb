      "An expansive braided rug of eggplant silk stretches across the oak floor to protect it from the feet of the various display racks and tables filling the area.  A shoe rack is carefully cradled beneath a linen-draped display table where several accessories are available to purchase.  Nearby, a curved brass display rack proudly displays several dresses.  A jeweled door leads back out to the market."
