      "Heavy ribbons of velvet and silk in autumnal hues are artfully woven through the lower tree limbs here, hung in wide, sweeping swags, while metal-framed glass lanterns dangle from the branches above.  The light cast across the area is golden, both because of the brilliant flames glowing within the lanterns and as a result of how the light they shed shines through the surrounding foliage like sunlight through a stained glass window."
