      "The hallway opens into a circular chamber, its stone walls lined with meticulously arranged racks of armor that gleam under the ambient glow of ceiling-mounted crystals.  Each suit stands tall and imposing, the air thick with the smell of fresh dyes and polish.  The floor beneath is etched with runic patterns that spiral out from the center of the room."
