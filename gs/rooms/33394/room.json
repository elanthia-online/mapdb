      "A colossal dome of faenor-framed glass encompasses the botanical garden, the hexagonal panels streaming moonlight across the quartet of approaches scattered across the cobblestones.  Tall groves of trees provide respite across the expansive lawn, shading groupings of chairs placed by the fountain, the crystalline water misting the nearby stall nestled between the fenced gardens.  A vine-arched corner of the square conceals a trio of potted topiaries, the plants encircled by pale benches."
