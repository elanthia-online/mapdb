      "The long chamber of the library is filled from front to end with tall wooden bookcases, their shelves brimming with tomes and manuscripts.  Cresset-cast sconces line the walls, each casting a gentle illumination over the the decor.  Some small alcoves play host to writing desks, while at the end of the chamber a stone column stands lionized.  A wrought iron chandelier hangs above several long wooden tables that sit dutifully in a central clearing of the chamber, complete with simple plush wooden chairs."
