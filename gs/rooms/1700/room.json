      "The wind blowing over the top of the well creates an odd, eerie moaning sound.  The moonlight slants into the well, illuminating the rope so that it looks like a bright strand of spidersilk.  The air at the bottom is rank, smelling of mud and mold.  A narrow tunnel in the wall leads north under the lake.",
