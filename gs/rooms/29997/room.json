      "The remains of a bar the height of a tall giantman bisect the cavernous hall.  Spattered with raven droppings, the bar is bared to the elements by the crumbling roof, and the aurora's ghostly glow plays over the hall's interior.  Sharply pungent, the tang of spilled mead fends off the odor of char, but it has left the floorboards tacky in places."
