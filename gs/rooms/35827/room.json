      "Large bay windows open onto the main thoroughfare, their panes capturing the spectral bustle of Naidem while hues of coral and blue from the aurora-washed sky spill inward.  An iron-footed cloth mannequin dressed in a corset vest stands near the glass, its outline softened by the glow of nearby wall sconces.  Bathed in a mingling of window light and candle flame, a cloth-draped service counter displays several signs, while a silver-framed oil portrait hangs along the wall to complete the setting."
