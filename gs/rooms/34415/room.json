      "Bright colors explode from the various racks and stands of costumes that fill the room.  Piled under a large window, crates of masks lay half open, spilling their contents out over the floor.  A chest of props and other performance items sits open next to a huge wall mirror.  Draped over a pair of chairs, lengths of brilliant material cascade gracefully across the marble floor."
