      "The cliffside road diverges, climbing toward an overlook to the northwest and proceeding eastward to follow the bend of the bluffs.  Small stones and gravel clatter down the rock face, lending a clacking percussion to the music of the sea birds and the tides.  A brave alder tree, stunted and growing askew, leans out over the land's edge as if peeking out over the dizzying drop to the beach below."
