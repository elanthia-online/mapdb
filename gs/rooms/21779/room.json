      "A faint trace of residual magic tingles your fingertips as you cross the threshold of this workshop.  A domed window in the ceiling lets in bright sunlight that shines directly upon a well-worn and slightly charred desk strewn with various parchments and notes.  The walls are lined with shelves and cabinets which contain beakers, flasks, and decanters of multi-colored liquids that sparkle in the light."
