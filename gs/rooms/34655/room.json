    "description": [
      "Heavy velvet curtains of charcoal silk with green fringes obscure the shop's windows, leaving the work of lighting it to a series of candles in pierced bronze lantern holders.  Gowns and coats on mannequins along the perimeters of the showroom suggest a singular talent for the tailor's craft, embodying a variety of styles, fabrics, and cuts.  Several hooks hold completed garments, but it appears that the predominance are made to order.  A grey and green door leads to a studio set off from the main room."
