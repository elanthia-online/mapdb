      "At the foot of a bluff traversed by rough-hewn fieldstone steps, the path ends.  A stand of aspens gather to the northwest, their silvery leaves fluttering in a light breeze playing in the moonlight.  At the top of the steps, a shadowy fringe of pines seems to look down on the oaks, ashes, and aspens with a disdainful air, while huge ferns and hostas guard the stair with their imposing fronds.",
