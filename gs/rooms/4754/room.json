      "Scattered shards of bark and broken branches litter the old pathway.  Nearby the trunk of an ancient oak has been damaged by a strong force, its bark torn away in a series of deep claw marks.  Crystalline sap fills the wounds, running down the side of the old tree like tears.  A clump of matted fur, dark and wiry, lies trapped between two slivers of wood."
