      "Following the curve of the temple yard, a yellow-bricked walk proceeds beneath an arching bower heavy with fiery rose-marrow blooms.  Clinging to the outer wall is a stone longhouse that, despite age, is neatly kept.  Reflections off of the windows of the nearby fane cast pools of golden light amidst banks of low-growing flaeshorn dotting the lawn.",

Clinging to the outer wall is a stone longhouse that, despite age, is neatly kept.  Banks of low-growing flaeshorn dot the lawn, reduced by the darkness to little more than verdant shadows."
