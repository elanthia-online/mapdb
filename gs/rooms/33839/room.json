      "Plum-colored buoys crafted from haon casks frame the ebony pier, the hollow vessels bound with braided ropes leading up to the latticed arches canopying the dock in ivy-draped curtains.  A dual-wheeled wooden cart has been parked upright against the sable-trellised arch, the wood affixed to a framework of blackened iron.  Suspended from the lacquered crossbeams is a vine-framed haon sign, the placard chained to several lanterns of blown glass ensconced in faenor filigree."
