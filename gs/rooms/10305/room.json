    "description": [
      "Thick beams shore up the sturdy walnut lattice directly overhead.  The lattice allows extra illumination and air to filter down from above while providing a sturdy walking surface for those moving about the second floor of the inn.  Directly to the north, a huge marble fountain burbles pleasantly in the center of a spacious courtyard, and thick honeysuckle vines shaped into a wide hedge perfume the air.  A carved walnut door, the entrance to a sleeping room, resides on the south wall."
