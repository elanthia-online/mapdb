      "A treacherous path of slick mud is the only way in or out of this dreary spot, and the low carpet of thick grey fog that is blanketing the entire grotto only makes it worse.  Jet black dragonflies silently zig-zag their way about the mire, their forms quite frantic compared to the slowly moving waterbugs gracefully crossing the surface of the nearby swamp."
