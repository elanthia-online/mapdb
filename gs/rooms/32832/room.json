      "Stale air fills this dark, cubic chamber of unadorned granite with a dust covered floor.  A tunnel offers some progress south, though no light comes from the opposite end, making it impossible to determine how long it may be.  At floor level, a crawlspace leading out has been blocked on the other side to prevent passage."
