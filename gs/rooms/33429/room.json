      "Several small bull's-eye windows set at regular intervals line the outer walls, each outlined in gleaming brass.  The area resembles a ship's cabin, complete with an aperture leading to the west, and a silver and brass hatch with a discreet teak ladder in the ceiling.  Centered over a rattan couch is a narra-framed oil painting, and a sextant hangs next to a highly figured koa door.  Intricate marquetry in koa, teak, mahogany, and narra depicts a giant kraken in the middle of the floor."
