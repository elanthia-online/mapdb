      "Flapping like pennants, clothing hanging from crisscrossing lines sways in the ocean-borne breeze that slips through the tightly packed warehouse to the south.  Modest homes huddle together in the shadows of the larger structures across the street, their bright orange-red roofs dark under the cover of night.  Squatting amid the domiciles, a small shop sits open to customers."
