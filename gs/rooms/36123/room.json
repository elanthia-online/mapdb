      "The austerity of the room makes it a perfect setting for the house officers to carry out their duties.  The walls are panelled by unfinished wooden slabs cut from the great oaks of the lower forest.  The filing cabinet, bookcase, and desk, though lacquered, are of the same rough wood.  A simple rug covers the floor, and the only decoration present is three golden statuettes--a gavel, an abacus, and a quill pen--arrayed along the far wall."
