    "description": [
      "Oppresive enough to make breathing hard, the air's humidity releases itself in fat drops of condensation on jungle plants' leaves.  No surface is completely dry, not even the bark underfoot.  Tiny splashes plink on the edge of hearing, their rhythm a counterpoint to the ribbits of bright, motley-colored frogs under the leaves of ferns and on the trunks of trees."
