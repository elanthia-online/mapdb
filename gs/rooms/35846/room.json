    "description": [
      "A culmination of briars, brambles, and branches are twisted skillfully to conform to the design of a skilled artisan, forming an overlapping, angular design throughout the interior of this small dwelling.  Dark liquid drips from a large, sagging branch curling along the apex of the domed ceiling, making an audible *plop* as each drop falls into a wide bowl atop a haphazard makeshift workbench.  Both the heat of a kiln and chill of winter meet here from different parts of the hovel."
