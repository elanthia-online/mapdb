      "The black-brown walls encroach upon the passage, stones jutting from the sides as the corridor narrows.  Aging oak doors to the northeast and southeast stand ajar, their rusted hinges locking them in place.  Shadows shroud the rooms beyond the decaying portals, unwilling to reveal the secrets that they have held for so long."
