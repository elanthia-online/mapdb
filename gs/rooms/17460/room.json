      "Drippings from several melted candles are congealed on the bottom of a cairn, which is constructed from an assortment of brightly hued smooth stones and situated between two sassafras trees.  Pale yellow curtains adorn the windows of a blue-thatched stone cottage.  Flanking both sides of its doorway are twin steins with open lids painted in a deep crimson.  Prickly brambles with thimble-shaped fruits have been carefully planted and nurtured along the front and sides of the stone hut."
