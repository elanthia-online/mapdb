      "The rib-vaulted ceiling is higher here to accommodate a tall granite obelisk that stands on a slightly raised circular dais at the precise center of the hall.  Soft golden light brings a glow to the area from lit torch-filled iron sconces mounted to the rune-carved columns that stand in a protective circle around the monument, along with smooth marble benches that allow visitors a place to rest as they consume the runes inscribed upon it."
