      "Rough white stucco walls rise from a white limestone floor.  Just above a large granite boulder hangs an ancient Tehiri ritual mask, and a swirl-painted white stucco ceiling completes the picture.  A simple cloth mannequin and a hammered copper hanging rack stand side by side in the middle of the room."
