      "Dark shadows and cobwebs deepen the length of this corridor, with an odd displacement of cool air in spots, as though updrafts seep through the solid rock walls and flooring.  Dark glyphs blend in the dim lighting, making them difficult to discern.  A northeast branch leads gradually uphill towards a slightly brighter area."
