      "Floor-to-ceiling mahogany bookcases line the walls of the library, with several plump dark leather armchairs scattered in loose semi-circles across the ebon marble and mahogany parquet floor.  A moss-covered slab of slate sits near a marble and mahogany fireplace, and a cherrywood arch leads out."
