      "The deck is partially bisected by the ship's broken main mast, but still overshadowed by what remains of the shrouds.  Decaying lines cast foreboding patterns of shadow over a hatch that permits access into the partially submerged hold.  The rush of the tide beckons from the gloom below, and in a narrow square of sunlight, white foam stands out against a backdrop of surging black water."
