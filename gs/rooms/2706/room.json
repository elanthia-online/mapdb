      "Clutching to either side of a deep split in the snowfield, a narrow ice bridge remains as the sole survivor of an avalanche crashing into a cliff face.  Black boulders stick out of the blindingly white freeze, trying desperately to add some color to the bleak landscape.  Long scratches start at the middle of the bridge stretching down its side towards the gorge, ending at a climber's pick half buried in the ice."
