      "Bookcases rise from floor to ceiling and nearly encircle the entire room.  Only a heavy oak door and two windows, each rising from a cushioned window seat to the ceiling, interrupt this overwhelming collection of knowledge.  Several comfortable chairs and ottomans are scattered throughout the room awaiting those who care to take a journey through the histories and literature of your Elanthian lands that line the shelves."
