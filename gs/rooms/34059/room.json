      "Rearing basilisk statues proceed down the length of the hallway, staring down from niches along its even march.  Their jeweled eyes glint in the torchlight illuminating the passage.  Pillars of glaes twined with intricate golden tracery stretch up into the darkness, uniting into arches far overhead.  Underfoot, the floor tiles are slabs of igneous stone, evenly fitted together to show nary a seam.  Double doors in the eastern wall are framed by concentric rings of gilt."
