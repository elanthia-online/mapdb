      "A lattice-worked mistwood awning expands over the terrace entry, the crisscrossing slats entwined by a thicket of climbing vines that twist into a canopy of deep green foliage.  Lace-like ivory blossoms cling to the reedy limbs of five persimmon trees surrounding a silvery marble refectory table centered on the pale stone floor.  On alternating sides of a narrow path, angular glass lanterns and azalea bushes lead to a tranquil pond nestled in a bed of rain lilies."
