      "This corner of the workshop is less cluttered than the rest, and there are intricate sigils etched into the floor in a circular pattern.  The chandelier overhead contains only a single candle, but its light is reflected towards the floor by a variety of large mirrors mounted to the edge of the chandelier, bathing the area in intense light.  Scorch marks can be seen marring the walls in various places, and there is what appears to be the imprint of a taloned claw on the ceiling.",
      "The intricate sigils etched into the floor have been marred by childlike drawings of dungeons and dragons, the adventure following the circular pattern of the seals.  An abundance of candles heavily sway upon the chandelier overhead, causing searing arcs of light to focus across the haphazard scorch marks already marring the walls.  Each mark is met with similar measured horizontal lines set into the stone, and are annotated with a smudged name written in paint."
