      "A rectangular table of ebonwood has been carved with an elaborate map, the geographical points of interest covered in numerous tomes and aged scrolls veiled in pale dust.  Floor-to-ceiling bookcases enclose the wide room, each filled beyond capacity with volumes streaked in rust-colored flakes, the containers threatening to topple over upon a pair of velvet chaises.  Half-hidden beneath a heavy curtain is a spherical orb of crystal, the ball occasionally flickering in motes of crimson."
