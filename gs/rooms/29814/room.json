      "At odds with the grungy exterior, the interior of the tent is gently glowing with a variety of lit candles casting a golden light over the sparse furnishings and large oval rug of silver-threaded linen.  Forming a centerpiece in the middle of the shop is a large polished silver candelabra, proudly displayed atop a wooden platform.  A tent flap flutters in the breeze, offering an exit to the village."
