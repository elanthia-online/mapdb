      "Transforming the opulent space, wooden beams of roughly hewn modwir are installed under the vaulted ceiling, causing the pendant lanterns to cast lattice-like shadows upon the floor.  Alternating oak and pine planks create a false wall designed to hide some of the white marble, its face covered in a chaotic mural in bright colors.  Protected by guards, tellers work from a pair of high counters, a potbellied stove resting between them."
