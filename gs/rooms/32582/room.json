      "Origami clouds and sea birds meander above a linen-draped natural blonde oak table, the sideboard encircled by several rope-strung chairs crafted from faded fishing nets.  Sea kale-encircled planters of fresh flora are scattered along the perimeter of the shop, each container flanked by a capybara-shaped watering can situated below rain chains of hammered copper.  The bamboo-set walls of the room display dozens of sketches, the drawings depicting life from Caligos Isle and beyond."
