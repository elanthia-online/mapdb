      "Hammocks are strung between wooden posts down the length of the long room, a tenebrous procession not leavened by the windowless charcoal-colored walls.  Beneath each hammock sits a footlocker secured by a heavy steel lock.  A few personal effects lend needed spirit to the dormitory, from a handful of bone dice sitting atop one of the lockers to a small leather bracelet threaded through the knots of one hammock."
