      "The silvery sky illuminates the slope of The Krag as a chilling wind blows down the valley formed by the eastern slope of Sentoph Mountain and the western slope of The Krag.  Below, a steeply sloped wall leads to the top of a rockslide at the southern end of the Twin Canyons, while to the southeast a trail climbs towards Krag's Peak which towers several thousand feet away.  Across the canyon Sentoph's peak reaches nearly as high into the night sky.",
