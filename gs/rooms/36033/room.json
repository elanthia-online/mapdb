      "Wide and flat at its crest, the hillock forms an open gathering place where a large blazing bonfire burns at the center in a steady column of rising heat.  Steps descend the slope at each ordinal point, their lines cutting clean paths into the surrounding grass.  Carved benches and flat-topped boulders fitted with sheepskins provide seating around the fire, while river reed baskets filled with sticks rest nearby for tending the flames.  One edge overlooks the rolling grasslands, while the opposite side opens toward Khesta 'Dahl."
