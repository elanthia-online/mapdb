      "Shivering timbers quake and quaver with each assault of the waves as if the entire ragged structure of old nails and older wood might collapse with the next blow.  The pilings are crooked, either from poor craftsmanship or because the tide has shifted them in whatever moors them down below.  The answer to that question is a futile one, as the waters are as lightless as they are deep."
