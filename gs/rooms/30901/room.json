      "An open anteroom offers entrance to the Teras Isle Bard Guild through a stone arch covered with clinging vines dripping with flowers.  The anteroom is less a traditional room than it is a patio, and it features a splendid view of the town sprawling below with its red clay tile roofs and colorful foliage.  Wide stone tiles provide flooring that is as cool as it is attractive."
