      "A well-used fireplace, several comfortable leather armchairs, and a wide carpet of geometrically patterned silk are the only signs this room serves, in the off-hours, as part of a home.  It is otherwise laden with wares, which are draped over racks and displayed on mannequins, folded into baskets, and overflowing out of boxes and shelves.  A single wide doorway is almost lost amongst the excess."
