      "Painted wooden totems line the uneven path, carved into representations of meditating humanoids with colorful birdlike heads.  Each one is decorated with gemstones and feathers, and faces a matching counterpart between a row of shops on the opposite side.  An elderly Iyo woman dips her hand into a tiny wooden bowl before tracing her fingertips along one of the figures."
