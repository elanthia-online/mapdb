      "Granite walls punctuated with bas-relief columns support the great obsidian dome.  Rows of chairs separated by an aisle fan out across the floor.  Glass-covered niches hold an array of artifacts, all of them illuminated by the soft light from a multi-tiered chandelier.  A wide, polished stage presides over the elegant space."
