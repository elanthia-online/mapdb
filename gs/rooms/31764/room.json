      "Sprawling down the southwestern slope, wavy grasslands provide home to small dwellings with thatched rooves that are sporadically spaced throughout the neighborhood.  Beyond the homes, high wrought iron fences are a reminder that this burrow resides within town -- though space seems to do odd things beneath the twilight-touched sky.  Fomorian chokeberry shrubs grow in russet clusters along the steep incline that supports the hill's summit barrow, the berry laden plants continuing southwest where the dense woods darken."
