      "Moonlight filters through the branches of a pomegranate tree hanging over one tall wall of this open air cafe.  The enclosed courtyard is ringed with partitioned alcoves and tables, and lebbek latticework arches overhead, connecting large swathes of sun-faded cotton.  Lit incense censers clutter the tabletops, casting a heavy haze of scented-smoke across the area, and dozens of lamps bring a dim illumination.  A tall cafe proprietor stands behind a counter covered in numerous braziers, coffeepots, cups, and bottles.",
      "A low, arched door grants entrance to a courtyard ringed with partitioned alcoves and tables.  The lamps here are lit both day and night, and the calm, dreamy atmosphere seems to blur the edges of time and place.  Here and there, tabletops are littered with braziers, coffeepots and cups, along with small glasses that offer stronger poisons."
