    "description": [
      "A wide archway opens into a spacious hall with strikingly grained mahogany walls that climb into soaring rafters.  High above, a large dome of stained glass displays four messenger birds flying in from the cardinal directions to a center emblem displaying the entwined letters T and C.  In the center of the hall, a polished tanik dance floor is flanked by groups of chairs arranged in small conversational groupings.  A pair of paneled mahogany doors framed in dark blue velvet curtains mark the northern wall."
