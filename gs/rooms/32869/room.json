      "Cracks in the granite-tiled floor, some small and some not, have been mostly hidden by the careful arrangement of a tufted emerald velvet divan with several missing buttons and matching wide, scallop back chairs with scuffed, dark walnut end tables in between.  Bookcases and curio cabinets backed with blackened mirrors line one wall, the faint scent of old books clinging to them still.  Gold and bronze damask curtains, fraying a little at the edges, are partially drawn over a large window on the far side of the room from a pair of paneled sliding doors."
