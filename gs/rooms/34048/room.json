      "A majestic cascade of steps joins the western gallery of the hall with its southern mate.  Underfoot, the stones are beautifully inlaid with braids of dark gold that flank inset cubes of vivid blue glaes.  Carved penguins, mules, and snowbirds cavort over the face of the wall, the ornate menagerie flanking a mural occupying much of its span."
