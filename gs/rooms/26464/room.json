      "Water-warped oak boards run from floor to ceiling, their wavy faces are pockmarked with rusty nails and the seams between are filled with fresh tar.  Dust swings lazily back and forth from the rafters as an exterior breeze invades the shop from the open teak door, while golden light pools upon the distorted floorboards from lanterns hung to either side of a few crooked stone steps that lead into the backroom.  A hollow manatee skull hangs over the counter and creates shadows upon the smooth surface."
