      "All along the watchtower's crenellated rooftop are signs that struggle, and not the desert, ended its dominance over this stretch of the Sea.  The shattered remains of a wine bottle glint, green as grass, from a pile of fine sand in one corner.  An arrowhead is lodged in between two blocks of stone, although its shaft has been devoured by the elements.  Over the whole scene, the wild wind howls, low and mournful."
