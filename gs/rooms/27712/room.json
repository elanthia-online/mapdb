      "The wide South Wall looks down over the well-traveled confined of Bootlegger's Alley, which skirts between the wall and several of the most-patronized businesses in the city.  Across the alley to the north lie the grounds of House White Haven, while the view to the south is dominated by impenetrable forest.  Immediately to the east is the western barbican tower of the city's South Gate, which offers access only via an impossibly high window."
