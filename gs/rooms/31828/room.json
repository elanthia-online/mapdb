      "The river disappears underground at the foot of a rock formation to the west.  A makeshift dock of rotten logs lashed together with vines floats at the wooded water's edge.  The ground cover on the shore is thick, but a rough-hewn path can be made out, winding its way up from the dock and disappearing past the tree line."
