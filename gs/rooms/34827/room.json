      "The scorched stone walls of this hall are layered with numerous shields, carved and chased with grooves in equally varied patterns.  Ethereal flames lick at the remnants of two tapestries that flank a twisted crimson ora podium facing toward the scorched remains of wooden pews that now litter the floor amid piles of blackened bone and grey ash."
