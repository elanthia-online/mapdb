      "Burlap sacks weighted with grains, coffee, and sugar are lashed to the bulkheads behind nets of hemp rope, keeping them dry and out of the way.  Oaken barrels are stacked to the ceiling, each branded with a makers mark identifying the various spirits within.  An assortment of crates waiting to be organized sits at the ramp leading up out of the cargo hold."
