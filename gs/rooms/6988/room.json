      "A small stream tumbles over the cliff face here.  Over the ages the stream has cut a bit of a hollow out of the sheer wall, allowing the roadbuilders a bit of purchase into the face.  Although the going is steep, the road continues through a series of switchbacks which climb to the top of the plateau above."
