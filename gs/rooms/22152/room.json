      "Spiraling up, the staircase leads from the hallway to a small attic room.   A thin layer of dust coats a large stack of boxes, chests and sacks stored against the wall.  Sunlight filters in through a small linden-framed window, tiny particles dancing in the air.  A series of footprints lead away from the area, their shapes and sizes indicate the variety of frequent visitors."
