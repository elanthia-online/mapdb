      "Leaving the sheltering cliff walls behind, the boardwalk stretches in an incline towards an outcropping to the north, while pebbled walkways dart into the surrounding grasses to connect small homes to its smooth planks.  Glistening in the sunlight, mica-flecked white sands fill the expanse between the sheltering dunes and the turquoise water that laps at the beach.  A large, a smooth grey boulder interrupts the boardwalk, which splits around the monstrosity and reconnects on its opposite side.",
