      "A towering idol of crudely carved stone stands with outstretched wings at the cave's end, features scantly lit by the phosphorescent fungi thriving in the moist darkness.  Warm, mineral-heavy water drips from above, trailing down the statue's face like tears.  Beneath its raised dais are heaped bowls of cracked porcelain and tarnished brass of a dozen different makes.  They are filled with ash and incense remnants alongside other offerings of fruit and stolen coin."
