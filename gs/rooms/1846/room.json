      "It is cool and dark under the bridge, and the rushing river drowns out the sounds of the city above.  Something twitches in the darkness, where the bare earth meets the stone.  Off to one side, a small group of grimy, shabbily-dressed dwarves sits in a circle, mumbling quietly at one another.",
