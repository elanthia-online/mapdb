      "Cigar smoke hangs heavily and perpetually in the air of the gaming room.  A sign hangs above each of the entrances, a fir door and a pine door, reading, \"Silverback Jack's.\"  Various tables are scattered around the area holding an assortment of cards, dice, and other gambling accoutrements.  Displayed prominently on one of the slightly curved walls is a dart board, hundreds of tiny, dart-sized holes peppering the wall around it.  A single dart has permanently wedged itself in a brass refreshments cart situated nearby."
