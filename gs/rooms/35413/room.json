      "Sturdy wooden beams frame the stall, their surfaces darkened by years of handling and exposure.  Woven baskets sit atop a painted hunter green counter, brimming with dried fruits, nuts, and bundles of fragrant herbs tied with twine.  Small clay jars, their wax-sealed lids marked with trade sigils, line the back shelf in neat rows.  Beneath the counter, burlap sacks rest against the stall's supports, their coarse fabric cinched tight with knotted rope.  The scent of preserved citrus and crushed leaves lingers in the air."
