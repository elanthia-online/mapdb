      "The natural stone ceiling overhead slopes downward as the underground road dwindles into a narrow corridor.  Nestled into the wall is an iron-bound spruce hatch framed by slim veins of black and white minerals that branch through the otherwise unremarkable stone of the wall.  Near a pair of cross-braced iron doors, a cylindrical skylight is carved vertically into the ceiling, offering limited lighting, but most of that duty is given over to pine pitch torches spaced along the way.  Hanging from one wall is a black tapestry embroidered with white snowflakes.",
