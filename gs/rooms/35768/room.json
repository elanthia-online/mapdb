      "Ruined chests and dilapidated coffers lie half-submerged in brackish pools, their frames and banding eaten by saltwater.  Coins corroded past the point of worthlessness cascade across waterlogged planks, mingling with burst velvet pouches whose threads have frayed to ghostly wisps.  Crumpled goblets, mostly copper but a few silver, lie scattered about, and a rust-stained crown with its gems pried out rests off-kilter on a rotted beam nearby."
