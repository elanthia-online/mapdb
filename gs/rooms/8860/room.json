      "The narrow alley, shaded by the overhanging eaves of the stone and wood buildings that rise on all sides, is full of debris, piles of rags and filth.  A broken wooden chair, an old crate and a trash barrel are piled to either side of the smoke-stained oaken door that leads into the back of the building to the south."
