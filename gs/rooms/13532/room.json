      "The polished mahogany of the high, arching ceilings in this chamber is a stark contrast to the alabaster stone of the reinforcing ribbed vaults.  Dangling from the center vault is a gleaming chain of silver links, suspending a softly glowing globe of crackled glass.  A silver-threaded tapestry hangs next to a spindly black willow table that is pushed against the wall.  Opposite the entry door, the area widens considerably to allow space for a dramatic staircase of silver-flecked white marble."
