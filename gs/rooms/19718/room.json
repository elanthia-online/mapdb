      "This is the chamber of the Great Gnoll, the political leader of the Gnolls of Cavernhold.  Hanging on the back wall of the room are charts and maps of many areas outside of Cavernhold, some of which are quite unfamiliar to you.  Scores of keys hang on finely crafted key racks which are firmly mounted to the west wall of the room.  A small bed, a large table surrounded by twelve chairs, a huge trunk and an armor stand make up the furnishings of this chamber."
