      "Large, diamond-shaped vellum lanterns crown strands of smaller luminaries threaded through the branches overhead, and the ribbons holding them in place accentuate the fiery hues with flashes of bronze and copper.  Along the ground, the bright shapes cast by the lanterns sway with every breeze that brushes through the trees, adding the soft whisper of a rustle to the gurgling of a nearby stream."
