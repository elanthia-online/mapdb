      "Halfling and giantkin vendors hawk their wares along the sides of the busy thoroughfare, the former cohort frequently standing atop crates and soapboxes so as not to be lost in the crowd.  A troop of half-krolvin trappers makes their way through the throng, coins jingling in their pockets.  Though drifts of fresh-fallen snow dot the roadside, a wrought iron street lamp at the corner stands near a cleared path, occasionally serving as a resting post for weary travelers.",
      "Various halfling vendors hawking their wares block your way for a moment.  You notice a number of giantmen and dwarves heading north, coins jingling in their pockets.  A twisted, wrought-iron street lamp at the corner keeps an inebriated halfling from meeting the pavement.",
