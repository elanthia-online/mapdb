      "The enticing aroma of baked goods wafts in from the south, luring a steady stream of travelers toward a bakery there that stands a story taller than the other businesses along the street.  Several halflings coming from that direction clutch tarts with a delectable variety of fillings in parchment wrappings, the pastries still piping hot.  Near a windblown leather tent sporting a sign etched with carved logs, an alley juts off of the main drag.",
      "An enticing aroma wafts in from the south as several large groups of chattering halflings head off in that direction.  To the east, the road turns into a narrow alley."
