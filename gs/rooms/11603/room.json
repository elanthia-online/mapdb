      "This narrow, natural cavern appears to have been formed over the centuries by water seeping down from the giant boulder overhead.  The cavern has been worked by hand.  Tarred timbers reinforce the walls and a few thick planks make the floor somewhat less irregular.  Water continues to trickle down from the boulder, rotting the planks and making them slippery."
