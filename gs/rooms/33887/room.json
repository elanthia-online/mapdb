      "A vivid myriad of cobbled footwear are displayed behind the glass of a jadewood-shuttered pale stucco shop, the pompes and ankle-boots resting upon wreaths of velvet-crafted peonies.  Jade-leafed topiaries flank the mottled walkway, the interwoven trunks cradling the shapes of scissors and shoe forms dotted with tiny blossoms, each one nestled in a wide pot tied with a length of measuring tape.  An ivy-draped lamp post stands behind the greenery, the rectangular base painted with a polychromatic array of dyes."
