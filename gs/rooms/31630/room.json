      "Silvery ghost eryngiums mingle with dusky bluish grey globe thistles as they spill out of Bittermere Woods, framing a tangled amber grass-lined trail.  Enormous wrought iron lanterns molded into toadstools house luminous blue spheres on their underside to create decorative pools of light on the cobblestones that have been disturbed by the encroaching flora.  Slanted at angles, stone buildings share load-bearing walls amid curving arches and dark alleyways that lead towards the inner ring of the town."
