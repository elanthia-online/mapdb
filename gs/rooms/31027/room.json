      "Smooth, onyx-swirled white marble walls enclose this large, rectangular space.  The ceiling houses three evenly spaced domes, and the center dome contains a cupola with a gold-framed oculus.  Sunlight pours through the oculus, glistening off the waters of the elegantly carved marble fountain directly below it.  The edge of the fountain is lined with brightly colored flowers, adding their heady scent to the entire area.  Spiraling columns line tiled walkways, which radiate outward from the centralized fountain."
