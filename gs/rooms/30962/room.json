      "Thinning out as it descends from the promenade, elfin thyme grows in sparse, mottled patches, as the travertine cobbles are fitted more tightly together at the entrance to the sprawling courtyard.  Ornate facades with etched pillars and wide windows are carved into the cliff face, the peak of which is dominated by the shadow of the Tower of Pentas.  Bright light spills from the open entrances of various shops, their cheery glow inviting in the cool night."
