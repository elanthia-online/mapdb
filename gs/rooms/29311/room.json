      "Slightly cramped, this whimsical shop boasts a colorful assortment of dice displayed via several trays, cases, and shelves.  The faint aroma of sandalwood wafts through the air, emanating from a simple brass censer tied to a tent pole.  A varnished walnut stand has been placed next to a canvas-covered table, upon which rests a small papyrus card in front of a large goldstone bowl."
