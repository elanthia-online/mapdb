      "The jungle's swaying banyans and strangler figs stand away from the base of a towering pinnacle as if in deference.  Black and foreboding, the spire of rock stretches skyward like a crooked talon, its tip lost in swirling mists.  Though the stone wall at its base is replete with crags to serve as handholds and footholds, it is slicked with mist and rain, and the exotic vines clinging to it are as likely to snap treacherously as to provide purchase."
