      "Unaffected in the least by the blistering heat of the passage, a pair of statues stand on either side of the narrow walkway.  One hunkers against the wall as if readying to climb, its stone talons biting into the blocks as it glares back over its shoulder with a visage so fearsome that it could curdle the guts of the strongest of adventurers.  The other statue looms large and gazes down with a loathsome stare, wings and arms outstretched as scraps of decaying flesh dangle from its talons."
