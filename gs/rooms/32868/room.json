    "description": [
      "Beautiful rugs, worn thin in spots but still largely intact, and colorful tapestries soften the cold, exposed stone of the large entryway.  A long hall extends north from a heavy wooden door with panes of leaded glass, its walls lined with painted landscapes, and leads to a wrought iron and glass arch at its end.  A cordoned-off flight of stairs leads to the upper chambers of this once great home, and to the west a wide doorway draped with heavy velvet curtains opens into a modest sitting room."
