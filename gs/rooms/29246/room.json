      "A marble staircase cuts a diagonal across the back side of the building, leading upwards to the second story.  On one side of the staircase is a copper railing and on the other, an unobstructed view through the glass wall to the city outside.  Several arches lead off from the main platform floor, each one leading into a more contained chamber."
