      "Coral walls enclose the spacious chamber, its surfaces mottled with encrusted growths and fissures lined with glowing algae that pulse softly.  Some stone racks hang from a series of low ledges.  Strands of kelp sway from the ceiling above, their lengths heavy with shell charms that ripple as they catch the gentle currents.  A seagrass drape conceals a narrow passage, fibers drifting in steady motion.  The floor inclines and dips with the reef's natural folds."
