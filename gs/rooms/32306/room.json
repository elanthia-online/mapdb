      "The road births a smaller trail that meanders southeast through a small plot of untended farmland.  A scarecrow, his shoulders stained white with droppings, marks the fork.  Crows have left glittering prizes--red and blue glass, silver tinsel, and even a few pieces of obsidian--at the base of the mannequin as if in tribute to his ineffectiveness."
