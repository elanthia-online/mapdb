      "Scaffolding embraces two of the townhouses on the south side of the lane, the buildings bearing partial coats of fresh whitewash, but with no painters around at this hour.  Across the street, a row of potted boxwood shrubs forming a hedge between two of the houses appears to be half trimmed.",
      "Scaffolding embraces two of the townhouses on the south side of the lane, where workers perch at different levels to whitewash the buildings.  Paying more attention to the wisecracking of the painters than to her own work, a gardener trims a row of potted boxwood shrubs between two of the houses across the street."
