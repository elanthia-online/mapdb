      "Textured ivory silk walls rise from a polished oak floor.  Just above a set of terra cotta jugs hangs an intricate knot-worked wall-hanging, and a glass-tiled vaulted ceiling completes the picture.  A twisted dark metal rack and a long mistwood counter stand side by side in the middle of the room."
