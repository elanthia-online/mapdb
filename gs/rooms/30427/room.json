      "Torches fitted into iron brackets illuminate the cavern in a semi-circular pattern that reflects off of the dripping walls and moist ground.  Placed upon a raised platform is a series of oilcloth-wrapped rough wooden crates and several copper-banded rough wooden casks.  Distantly, the sound of dripping water creates an almost musical backdrop that is occasionally drowned out by the distant sound of crashing waves."
