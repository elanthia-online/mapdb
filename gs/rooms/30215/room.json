      "Wide windows let in enough ambient light to brighten the entire room, and a polished teak counter is set just below the large skylight.  Neat stacks of canvas sails in a multitude of hues are displayed along one wall, and a variety of ropes are coiled along another.  Several examples of boatswain's chairs line the back wall, ranging from the impeccably made to a cobbled together item of light canvas and frayed rope."
