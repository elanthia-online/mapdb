      "Designed to be used for training, the courtyard is ringed with several devices for improving combat skills.  In the center is an arena of sand for practicing skills against opponents.  A set of racks rests against the south wall, storing several items of weaponry and armor.  Near the western wall, a wide stone staircase leads up to the door, giving entrance to the tower.  A selection of refreshments wait on a nearby table."
