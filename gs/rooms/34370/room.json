      "Streaming in from the east, a rancid miasma resembling a cross between rotten eggs and animal excrement makes breathing an arduous task.  Sizeable water drops rain down upon anything beneath the persistant seepage.  Previous attempts to illuminate these tunnels have proven undoubtedly futile, validated by rusty iron sconces with unused candles whose wicks weep with moisture."
