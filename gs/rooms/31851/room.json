      "A glazed burgundy-black vase sits upon an ebonwood table, framed by ring-bound swatches of fabric and tiny glass vials of dye.  Various wire forms have been arranged around a velvet-padded rack, the mannequins adorned with several ribbons and affixed with tiny metal blooms.  The faint sound of a music box echoes across the room, abruptly starting and stopping at its own leisure."
