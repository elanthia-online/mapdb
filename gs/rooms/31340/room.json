      "A massive blackened stump squats at the end of the path, its roots partially exposed as if the sheer force generated by the felling of its tree had forcibly yanked a portion of it from the soil below.  The tombstones are fewer here, when compared with the rest of the graveyard, and much older.  Some of the symbols on the stones themselves are nearly illegible, and here and there the stones have been broken or begun to crumble with the weight of years."
