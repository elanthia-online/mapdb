      "Four towers rise about this cavernous central chamber.  White marble veined in deep cinnabar, brilliant viridian, soft cobalt, and somber grey makes up their walls.  Far above, the roof is a simple diamond shape set diagonal to the towers.  Flanking the entry door, ornate vases hold a variety of jungle flowers, their scents adding a lush perfume to the grand space.  A nondescript office, on the far side of the chamber, is the only other break in the chamber's walls."
