    "description": [
      "Glimpses of a white road are all but consumed by wide-fronded ferns, straining saplings, and the expansionist tendencies of creepers with sunny yellow blossoms.  What remains of the sinuous stone span is cracked in places and bubbled and blackened in others, though the jungle's expansion has erased any other evidence of the cataclysm that doomed the roadway.  Parakeets, scarlet and blue and green, nest in cacao trees up a gentle hill, at bliss and ignorant of the land's ancient history."
