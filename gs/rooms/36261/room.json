      "Icicles dangle precariously along the sharply slanted roof of the lookout, the transparent ice encrusted along the reinforced ropes stretching down towards a northern post.  An iron-hinged telescope sits buried beneath thick layers of warg fur, the snow-dusted pile set beside the upside down crates.  A pair of spherical glass lanterns hang above, swaying in the ambient breeze before the sybil-shaped dart board and rack nailed to the rope-bound posts."
