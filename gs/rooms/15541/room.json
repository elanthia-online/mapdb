      "Rising from a pool of water is a stone marker, adjacent to the ruined remains of a paved stone road that is quickly consumed by underbrush before turning into a narrow footpath leading southeast.  Massive trees stand as lone sentinels, divided by swampy earth and pools of water, their great limbs stretching outward to form a thin canopy of leaf and hanging dull grey moss.  Splashing sounds are followed by ripples across the still muddy pools of water, the only clues to the swamp's inhabitants."
