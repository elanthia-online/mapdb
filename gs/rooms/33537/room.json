    "description": [
      "Overlapping one another, bright green triangles of canvas provide shelter to the wedge-shaped pen that is filled with blue-green grass and grazing roltons.  White picket fencing keeps the ovine denizens from wandering away, while baskets of sweet grass hold their attention.  Bells strung from red and yellow ribbons mark the entry gate, which leads back to the central viewing area of the glade."
