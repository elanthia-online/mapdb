      "Casting a pale glow throughout the coral tunnels, the silver-blue light of a large aelvashade bloom pulses along the cavern walls.  Strands of spindleleaf algae spiral from arcing walls above, their deep emerald and violet fronds swaying with the currents.  Tiny, glimmering fish weave through the glowing flora, their movements casting shifting patterns of light across the coral-encrusted pathways and the drifting shadows of the algae."
