      "Several frosted crystal orbs are suspended from wooden hooks that have been fixed into the walls.  A small copper-bound chest is placed on one side of the opening, while a woven frond basket rests on the other.  The air is cool, with an earthy scent filling the spacious area.  Soft carpets of woven moss cover the ground under a small white oak table.  A carved spiral staircase leads higher into the tree."
