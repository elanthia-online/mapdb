      "Azure paint peels from the ceiling in long stripes, which are caught by the thick layers of cobwebs that cling to the corners of the room.  Splintered wood is collected in a thick pile on the northern wall opposite a blackened circle on the southern wall where someone tried to start a fire.  Pushed against the eastern wall, a glass and brass display case appears to be unscathed by the long ago blaze."
