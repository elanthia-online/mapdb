      "Basalt rocks, slick and ragged, rise from a sand-ravaged ground littered with tangled clusters of lifeless kelp and seagrass.  Beyond the surrounding bubble of air is a murky ocean filled with imposing shadows from large aquatic beasts that pass just out of sight.  The acrid scent of the sea assaults your senses, and you sense that at any moment, the bubble could pop, and water could come rushing in."
