    "description": [
      "Nestled within a southwestern arc of the nautilus, this midsize cell is peppered with scores of acorn barnacles.  A meandering crack mars the southernmost wall, its edges rough and irregular, yet admitting no hint of light.  Powdery ivory sand drifts in gentle furrows underfoot, illuminated by the blue-green glow of a massive aelvashade bloom clinging to the ceiling."
