      "Rough scree makes footing on the basalt flat risky, with the jumble of rock and gravel mixed with gnarled, exposed roots of long-dead scrub brush.  Volcanic slopes tower in the moonlight to the northeast, while to the east, mist can be glimpsed rising over the terrain.  Overhead, bats dart by occasionally, leaving the soft whisper of their wings behind them.",
      "Rough scree makes footing on the basalt flat risky, with the jumble of rock and gravel mixed with gnarled, exposed roots of long-dead scrub brush.  Volcanic slopes loom through patchy fog to the northeast, while to the east, mist can be seen rising over the terrain.  In places across the bleak terrain, small mounds of prickly pear cactus sport bright yellow blooms above the plants' spiked foliage."
