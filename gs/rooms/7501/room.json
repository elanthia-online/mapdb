      "You are on a broad stone landing, with a series of wedge-shaped stone stairs fanning out before you.  As you look down, they are swallowed up by increasing darkness.  Two torches in crude iron sconces flicker off the clammy walls, casting a harsh, unrelenting light that illuminates a trapdoor just within reach above your head."
