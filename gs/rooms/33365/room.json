      "Pale golden yellow snow lilies sprout from around a wall of mottled grey stone, its overhang partially shadowing a slurry of ice and snow that trails down a shadowy stone-lined path.  Frost-swept clusters of ruffled clover blot the niveous surroundings with striking dollops of greenery.  A sturdy, nicely appointed cypress log cabin with a gabled roof is plunked among some blue-blushed winter roses and encircled by unruly crallisberry hedges."
