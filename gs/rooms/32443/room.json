      "Guarded by unyielding walls of dark basalt and a heavy steel portcullis, the castle yard is shielded from the sounds of the outside world and the highland gale.  A flagstone path proceeds eastward, cut from the same material as the walls.  It winds past empty horse troughs and several disused hitching posts that are green with a thick coating of moss."
