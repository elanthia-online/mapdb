      "Most of the items for sale in this room lie in a heap upon the floor.  Although the fire did not destroy many of the items, it did destroy the wooden shelves and the display case that housed them, thus dropping them into unordered piles on the floor.  There is a stack of spearpoints in the corner -- their shafts burned away."
