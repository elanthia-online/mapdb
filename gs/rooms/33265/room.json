      "This small room is cut off from the hustle and bustle of the rest of the building.  The parqueted floors are left unadorned, but the walls are decorated with elegant oil portraits of fashionable men and women showing off their footwear.  A maple writing desk is tucked into a corner of the room with a narrow-back chair behind it."
