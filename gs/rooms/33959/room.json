      "Large gashes are torn into the blackened, weather-soiled canvas tent walls.  Rusted iron poles struggle to keep what remains of the tent up.  At the back end is a rotten, black-stained bedroll with a lidless thanot footlocker half covered by the bedding.  Grass and molding moss have slowly begun to take over the rest of what remains here."
