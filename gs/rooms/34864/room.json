      "Delicate fronds of moisture-beaded ferns reach across the gem-lined border of a moonlit walkway as though hoping to caress the legs of passersby.  Dotted around and amongst them are multicolored mushrooms emerging from the rich, dark, and loamy soil.  From a nearby cluster of saplings, crickets lend their voices to the night with a series of plaintive chirps."
