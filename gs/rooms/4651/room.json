      "Cresting the top of the hill provides an ideal vantage point of the snow-capped mountains that tower in the distance and the town common spreading out below.  The wan glow of a moon peeks out from between two of the largest mountains, their perpetual misty clouds breaking apart to allow a thick beam of light.  Illuminated by the faint moonlight is a small clearing surrounded on three sides by thick ancient forest growth and a steep mountain slope in the remaining direction.",

The glowing ball of the sun peeks out from the perpetual mists that surround two of the largest mountaintops.  Off to the side, a small clearing is host to some ancient ruins and abandoned buildings.",

A spiral staircase winds around one of the large trees growing along the edge of the woodland."
