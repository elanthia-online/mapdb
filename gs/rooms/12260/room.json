      "If nothing else, the monks that occupied this monastery must have been a clean lot.  A huge shallow basin, lined with pink marble, occupies almost the entire area of this room.  The basin is obviously a bathing pool though it now stands empty of water, with a layer of dirt and refuse lining the bottom.  A small privy stands in one corner and a short stone wall affords some privacy there."
