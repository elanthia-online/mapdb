      "Moonlight barely illuminates the murky depths of a vast lagoon stretching out before the tumble of water rushing down from the plateaus above.  The nocturnal melody of the jungle serves as a striking companion to the surprisingly quiet sound of the bi-level falls cascading from the lowest outcropping to feed the pool.  Deep shadows help to almost completely conceal the presence of a cave hidden behind the ripple of the liquid curtain.",
      "A vast lagoon of brilliant blue depths stretches out before the tumble of water rushing down from the plateaus above.  The bi-level falls are surprisingly quiet as the water cascades from its lowest outcropping to feed the pool, and the ripple of the liquid curtain only partially conceals the shadows of a cave beneath the ledge.  Plumes of mist rise into the air constantly, casting glistening dew upon everything within close proximity."
