      "Inside the Music Library, shelves stretch from floor to ceiling on every wall.  Polished mahogany mahogany ladders fitted with rollers on the feet give access to the higher shelves.  A single chandelier provides the sole illumination.  Its impressive size and intricate branches hold innumerable candles, casting a soft, yet thorough light well suited to poring through the most poorly scribbled of hand-written musical manuscripts.",
