      "As the path passes beneath an arch created by an immense fig root, the darkness crowds in and the atmosphere is heavy with the smell of organic debris.  In a shadowed crevice, mushrooms grow, their spotted caps luminescent in the moonlight.  They stand jauntily, like a small army of soldiers dressed in brightly-colored heraldic garb.",
      "As the path passes beneath an arch created by an immense fig root, the light grows dim and the atmosphere is heavy with the smell of organic debris.  In a shadowed crevice, mushrooms grow, their caps spotted and tinted a bright vermilion red.  They stand jauntily, like a small army of soldiers dressed in brightly-colored heraldic garb."
