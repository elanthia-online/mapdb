    "description": [
      "Imposing crags and rock faces dominate the western segment of the plateau, but are far less treacherous than the perpetual lightning strikes that befall the higher elevations.  Extending nearly ten feet from the eastern edge is a narrow rocky shelf that stretches over a gaping cavity of the plateau.  Blending with the current sounds of wind, rain, and thunder is the unmistakable roar of a waterfall from somewhere far below.  A sharp descent leads into a smoky tunnel."
