      "A lone scrawny tree rises up from the grass.  Two large owls perch on the branches above, arguing between themselves and occasionally gazing impassively at you with eerily lambent eyes.  The tree might provide some shelter from the wind, but the respite from the chill is not worth sharing the company of the quarrelsome birds.",
      "A lone, scrawny tree rises up from the grass.  Two large black birds sit in the branches, mocking you from above with shrill squawks and raucous laughter.  The tree provides the only shade in the area, but the respite from the sun is not worth having to listen to the birds making fun of you."
