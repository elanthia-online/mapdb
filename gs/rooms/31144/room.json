      "Brightly shining torches illuminate the darker confines of the tunnel, the flames fitfully dancing as they are tugged by the wind that slips past the opening that leads to a subalpine glade.  Flecks of mica, feldspar, and quartz respond to the light, the granules winking like stars in the sky with each flicker of the torches' flames.  A gently sloping incline to the south leads deeper into the cavern."
