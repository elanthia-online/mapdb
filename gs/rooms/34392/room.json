    "description": [
      "A path cleared in the snowdrifts leads to and from a weathered pine dock that extends out over the southern side of the frozen pond.  Its surface is slick from a thin layer of ice formed by the morning's frozen dew.  A hole, big enough to fit a halfling, has been cut through the ice at the end of the dock, affording a glimpse into the murky depths of the pond.  Curious fish, seeking the warmth of the sun's light, cause the water in the hole to ripple.  A stone firepit sits near the opposite end of the dock."
