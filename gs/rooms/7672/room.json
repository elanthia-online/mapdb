      "Balanced on a narrow ledge, you perch uneasily between the starry sky above and the raging waves below.  Argent moonlight gilds the swells, turning the seafoam into silver filigree.  Far out to sea something rises from the water, but in the darkness the nature of the thing is impossible to distinguish.",
      "Balanced on a narrow ledge, you perch uneasily between the sky above and the raging waves below.  Gazing far out to sea you spy many soaring birds.  As they wheel and dive looking for their food, something rises out of the water and drags a helpless gull to its own doom.  The flock continues on, uncaring, unheeding."
