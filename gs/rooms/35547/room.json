      "Glowing strands of kelp cast flickering light over carved coral shelves cluttered with an odd assortment of trinkets and treasures.  Wax-sealed clay amphorae, mismatched buttons, chipped porcelain dolls' heads, and other peculiar castoffs spill from barnacle-crusted crates.  A tangle of fishnet drapes one wall, heavy with keys, gears, and other curios.  Overhead, an odd sculpture fashioned of rusting forks sways gently, presiding over the remnants of forgotten wonders."
