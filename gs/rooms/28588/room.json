      "Tiny golden stars appear to twinkle overhead, lit by the soft glow of wall sconces.  The entire arched ceiling has been painted in varying shades of blue and black, reminiscent of the night sky.  Wooden chairs surround a fair-sized round table with a small dome set in the center.  Ancient charts have been hung together on the wall to form a display."
