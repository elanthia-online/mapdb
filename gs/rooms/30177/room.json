      "On both sides of the large, open deck, some cannons point toward ports, each fitted with a wooden hatch.  A wooden mast fitted with a storm grey flyrsilk sail extends from the bottom of the ship skyward, a crows nest near its top barely visible from this angle.  The sound of the ships bell echoes, signaling a change of watch."
