      "Lush, interlaced canver trees cluster along a verdant bank, covered in numerous colonies of mushrooms and surrounded by patches of cattails and fiddlehead ferns.  Dangling from their branches, a plethora of pink-throated white blossoms provide a starkly contrasting canopy to the thunderheads that darken the sky.  Tiny golden and silvery fish dart around some soot-stained rafts tethered to a rugged wooden dock, in a constant race after each petal that falls into the current."
