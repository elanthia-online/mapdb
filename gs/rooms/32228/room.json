      "Five large stone sarcophagi form a makeshift semicircle around the circumference of the dais in the center of the hall.  The life-sized image of a paladin, dragoon, summoner, healer, and duelist in full armor has been painstakingly chiseled into the lid of each sarcophagus.  The tattered, moldy remains of five banners stand in the center of the circle, the faded cloth waving gently in the slightest breeze.  At the north end of the dias, an arched stone door is flanked by two torches."
