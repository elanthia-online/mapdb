      "The room is paneled in rough-hewn wooden planks, punctuated by long dark wood shelves stocked with multicolored folded tents.  Below the shelves is a row of evenly spaced bright silver hooks that boast a series of lanterns and torches above a red cedar trunk.  A low plank riser is covered with assorted containers.  A wooden pamphlet rack stands beside the entrance, offering a selection of tent upgrades."
