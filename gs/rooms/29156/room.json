      "Tie pilings, ranging in height and painted red, flank the sides of the pier, which is comprised of flat oak and teak boards.  Evenly spaced posts woven with bright red rope through them create makeshift guardrail that runs the length of the walking space.  Painted triangles, their uppermost points angling towards the surrounding tie-pilings, have black numbers ranging from 6 to 10 drawn at their centers."
