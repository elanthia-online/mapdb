      "Mimicking skylights, frosted glass panels framed in pine accents are anchored to the ceiling, diffusing the light of lanterns and creating a soft glow through the office.  Supported by darkened iron, the large desk is fashioned of a sturdy piece of dark-stained elm and stands prominently at the heart of the room.  Beyond the clerk-attended piece is a tapestry of winter landscapes that almost hides the marble walls."
