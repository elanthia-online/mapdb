      "A rivet-bound hand cart sits in front of an elongated glass window, the limestone building displaying stacks of colorful books amidst shelves of dried flowers and herbs.  Aged dark leather chairs are positioned on either side of the entrance, the seating draped in fringed blankets of maedatha, the fabric subtly concealing puncture marks across the arms.  A grouping of mahogany-framed easels form a half-circle further along the walkway, the canvases flanked by budding saplings nestled in clay pots."
