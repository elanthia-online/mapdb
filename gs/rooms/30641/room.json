      "Sounds from outside barely penetrate the thick granite walls, leaving the large auditorium in a silent hush.  Sunlight streams in through the large bay window in the west wall, adding to the ambience provided by a small brass chandelier, casting the room in a soft glow.  Dozens of chairs have been set up in rows, all facing towards a large podium placed near the north wall.  The eastern wall is one large mural, the only decoration in this room."
