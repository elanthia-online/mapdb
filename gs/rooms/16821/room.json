      "Three sleeping pallets have been hewn out of stone along each of the cell walls.  Etched into the stone above each bed are similar, yet very different runes.  One set thin and very precise, another stronger but less artistically drawn.  The third set imparts a feeling of foreboding and distress.  Set in the center of the room you see a stone pedestal."
