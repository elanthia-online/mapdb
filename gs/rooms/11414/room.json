      "The passage slants downward from the entrance in the cliff side.  It is damp in here and your feet have a little trouble gaining a good hold on the uneven floor.  Looking at the walls you see that some effort has been made to smooth the stone, but the attempts seem to have been made with primitive tools.  Away from the entrance you think you see the faint glowing of lichens and moss.  A slight stench pervades here."
