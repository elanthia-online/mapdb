      "All other sounds succumb to the deafening roar of the underground river, its sheer force shaking the stone walls and floor of the tunnel.  A dank odor drifts in the air, which has become thick with moisture.  The walls of the passage glisten slightly with the sheen of water that clings to their rocky surfaces."
