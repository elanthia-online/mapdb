      "Lofted braziers shed light throughout the umber tent, the warm glow illuminating the conical-shaped ceiling and the multicolored rugs that are scattered about the floor.  Stretched between the central support posts, several wrought iron hooks and river reed baskets are arranged at varying heights throughout the area, while a smooth wooden bench provides a resting place for weary customers.  A light arctic breeze tickles the air despite the warmth of the braziers above."
