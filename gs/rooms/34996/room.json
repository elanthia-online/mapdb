      "Winding drunkenly, the path passes beneath the shadow of a bluff hundreds of feet overhead.  Atop it stands a stone lighthouse that can be glimpsed from several vantage points along the ridge.  Murres have nested in the cragged rock face below the old stalwart and fill the sea air with their throaty cries."
