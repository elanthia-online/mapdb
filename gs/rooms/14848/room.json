      "The grass in this garden is tall and full, occasionally trodden at the edges of the path.  Wildflowers grow in several places amidst the grass and you even see a single cherry tree growing next to the fence.  Moonlight adds silvery highlights to the water spraying from the intricately carved marble fountain.",

Sunlight sparkles brilliantly upon the water spraying from the intricately carved marble fountain."
