      "The wide corridor is carpeted with a thick wool runner, its length covered with a complex pattern of leaves in rich tones of green.  A strip of dark flooring runs along each side, throwing reflections off its polished surface in response to alternating windows and sconces.  The carpet muffles steps, lending the hallway a serene hush.  At the corridor's end, two doors face each other, flanking a large painting hanging on the wall between them."
