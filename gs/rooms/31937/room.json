    "description": [
      "Toppled, vine-choked columns, crumbling ogee arches, and shattered limestone tiles serve as the last vestiges of an expansive, derelict structure.  Stone steps, pulverized to resemble a ribbed ramp, descend off the northern edge to a shallowly flooded path.  The glassy surface reflects the image of bare-boned trees hazed green with emerging buds, their gnarled roots obstacles to the waterlogged door tucked into the cracked base of the ruins."
