      "Frost-crested stones are artfully positioned along the decorative perimeter of the curving path, flanking a swirling sea glass mosaic that is firmly pressed into the central walkway.  The ornamentation terminates abruptly at a dense thicket of cypress trees, and the lively market area ahead widens into a section with plentiful wares."
