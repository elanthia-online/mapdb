      "Jagged divots pockmark the rocky coast, those crevices providing secretive hiding places for several varieties of tiny sea creatures.  Without any respite of flat shoreline, the waters pound ceaselessly against the middling-sized stones that peak and pitch like irregular splints, protecting the eastern sands against the constant tidal pressure of the sea.",
      "Silvery light glints off of the jaggy coastline, its pale glow illuminating a variety of glittering barnacles that cling to the dark rocks.  Splashing sounds rise and fall with the gentle flow of the tide, though its sources are hidden from sight by distance and the darkness of the waters."
