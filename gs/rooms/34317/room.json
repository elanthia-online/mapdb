      "Deep cracks in the earth serve as a drain system along the plateau's surface, preventing an overabundance of water build-up in the immediate vicinity.  Small insects slip through the fractures, some clawing frantically at the dirt as the apathetic liquid carries them off to an undisclosed tomb.  Nearby lightning strikes briefly illuminate an eastern bluff, but not long enough to reveal any pertinent details."
