      "The mixed odors of medicinal herbs and fresh blood are almost overpowering in here, where a large, bloodstained table stands in the center of the shack.  Fresh straw mercifully covers the floorboards beneath the table, and also partially fills a bucket that rests against one of the table's legs."
