      "Multiple pieces of stitched-together linens cover the area and drape down to the boardwalk's edges, forming a dim tunnel of planks, pillars, and cloth.  Through a few pinned-back sections of this linen canopy, the night sky is visible.  Small, rug-covered squares line the tunnel, offering additional space for market stalls.  This tunnel gives way to an open boardwalk with a wooden fountain at its center, surrounded by several cloth pillows and a series of lanterns.",
      "Multiple pieces of colorful, stitched-together linen cover the area and drape down to the boardwalk's edges, which paints this area in a soft, multihued glow during the day.  Small, rug-covered squares mark the path forward and offer additional space for market stalls.  These stalls give way to an open boardwalk with a wooden fountain at its center, surrounded by several cloth pillows and a series of lanterns."
