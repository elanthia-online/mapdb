      "Across from a wrought iron-framed bed fitted with a plump feather mattress, a lacquered mistwood dressing table is partially concealed behind a painted silk screen for privacy.  A framed painting of the hotel grounds hangs above the dark-stained poplar mantel of a stone fireplace, a bundle of pristine white birch logs stacked to one side.  Arranged as a reading nook in the corner, a well-worn leather chair with an octagonal ebony side table crowded with books is positioned by the window."
