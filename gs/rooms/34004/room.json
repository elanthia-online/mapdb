      "Colorful shutters painted bright white and trimmed in yellow and green stand open to allow the moonlight to fill the small space, while a bright blue door is propped open by a wedge to allow for easy entry.  Long rows of wooden hooks house a variety of packs and haversacks, while a spindle-armed coat tree supports a motley combination of cloaks and shawls.  Miscellaneous items fill a small wicker basket that is pushed against the archway that leads deeper into the dollhouse."
