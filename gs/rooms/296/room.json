      "The quiet of the moonlit street is broken by the sound of metal bouncing against metal.  A small group of rough-looking citizens gather in the shadow of the buildings, apparently busy at some gambling game.  From one small storefront comes the sound of a lilting melody being picked out on a lute.",
      "The clamor of the traffic is punctuated by the sound of metal bouncing against metal.  A group of children play in the shadow of the buildings, pitching coppers against the wall of a shop.  From one small storefront comes the sound of a lilting melody being picked out on a lute."
