      "The tent is large and holds a musty, earthen smell in its partially discolored dark brown walls.  Huge wooden totems carved into the likenesses of fish-headed monsters form a half-circle in the center of the pavilion and a half-finished curtain of fish scales lies strewn over a long wooden workbench.  A few iron-bound cages are stacked in a corner of the room, each one currently empty."
