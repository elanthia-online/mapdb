      "Nestled between the circular room housing the Guild Office and the main building, the Music Library is a nondescript room with one small window set high on its southern wall.  Every inch of remaining wall space is claimed by floor-to-ceiling shelves crafted of teak and polished to a high luster.  The shelves are packed with reams of parchment, all apparently covered with the tight scrawl of musical notation."
