      "A large well rests in the middle of this cobblestone square, a raised thatched roof sitting lopsidedly atop it.  Grasses and flowers poke up through the cobbles around the well, a few butterflies flitting lazily around them.  A few small trees have been planted on two sides of the square, long meadow grasses rising up around them.",

Lanterns hang from poles circle the square, providing enough light to make it quite bright here.  A few small trees have been planted on two sides of the square, long meadow grasses rising up around them."
