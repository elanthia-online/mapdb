      "The scent of fresh baked bread and the odor of the cooking fire somehow still linger in the air of this modest kitchen.  A large stone worktable occupies the center of the room, ringed with an array of cooking utensils that hang from hooks over the table.  The fireplace on the east wall is a gaping hole of brick, blackened with ages of soot and ash."
