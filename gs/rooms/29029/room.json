      "Shadows mark the edges of a deciduous forest that dominates the northern edges of a hard-packed dirt road as it curves around several standing stones.  Stratigraphic sections of limestone slowly rise to dominance in the west, while loose shale and tumbled gravel spread across the nearby grassy expanse.  A thickening band of moss splashes bright green along the tops of some of the larger outcroppings."
