      "A wooden gate framed by a high wall covered with ivy encloses the small, sunlit courtyard on all sides.  The ivy's dark green leaves create a dense cover that blocks out almost all of the noise from Wehnimer's busy streets.  Flagstones are set into a path passing under a lattice arch, which offers an avenue out of the picturesque enclosure.",
