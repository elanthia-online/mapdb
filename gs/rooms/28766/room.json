      "Tiny mosaic tiles in hues ranging from frosty blue to deep forest green cover the low stone pillars that border the porch of the resort.  Though expansive and quite exposed to the elements, the porch is kept meticulously free of snow and ice build-up, allowing guests to safely walk among the many ice sculptures displayed here.  A pair of massive polished haon doors with faenor handles allows entry to the building."
