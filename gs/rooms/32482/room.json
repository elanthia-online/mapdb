      "The fires of the kitchen hearths burn bright, filling the air with stifling warmth.  Roasting on spits are haunches and limbs of unidentifiable origin that give off a rich, savory scent.  Meticulously kept, counters of grey marble hold racks of fresh spices, cutting boards, and a wide variety of cooking utensils ranging from knives to copper pots.  A swinging door in the western wall leads to an extravagant dining chamber."
