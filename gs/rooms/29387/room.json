      "A blanket of warmth swaddles the dimly lantern-lit shop, emanating from braziers spaced across the smooth sandstone floor.  Oil lanterns and candles are concentrated to showcase an invar-pegged display and granite stand to the right of the entrance and a large metal rack to the left.  The occasional drip of falling water and subsequent sizzle of steam echo from the unlit periphery."
