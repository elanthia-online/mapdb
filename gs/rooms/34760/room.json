    "description": [
      "Framed by arched walls filled with friezes depicting sacrificial rites and scenes of carnage, the stretch of hallway is broken by a black stone fountain atop a series of circular steps.  The spigot, fashioned of mauve eahnor in the shape of a two-headed serpent, spits a constant flow of thick carmine fluid into the bowl below.  Candlelight, stained startling crimson, flickers through a black bloodwood door in the northern wall."
