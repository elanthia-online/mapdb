      "Low ceilings and cramped aisle give the space a disorderly feeling, which is only enhanced by the improper lighting and the heavy scent of rot and mildew that lingers in the damp, musty air.  Bookcases and cabinet stretch towards the ceiling, their tops brushing against the dark beams, and enclosing each aisle with the clutter of the bric-a-brac stored on their shelves.  From somewhere at the back of the shop, the incessant sound of something dripping can be heard."
