      "Hanging swathes of pale grey gauze cordon off the alcove from the rest of the shop's spacious interior.  Backlit by glowing candles, the cloth shimmers with hints of strange color and hue.  A sculpted bronze brazier in the shape of a winged boar casts the cloying scent of burning herbs into the perfumed air."
