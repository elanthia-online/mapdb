      "A wisp lantern-dotted perimeter rings a dance floor of glossy brown birch and white oak parquet panels, while a group of musicians sit tucked beneath an overhang of sugar maple tree branches laced with glowing lanterns.  The remainder of the leaf-carpeted edging is strewn with small, three-legged tables encircled by tightly bound, square hay bales draped in bronze and crimson checkered fabric.  Amidst the tables is a tiered wooden drink stand adorned with miniature gourds."
