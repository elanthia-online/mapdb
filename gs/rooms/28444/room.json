      "This room is a stark departure from the dark stone that comprises the rest of the keep.  The walls in this area are wooden, smoothly crafted and uniformly painted a neutral eggshell hue.  A small alcove sits to one side, containing a pedestal with an open book on it.  The light sound of a stringed instrument drifts through the area, though its source can't be seen.  Underfoot is a plush carpet tastefully coordinated with the color of the walls.",
      "The once eggshell-colored walls of the room have been garishly covered by murals of various artistic skill, the thick globs of paint and remains of ripe fruit adding texture to the once smooth surface.  Stuffed into the alcove are haphazard piles of broken armor and weaponry forged into a makeshift throne, the seat covered in layers of downy-stuffed cushions that spill onto the rugs and floorboards.  A split mahogany harp dominates the center of the room, its strings cross-tied then nailed to the instrument."
