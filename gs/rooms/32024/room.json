      "A tiered marble fountain sits cradled between skeletal hedges, the cracked structure filled with murky black waters dotted with decaying plant matter.  The feminine form of the adorning statue has been shattered into asymmetric pieces, the laurel-adorned head resting amongst the sea of weeds before the empty chateau set behind the decorations."
