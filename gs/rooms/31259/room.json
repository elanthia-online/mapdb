      "The austere appearance of this corridor lends to the rigid atmosphere of the entire asylum.  The hallway is mostly empty except for the occasional stone-faced guard that passes through on watch.  A few benches have been firmly secured to the floor along the perimeter.  Some massive double doors lead to a shared sleeping quarter for the inmates."
