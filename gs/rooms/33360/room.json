      "The smell of flour still hangs in the air, mixed slightly with the savory aroma of baked bread.  Wine racks occupy the wall directly above a blackened stove, and the center of the room is crowded by a heavy oak table generously stained by grease.  A small metal churn sits upon a rhimar-inset counter tucked away in one of the corners."
