      "Lotus-shaped votives float across the vivid waters of the terraced marble fountain, the fixture attached to an ecru limestone building draped in crystalline droplets across the windows.  The sounds of string instruments pour out from the shuttered windows above the shop, the occupants' balcony decorated in blown glass wind chimes gently ringing with the ambient coastal breeze.  A sculpture of repurposed driftwood stands nestled in the cypress-shaded corner, variegated mushrooms peeking out from beneath the asymmetric lengths."
