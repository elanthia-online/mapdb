      "An ebony door studded with golden rivets opens onto a precisely ordered chamber.  Brass-bound ledgers are stacked atop a mahogany table, joined by polished scales and stacks of silver coins.  Canvas sacks and labeled crates line the far bulkhead beneath racks that hold well-secured inkpots and parchments.  The compartment smells strongly of parchment and sharp preservatives."
