      "The faint lull of a melody drifts in from the tavern proper, and the small glaesine orbs strung beneath the canopy sway in time, set in motion by subtle sea breezes.  From the planter anchoring the canopy's support pole, clusters of coralbell splay upward, interspersed with delicate stalks of purple agapanthus.  Set near the carved stone railing of the mezzanine are a pair of granite benches."
