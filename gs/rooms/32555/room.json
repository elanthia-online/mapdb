      "Standing guard over squared niches in the walls, the tall bronze statue of a bearded old man raises his rod over the passageway.  Behind him, the wall is etched with an ornate gate with flourishes like wings spreading from it to either side.  One niche near the mural once held bones, but they have mostly collapsed into chalky grit."
