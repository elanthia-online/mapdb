      "Dark pine green silk descends from strong mistwood framework, enclosing the space in its dark, cooling shades.  Detailed butterflies are carved about the supports, creating a fanciful design.  Woven mats of pale water reeds cushion the ground, while a trio of brushed steel lanterns is suspended from the apex, covering the room with a pale radiance."
