      "A floor of uneven planks tracked with river mud greets the eye of the visitor.  A waterstained bench rests against one wall and above it sits a portrait surrounded by a gilded frame.  In the corner sit several crates, the uppermost stained with a pattern of splattered dark crimson spots and decorated with a vase of gathered cattails and bright yellow marsh marigolds.  In an opposite corner rests a half-open sack of letters and scrolls.  The planks of the wall nearest to the door are covered in numerous carvings."
