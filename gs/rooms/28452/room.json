      "This room is far longer than it is wide and is completely dominated by an impressively long banquet table.  Ornate candelabras are aligned perfectly down the center of the table, and beautifully carved mahogany benches with dark red cushioned seats are positioned along both its sides in perfect symmetry.",
      "A junk-covered banquet table completely dominates the room, the piles of gadgets and miscellaneous armor leading towards the steel candelabra overloaded with colorful glass spheres.  Mahogany benches are pinned against the chalked walls, draped with faded banners of silk and brocade covered in dust.  A string quartet stationed in an unobtrusive corner blends in save for the garishly bright cravats adorning their stone necks."
