      "Old pines tower to either side of the flagstone walk beyond a pale holly gate, the trees sheltering banks of driven snow beneath their verdant boughs.  Garlands festoon the branches of the evergreens, woven together from beautiful flowers foreign to such an unforgiving clime.  A manse with a gabled roof rules over the expansive estate, and welcoming candlelight flickers in its mullioned windows.  The front doors are of burled pine and are carved with prancing mules in relief."
