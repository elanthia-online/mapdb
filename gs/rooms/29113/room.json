    "description": [
      "The pale grey walls give the impression of closing in as this portion of the tunnel narrows to form a tightly confined space.  Passage is made more difficult by the presence of fallen rocks, obliterating what once may have been an accessible path.  A tremendous heat generating from the floor and walls makes them almost too hot to touch.  A reddish glow emanates from the edges of a nearby fissure."
