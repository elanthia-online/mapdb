      "The wall of this passageway is taken up by a frieze of four immense bulls.  Three are in file with the fourth facing them, its huge horns extended across the empty space.  All along the remaining walls, there are seemingly random arrangements of smaller animals of assorted shapes and sizes.  More of the curious crystalline deposits in the walls and ceiling emit diffused warmth and lighting throughout the passageway."
