      "A massive stone monolith peeks above a dense fog bank on the western shore, the rock topped with an empty nest like a small, shabby hat.  The turbid river bubbles here and there as it winds away gently to the southwest.  Hazy shapes along the eastern bank resemble a veritable army of treekin druids, the thickening patches of fog serving as their beards."
