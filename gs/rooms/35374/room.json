      "Steps wind upward, growing narrower as they ascend past jagged rock faces.  A flat expanse on the western wing supports a cafe, positioned directly across the mineral springs and pools that define the travertine terraces.  From the eastern side, a dramatic travertine arch is carved into the flanking wing and curves outward, creating a grand canopy that shelters the small establishment."
