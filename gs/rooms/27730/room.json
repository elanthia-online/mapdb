      "A few scattered alum pebbles lie in a heap in the corner, their unusual roundness and shine hinting at their use to pass the guards' slow nights away.  Shallow steps whose surfaces are marred by many muddy bootprints ascend toward the top of the tower, the entrance guarded by an iron-barred gate."
