      "Heavy crates fill every corner of the building, some opened to reveal a range of goods from weapons to dried meats and bolts of tartan.  A low wooden counter extends from near the doorway, with several small wooden rolton carvings spread out along its surface.  Light gleams in from a nearby window."
