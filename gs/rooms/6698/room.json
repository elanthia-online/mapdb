      "This part of the caves seems to be mostly untouched.  A fine mist blankets the floor of this cavern.  Stalactites and stalagmites have grown from the ceiling and floor blocking your path in places.  Minerals create a glimmering effect on the natural formations of rock.  The dim illumination from the cave lichen creates an unsettling sense of quiet here.  You feel a sense of holiness and sanctuary here.  The cave leads northwest and east out of the place of wonder."
