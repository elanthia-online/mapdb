    "description": [
      "Two crudely shaped pillars of ochre crystal flank the zenith of a porous stone ramp that descends into the depths of the grotto.  Light throbs within the towering formations, its rhythm too regular to be completely random.  At the bottom of the ramp spreads a sweeping edifice of the same unusual material, its twisting spires and strange geometries alien and offensively unnatural.  Moisture in the air beads along the descent, droplets of water trickling inexorably downward into the depths of the earth."
