      "Jewel-toned tapestries on the walls and woven rush mats on the floor keep the stone chamber's cold at bay and hold in the heat of the fireplace that takes up most of the spacious room's west wall.  On the eastern wall, mullioned windows with ornamental stained glass rosettes open onto a commanding view of the castle's grounds.  A massive four-poster bed heaped with bolster pillows and furs holds pride of place in the center of the vaulted bedchamber.",
      "Jewel-toned tapestries are covered with paper-cut hearts, and rush mats are sprinkled with similar confetti.  The stone chamber is heated by a wax-drizzled fireplace located by the room's west wall.  Along the east, mullioned windows with ornamental stained glass rosettes open onto a commanding view of the castle's grounds, partially obscured by the addition of more anatomical paper hearts.  A massive four-poster bed heaped with thick furs is centered in the vaulted bedchamber, the surface sprinkled with bright red rose petals."
