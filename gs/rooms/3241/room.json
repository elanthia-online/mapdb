      "The valley is covered with snow and there seems to be no sign of life in this harsh environment.  A cold blast of wind blows through, sending a cold chill up your spine making your teeth chatter.  The skeleton of an oak tree stands at the bottom of the small hill, the only indication that life was ever possible here."
