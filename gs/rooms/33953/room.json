      "Cracked pale cobbled slabs of stone and packed dirt stretch up and curve at their peak to create a domed ceiling.  Dried vines creep across the walls, weaving in and out from openings that are either man-made or timeworn, invading the spaces.  Sickly green orbs of light cast shades of color between black and vivid absinthe green across the area.  Shadows form stick-like fingers that grasp at the engraved sarcophagus dominating this cave."
