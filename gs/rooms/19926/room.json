      "The smell of fish and dampness of salt spray are strong on the sandstone quay.  It extends as a stony finger beyond the shoals offshore to where the wind's rush and sea's cacophony dominate the shrieks of gulls.  Light heaving lines lay tightly coiled on its starboard decking with a large fishing net strewn haphazardly alongside.  A watch fire smolders to seaward with its hint of light a guide to ships offshore.  Bollocks to port secure the heavy hawsers of a dragonship."
