      "Starlight paints the Spine of Koar in silver light, the great staircase a shadowy backdrop to the red marl and travertine avenue.  Surrounded in long, sword-shaped leaves, star-shaped ixia rise along the undeveloped landscape to the northwest amid tightly furled, purple-tipped oxalis.  Opposite, a bright blue boutique with a white shutter door stands open to visitors, lamplight spilling from its windows."
