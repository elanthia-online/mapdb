      "In the shadow of the inner stone wall, the center square spreads out along smoothed granite footing and is occupied by several squat stone buildings.  The rock structures have no visible entrance and hold several slits within their walls.  A crown of rugged mountain ranges stretches in the distance as the sky peeks in overhead."
