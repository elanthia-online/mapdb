      "Higher than even the tallest giant, the cavern ceiling opens up to the sky to reveal dark grey stormclouds looming overhead against a nighttime sky.  Rain flows freely down the granite walls and fills up small depressions scattered about, exacerbating the humid quality of this place.  The muffled roar of a neighboring waterfall adds a natural harmony to the sounds of an approaching storm, but extended periods of such auditory stimulation can be deafening."
