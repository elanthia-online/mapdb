      "Glass doors across the far wall have been folded back, opening the room to the garden beyond.  Thick, rustic wooden beams along the ceiling contrast the white walls and woven rugs strewn across the stone floor.  Surrounded by chairs, a white pine table dominates the room beneath a trio of wicker lanterns.  Tucked in the corner, a pot-bellied stove sits besides an ornate andiron well-stocked with firewood.  Reclaimed wood shelves line opposing walls, interspersed with artwork in varied styles and mediums."
