      "The grotto is humid and foggy from intermittent bursts of steam that erupt from small cratered geysers scattered throughout the chamber.  A solid rocky platform on one side provides safe passage and a repose to bathe in the sultry atmosphere.  Several curtained recesses among the geysers act as saunas, providing a place for quiet meditation and intense, soothing heat."
