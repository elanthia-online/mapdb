      "Table and chair legs are scattered across the cobblestones of the floor and mingle with torn seat covers and shattered glass.  Blankets of dust and spider's webs attempt to hide the destroyed pieces but only add to the general gloom of the area.  Thick scratches upon the walls mingle with ribbons of color, while tiny chips of paint decorate the floor."
