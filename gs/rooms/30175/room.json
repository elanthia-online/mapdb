      "Luxuriously appointed with plush carpets over a polished teak floor, the cabin is well lit by gilded brass sconces set with beeswax candles.  The curtains are drawn back from an expansive, glaes-paned window, allowing the sunlight to spill across a shadowy black cedar bed layered with plush furs and onto an obsidian ironwood table and a mahogany settee cushioned with plush velvet nearby.  A vanilla-hued papyrus map is stuck to an ironwood-paneled wall by a dagger driven in almost to the hilt."
