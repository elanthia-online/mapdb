      "Flames of the forest trees bow over the sloping path, appearing ablaze from the clusters of brilliant scarlet flowers wrapping their sprawling limbs.  Below the fiery canopy, gnarled roots crawl out from eroded banks, fusing into contorted, natural steps caught between the crumbling faces of earth as they descend to the south.  Mosses creep across the organic stairs like a thin, verdant carpet."
