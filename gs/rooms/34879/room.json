      "Muddy footprints leave damp tracks in the otherwise dry and dusty ground beneath the forest cottage home.  A large wax-covered worktable is centered in the space, the scuffed earth around it marking where chandlers, both masters and apprentices alike, have gathered to practice their craft.  A metal bucket bearing an abundance of opaque wax cubes teeters precariously on the top shelf of a nearby display rack offering a selection of colorful vials."
