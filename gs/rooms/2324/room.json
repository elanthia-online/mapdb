      "The air within the cave is very still, as if the glacier is holding its frosty breath.  Icicles dip from the ceiling, refracting the radiance of the sun from outside into kaleidoscopic patterns that suffuse the walls with rainbowed light.  The cave seems far from the bustle of town, offering a pristine spot to sit a moment and ponder.",
      "The air within the cave is very still, almost as if the glacier is holding its breath.  Icicles drip from the walls, refracting the sunlight from outside into tiny rainbows.  Your thoughts grow deeper, making you wish to sit a moment and simply ponder."
