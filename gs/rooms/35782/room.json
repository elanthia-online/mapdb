    "description": [
      "Harbored within silver-kissed sea holly and tall, blue-green seagrass, a tiny bungalow fashioned of white-washed grey driftwood glows in the moonlight.  Sanded planks of pine, illuminated by copper-shielded candles, traverse the distance between the beach and front door, while yellow-eyed fleabane and tangles of delicate sea lavender blossom surround the support posts.  A thin stream dips beneath the wooden walkway, its salty water feeding into a tidal pool with rhythmic abandon.  Disappearing in the bungalow's shadows is a pearly white shell-lined pathway."
