      "Soot-hued walls ring the small alcove, lit only by a single iron oil lamp mounted near the ceiling, the illumination washing across the white marble inlaid overhead.  As the flickering light shifts and scatters, finely detailed illustrations etched in the blackened surface almost seem to dance as they encircle the room."
