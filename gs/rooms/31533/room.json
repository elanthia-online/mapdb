      "The ceiling in this room is pitched at a high angle, with the exposed rafters forming the barest framework of a conventional space.  Nestled amongst the shadowy eaves are a series of chandeliers, each one providing enough ambient light by which to see, but not enough to completely dispel the dimness.  The hardwood floors have been polished to a glossy finish, and a massive overstuffed leather chair sits in front of a stacked stone fireplace."
