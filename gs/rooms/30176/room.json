      "Accessible via a sea blue ironwood gangplank, the main deck is outfitted with some cannons on either side.  Ratlines ascend upwards to the crows nest attached to a wooden mast, a pennant fluttering above a storm grey flyrsilk sail.  An opening in the wide-planked deck leads to the cargo hold below, the faint aroma of mildew and livestock mingling with the sea breeze near the hatch."
