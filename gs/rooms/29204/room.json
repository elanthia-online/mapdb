      "Sharp rocks, loose pebbles, and deep, dry sand all conspire to make this a difficult climb.  Beach grasses have made incursions into the footpaths here, but the line of travel is still visible underfoot.  The view to the east is breathtaking, with a series of piers jutting out into the water, and a vast expanse of ocean stretching to the horizon."
