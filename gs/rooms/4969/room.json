      "A sun-bleached skull lies partially buried at the jagged opening of the cavern entrance with what appears to be a baby cave worm slithering in and out of the empty eye sockets.  The rest of the skeletal remains are nowhere to be seen.  A circle of rocks encases charred pieces of wood and ashes, apparently the surviving traces of an old campfire.  Tattered and torn clothing hangs from two tree branches that have been buried deeply in the dirt."
