      "Several small caverns lead off from this landing.  There is a slope running up towards the surface and continuing down into the depths.  Rusted iron rails gleam dully in the gloom.  A broken ore cart sits to one side where it was apparently abandoned long ago.  Smashed chunks of ore and rusted iron litter the floor and there is a tang of metal in the air."
