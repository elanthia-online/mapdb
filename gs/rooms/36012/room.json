      "Smooth stones scatter across the shoreline, their rounded surfaces shifting slightly where waves brush against them.  Along the western water's edge, a row of globleflower shrubs forms a low barrier, their bright yellow blooms rising above dense green foliage.  A walnut and ironwood bench rests beside the winding track, and several bowls sit within easy reach.  In the shallows, lake sedge and cattails nod in the breeze, while far to the west, the lake breaks into small distributaries that slip into the taller grasses as they fade from view."
