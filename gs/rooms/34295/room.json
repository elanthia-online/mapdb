      "Generous rains provide an abundance of nourishment for the local flora and a grand home of silver maples.  Despite their girth, they sway with disciplined rhythm as if repeating learned behavior after years of stormy weather.  High along the western ridge, flashes of vivid sapphire produce a luminous aura that fades quickly, making it difficult to pinpoint its exact location.  In an effort to sneak past intruders, a small creature scurries across the ground and darts beneath a pile of broken branches."
