      "Pale blue-on-ivory brocade covers the interior of the shop, the floriated lengths bound with long, silken tassels of silver and gold.  Iron-wrought racks frame either side of a mirror-finished counter, the leaf-shaped shelving filled with a variety of glass bottles and jars of colorful pigment.  Set along the curved beams of the wagon are a scatter of diminutive bee-shaped lanterns, the polished vessels each inset with a droplet of greenish gold arathiel faintly illuminating the ceiling."
