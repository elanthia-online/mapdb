      "Overlooking a dirt racing track, multi-tier plank benches painted bright crimson are packed into an oak constructed stand raised above ground level.  Silken ebon banners are draped at all corners, while crimson streamers featuring various wolf silhouettes flutter from sturdy wooden railings.  The smell of roasting peanuts and freshly popped corn wafts through the seating area."
