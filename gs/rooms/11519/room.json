      "An ancient, rusting sconce holds the crumbling remains of a torch on the dark stone wall.  Blackened streaks mar the wall above the sconce, stretching to the ceiling of the passage.  A door hangs loosely in the entrance to a cell to the southeast, the iron spikes in the hinges reluctantly releasing their grip on the rotting wood."
