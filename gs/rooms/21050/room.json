    "description": [
      "Barren by most jungle standards, the area has a charred and dead feel to it.  Tree trunks show their trial by fire with alligator-scale burn patterns running up their length.  Singed flowers and ash mix in the dark soil as the jungle begins to heal itself once more.  Hot, humid air barely circulates, and the oppressive atmosphere is heightened by the lack of jungle sounds.  Small glimpses of new life poke their way out of the ashen soil, a testament to the hardiness of the region."
