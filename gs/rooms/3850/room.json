      "A simple maoral desk sits upon a leaf-patterned carpet in the middle of the room, a pair of comfy looking chairs in front of it.  An exchange board bordered with paneled white curtains covers nearly the whole wall behind the desk.  A wooden bookshelf filled with various books and scrolls takes up another wall, while a regal mahogany curio filled with manifests fills a third.",
