      "Molds of varied luminescent hues grow in large clumps and patches, consuming the majority of the dock underfoot.  A slow marshland stream is clogged with large rocks and fallen, petrified trees that have uprooted on the opposite side.  One of the trees is mostly intact, bridging a gap between two sections of the moldy fishing dock.  The stream carves its way through the colorful growths that have overtaken the area, zigzagging towards a larger body of water to the northeast."
