      "Extraordinarily capacious, the wagon's interior has high sides inlaid with sheets of dream, panther, and beetle agates.  The floor is highly polished fel, and an elaborately embroidered curtain sections off a small area towards the front.  A male erithian mannequin and a female erithian mannequin stand on either side of a dawn agate counter."
