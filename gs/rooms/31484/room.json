      "Thick planks of oak create a walkway that parallels the ocean.  Floating tigerwood docks are secured to the east along the shoreline.  Wandering off to the west, a narrow trail disappears into the forest.  Laughter flows out of an iron and mahogany building built across the path, away from the water.  A small stone shop is tucked between a pair of spindly trees with warped bark that has been damaged by the sea air."
