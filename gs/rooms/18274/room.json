      "Thickets of shrubs, ancient trees, and clinging liana vines accentuate the untamed jungle.  Amongst the shadows, gnarled tree roots descending into the soil resemble crippled fingers clawing fiercely at the dirt as they tangle over each other in a struggle for space with the plants.  The faint sounds of nocturnal creatures break the oppressive silence of night, and shafts of moonlight cast subtle illumination as they reflect from the surface of rainwater collected within dead tree limbs.",
      "Thickets of shrubs, ancient trees, and clinging liana vines accentuate the untamed wilderness.  Large, gnarled roots descend into the rich, leaf-covered soil from each of the tree trunks, their lengths protruding here and there as they tangle over each other in a fierce struggle for space amongst the overgrowth of plant-life.  Small depressions in the remains of long-dead tree limbs collect rainwater for the multitude of insects drawn to the humid environment."
