      "Scores of candles rest atop long oaken tables, filling the room with light despite the hour, and weary-looking scholars mutter quietly to themselves as they sit entranced by the historical tomes they peruse.  High on the far wall, an enormous wrought iron and stained glass window glows with the moonlight pouring through it."
