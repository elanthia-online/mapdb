    "description": [
      "Amidships, the Mageborn is cracked open, what remains of its aft sagging, defeated, into the waves.  Pools of seawater collect in depressions along the warped deck, reflecting scavenging seabirds as they soar across the sky.  Rusted equipment and cargo debris lie scattered across the broken deck, the latter comprising waterlogged footlockers, crates still tied down to rusting hooks, and a few barrels of wine long since gone sour."
