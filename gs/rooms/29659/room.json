      "Opaque panels of luxurious, sorrel-hued suede enshroud the pavilion, save for a folded curtain that allows in a substantial amount of outdoor light and an errant breeze.  Several upturned metallic horseshoes line the upper ridge of some lacquered mahogany shelves that are bedecked with an elaborate display of finely crafted footwear.  The rich, heady scent of leather goods pervades the well-kept shop, the fragrance strongest near a polished walnut countertop."
