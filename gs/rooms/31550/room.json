      "Built in an outside area of the academy, the arena is surrounded by a wall of clear energy that rises into the air, joining at a central focal point and creating a shimmering dome.  Several passageways can be seen behind the magical barrier.  The ground of the area is covered in multi-hued cobblestones.  There are no adornments or obstacles that can be seen except random areas that are blackened or discolored."
