      "Displayed over the doorway of small cottage is a stuffed stag's head, complete with a magnificent set of ten-tined antlers.  Cleaned furs and pelts line the wooden walls, trophies of many an adventurer's victorious hunt.  A tidy rack filled with sharp tools is set on the wall behind a wide counter."
