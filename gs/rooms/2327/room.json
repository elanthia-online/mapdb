      "Several large bushes grow against the walls of a small low-roofed shrine, their snow-covered forms displaying delicate icy blue rose blossoms.  The structure appears to be nearly frozen, its soft dappled pink and white walls visible underneath a glistening coat of thin ice.  Rounded doors of the same speckled hue lead into the small building, their surfaces engraved with whimsical designs.",
