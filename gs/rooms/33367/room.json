      "Rows of roughly hewn wooden slabs are pushed to the side of the square-shaped room, each one with its own set of wickedly sharp tools exhibited on hanging steel hooks behind it.  Ledges teeming with a multitude of supplies and other labeled toolboxes wrap around the upper half of the walls.  Prepped for longer periods of work, an aged vultite-chased lantern hovers above an elaborate fir sideboard.  Scads of untanned hides are stacked next to a fauna-carved rowan arch, opposite another meticulously sorted selection of variegated pelts."
