      "The dirt floor slopes sharply downward and less light filters in through the arch of wire mesh above.  This westernmost tentacle of the hutch, by design or mishap, seems to be burrowing its way into the soft soil.  Muffled by earthen walls, the everpresent scrabbling recedes a bit, but from the dimness ahead comes an odd new sound...softer and somehow more unsettling."
