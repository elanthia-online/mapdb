      "Standing sneering atop a parapet, the weathered bronze statue of a powerfully built krolvin holds a smaller squirming figure aloft.  Victory is written across his cruel features.  Untended, the figure has developed a patina of verdigris, but it is also spattered in the droppings of seabirds, which have left a goopy white shawl about his shoulders.  The nearby homes are small and dark, and there is little foot traffic along the thoroughfare."
