      "The disrepair of the walls is mostly hidden behind an array of large squares of parchment pinned in place by silver tacks.  Everything from architecture to clothing designs are accounted for, with the latter being mostly centered over the makeshift worktable at the rear of the room, where samples of cloth -- damask, satin, and jacquard -- litter the top.  An adjustable dress form stands bare in one corner, while a square pedestal table stands beside it."
