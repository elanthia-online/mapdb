    "description": [
      "Cobwebs span every corner betwixt the walls and ceiling, some so laden with dust that they sag like worn out party banners, while others are still occupied by their creators and their mumified and cocooned prey.  The hearth is cold, but full of ashes, its outer masonry stained with soot, and a broken wooden chair lies discarded before it.  A single threadbare rug and one small table are the cottage's only other furnishings."
