    "description": [
      "What once was a quaint chapel has been burnt and desecrated, leaving behind only scorched skeletal remains.  Above, the missing roof offers a clear view of the eerie auroras dancing against the black sky, with only the charred remains of the chapel's steeple marring the scenery.  Hanging across the walls on some jagged nails appears to an assortment of weapons.  Ripples of dark energy writhe across the dilapidated walls and flooring and across the remains of some blackened pews and a charred stone altar inlaid with black ora runes."
