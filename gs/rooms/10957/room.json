      "Like any good inn, this one has a meeting hall, well suited to large gatherings.  This hall serves as a gathering spot for those interested in relaxing in the company of good friends.  There is an oaken doorway leading to a dining area featuring several tables with high-backed chairs and off to one side you notice a small door that just might lead to a kitchen, judging from the wonderful smells that seem to come from that direction.  At the far end of the room, a small stage rises above the main floor."
