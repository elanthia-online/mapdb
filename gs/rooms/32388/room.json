    "description": [
      "Though the surrounding palisade wall does little to mute the cries of gulls or the whistling of the western wind, the holdfast swathed in eerie silence.  Not a child's cry stirs the air, and the surrounding huts, with their pine-and-tar construction and rooftops thatched with tundra grass, have a hollowness to them that betrays a lack of habitation.  Near the gate that is the sole means of egress from the hold, a net full of skeletal fish lies forgotten."
