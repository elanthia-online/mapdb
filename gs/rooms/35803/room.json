      "The domed ceiling of the room has been painted with an expansive map of Elanthia, the cities inlaid with burnished eahnor, while the bodies of water reflect their shards of vivid sapphire.  A circular bed of lacquered mahogany lays beneath the cartographic design, illuminated by a pierced golden lantern casting scattered patterns of light across the wood-planked floor.  Haphazard piles of books lay stacked upon leather-bound trunks nestled to either side of a carved stone staircase."
