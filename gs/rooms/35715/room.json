    "description": [
      "Sheer stone walls of rock as black as dried blood rise to either side of the gorge, their weathered surfaces streaked with stark veins of turquoise stone around a tall, narrow cave mouth.  Sparse clusters of grass cling with determination to crevices around the opening.  The floor of the valley is littered with bits of old bone, made brittle and yellow by long exposure to the elements.  Breezes sing through the passage, soliciting resonant harmonies from hollows in the rock as they gust past."
