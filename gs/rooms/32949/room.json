      "Smooth granite walls encompass this generous octagonal room, the ceiling and floor meeting at expertly chiseled corners.  A wide ramp carved from the surrounding rock winds down from above, terminating at the solid granite floor.  Blazing torches set betwixt stone arches standing on each wall provide ample light and passage for the bustling traffic that moves between them.  Some serious looking dwarves stand guard, their keen eyes scanning for foolhardy thieves in the throng."
