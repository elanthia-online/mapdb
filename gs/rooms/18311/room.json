      "Choked by the broken pieces of floating grass meadows pushed downstream, the murky river narrows considerably and begins a gradual path to the southeast.  Moonlight glistens off of the river as it ripples with the current, providing brief illumination through the hazy mist permeating the air.  The shadowy forms of grass flowers, their spindly stems twisting and turning in the slight evening breeze, flutter about the area as they are carried downstream.",
