      "Situated precisely at the center of the platform, a spacious structure of pristine stonework serves as the primary focal point for the area.  Guarding the structure's entrance are two humanoid stone statues, each brandishing an imposing naginata.  The stones centered between the statues are stained a deep crimson, creating a perfect triangle.",
      "A larger stone hovel presides over a raised platform.  Guarding the entrance of the hovel are two stone statues, each brandishing a tall naginata.  The stones in the center are stained a dark red, creating a triangle on the floor."
