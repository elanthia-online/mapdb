      "Flowing swiftly from east to west with a down-sloped southern curve, a wide stream bisects the ground and separates the more inaccessible and treacherous section along the south edge from the traversible north side.  At the bottom of the southerly slope, following the flow of the river, is a shimmering lake, visible from various points in this region, but its full beauty only realized when within this close proximity."
