      "Sagging under the weight of heavy coats, juniper racks crowd the felt-and-lattice ger until only precariously narrow paths remain to wind through the chaos.  On scattered tables, rough-hewn birch heads model plush hats, their blank faces half-hidden beneath shaggy fur and fluffy earflaps.  A metal wood-burning stove in the center, set dangerously close to fuzzy hides, warms the space with a stifling heat."
