      "Glass counters line the eastern and western walls, boasting a wide variety of rings and bands.  A talented jeweler bustles around behind the counters, stopping occasionally to peruse an order book.  Bright sunlight pours through clear glass panels in the ceiling, creating a glimmering effect off the precious stones and metal.  Small tables, stacked with a multitude of ring boxes, stand to either side of the marble arch that leads back to the concourse."
