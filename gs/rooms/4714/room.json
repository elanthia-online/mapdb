      "Ferns receive dappled sunlight for short periods during the day.  Even under the thickest canopy, in the deepest shade, a surprising number of plants make up the undergrowth.  In places where the soil is poor, or the forest litter is especially thick, very few plants are growing.",

Even under the thickest canopy, moonlight filters through to shine on a surprising number of plants making up the undergrowth.
