    "description": [
      "The cold is intense and cruel, sharp enough to cut.  Carried on waves of violent wind, it sweeps low over the snowy flats, whipping the fresh snowfall in undulating waves.  All around is white and grey.  If bird or beast dwell in such an unforgiving clime, their cries are drowned out by the relentless shriek of the winds."
