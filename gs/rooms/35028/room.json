    "description": [
      "Air warps and shimmers over the wide body of a lava flow.  The deadly flood of molten rock surges sluggishly down the bed of a river that once occupied the plains.  All that remains of the lost body of water is its imprint on the earth.  Vegetation is sparse and brown, the life choked from it by the oppressive heat and the scalding gases that sweep across the tormented plain."
