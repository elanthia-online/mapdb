      "The king's stone locks have been blasted by centuries of wind, and the head that was once crowned and full is bald now except for a few rounded protrusions.  As you gaze out across the lands before you, you feel as though you too are an immortal ruler surveying your lands.  But the lands are barren and the wind buffets you with fits of mocking laughter.",

As you gaze up at the stars which fill the sky from horizon to horizon, you feel as though you too are an immortal ruler surveying your domain.  But the lands are barren and the chill night wind buffets you with fits of mocking laughter."
