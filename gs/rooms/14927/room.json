      "A series of boulders work to create steps to this small crown, the top of which is covered with lush moss, thriving heartily from the near constant moisture in the air.  Level with the last tier, the view of the clear pool below provides an excellent vantage to watch errant swimmers ducking in and out of the moonlight.",
      "A series of boulders work to create steps to this small crown, the top of which is covered with lush moss, thriving heartily from the near constant moisture in the air.  Level with the last tier, the view of the clear pool below provides an excellent vantage to watch errant swimmers.  Beyond the tops of the trees, the vast meadow stretches out like a green sea, broken only by the decorative arbors placed here and there for gatherings."
