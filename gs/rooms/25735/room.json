      "The flooring underfoot in this large open foyer is inlaid with hundreds of polished tiles in varying hues of golds, reds, and browns.  A life-sized image of a golden harp dominates the center scene, encircled by smaller depictions of lyres, flutes, and mandolins.  Linen draped tables flank the entry doors, and several upholstered wingback chairs provide seating for waiting guests."
