    "description": [
      "As you ascend a large dune, the moon's light casts an eerie pall across the sand.  Once you reach the top, a mesmerizing view unfolds before you.  The sand below gives way to an elevated grassy field stretching out into a dark forest, its dark greenery almost impenetrable.  A cold, salty breeze cuts through the thickest cloth.  In the distance, you hear leaves rustling as the wind exposes a faint path leading into the jungle's shadows."
