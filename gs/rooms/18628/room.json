      "Bubbly blue-tinted glass sits in large window panes, giving the room an oceanic feel.  Silken hangings in shades of blue and green wave in a slight breeze, keeping the room in constant motion.  Hanging from the ceiling are several shining bits of silver, laying out the sailors' guiding constellations with the moon Liabo in the center, guiding the way."
