      "Songbirds pattern the wallpaper near to the wooden table, their plumage coming in a variety of colors and styles.  The tabletop itself is carved with a preening pheasant with its tailfeathers spread in a vainglorious display.  A spray of brightly colored feathers rings a small lamp at the center."
