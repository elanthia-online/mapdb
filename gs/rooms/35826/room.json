      "Dozens of widowwood-framed mirrors cover the velvet-curtained walls of the shop, the geometric cuts of glass draped in garlands of dark-colored florals and twisted vinework spilling down towards the elongated counters.  Partially concealed by vellum-cut leaves and dried petals are carved ebony trays lined in obsidian silk, displaying the various wares amidst the haze of incense smoke permeating the room."
