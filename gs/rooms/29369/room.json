      "Black stripes have been painted upon the bright orange walls in a wavy pattern to elicit the appearance of a tiger's distinctive fur.  Cushions of bright, sunny yellow velvet add pops of color to otherwise simple wooden stands displaying this showroom's wares.  The heady fragrances of tuberose, chocolate, and amber drift in from every nook and cranny."
