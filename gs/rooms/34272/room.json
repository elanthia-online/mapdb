      "Alternating tiles of cobalt blue and alabaster stretch across the floor of the classroom, meeting the half-wall of white wainscotting that transitions to flat blue.  Various framed artwork are displayed about the room, their images depicting a variety of local flora and fauna, while the entire eastern wall beyond a glossy golden linden podium is covered in slate to create a blue-grey chalkboard.  A smattering of high stools surrounds long oak-planked tables, providing numerous seating options for those ready to learn."
