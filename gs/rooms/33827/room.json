      "The polished black walnut flooring is offset by the gold-framed torches, whose flicker sets a somber, quiet tone.  The walls are covered in simple gold and blue splattered paint, as if the room is either not finished or it is a failed attempt at a more artistic approach.  Along the walls are glaes shelves, lined in pearls, allowing a simply elegant display for the musical instruments they hold."
