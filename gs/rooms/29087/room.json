      "Boxy and open, the parapet widens into a three-walled shelter with openings that face the wilderness beyond.  A lone torch rests in the center, its fitfully burning flames present throughout the day and night.  Taking up a large amount of the floor space, a large ballista is strategically positioned in a way that allows it to be advantageously aligned."
