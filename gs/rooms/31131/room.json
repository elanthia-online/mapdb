      "Garret's room is a haven of peace and tranquility.  The walls and floor are soft shades of grey with here and there some furniture of dark polished mahogany.  A small fire burns in the hearth spreading a comforting warmth that drives away the damp chill of the Bay.  Hanging above a tidy desk is an ancient greatsword bearing an elaborate crest engraved upon the blade."
