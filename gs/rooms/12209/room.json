      "Worms practically cover the walls and floor.  The rhythmically collapsing walls shake some from the ceiling as well, dropping them around you to chew their way into the floor.  A disconcerting, whistling wheeze sounds throughout the area, as wind howls through the holes in the chamber.  Blood oozes over the floor northward."
