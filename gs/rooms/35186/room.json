      "A short step down reveals a dimly lit hallway, with the scent of aged leather and alchemical spices lingering in the air.  On either side, some wooden racks of armor stand as silent sentinels, their surfaces reflecting the soft glow of crystals embedded in the ceiling.  The hallway, lined with shelves holding faintly glowing crystal flasks, stretches ahead further into the shop."
