      "Wood made from repurposed ships' hulls lines the floors and walls of this small entryway, all polished to a rich sheen.  The variety of woods and hues is broken by an iron-worked rich maoral door leading back to the shop, and a spiral staircase winding up.  Hanging between a pair of crossed cutlasses is a brass plaque, and an unusually neat pile of netted glass floats is carefully arranged in one corner, each globe dimly lit from the inside to illuminate the area."
