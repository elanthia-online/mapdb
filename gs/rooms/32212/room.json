      "Sturdy branches of slate grey interweave in an arching lattice to form the living walls of the area, the leaf-adorned limbs highlighted by tiny motes of light.  Unraveling bolts of fabric float along the perimeter of the room, occasionally brushing past a trio of mannequins draped in bespoke gowns of swirling smoke.  Exceedingly tall bookshelves climb upwards toward the glass-domed ceiling, revealing a constellation-filled sky illuminating the watercolored panes."
