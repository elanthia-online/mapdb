    "description": [
      "Set within a hollowed section of a willow tree, the kitchen has a warm atmosphere permeated by the scent of food cooking.  A stone firepit is topped with a mantel of woven willow branches holding various sparkling pots and pans, and above a trio of stoves, a willow branch serves as a rack holding various utensils and teas.  In the center of the room is a massive polished table that appears to have grown from the floor.  Staff scurry back and forth under the watchful eyes of the head cook and the head baker, and some louvered swinging doors lead out."
