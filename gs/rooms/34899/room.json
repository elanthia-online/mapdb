      "Ferns of the fluffy variety as well as ferns of the fiddlehead type rise up sharply from the moist and humid earth.  From far above, large round spores fall to the ground, posing a serious risk to tiny passersby.  Sadly, a rotten gourd standing guard can do little to mitigate the aerial assault from the giant green fronds."
