      "Vibrant green grass provides a natural blanket that spreads from one end of the tent to the other, the long stalks tamped down in some areas due to foot traffic.  Various hanging shelves, tied to the rafters and anchored in the ground, house a variety of wares and are evenly spaced to prevent crowding.  Dormant lanterns, nothing more than glass jars with votives in them, capture the sunlight that spills into the entry and refract it to provide ample illumination.",
