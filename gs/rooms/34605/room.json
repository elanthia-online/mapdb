      "Resting against the far wall, a large wooden cupboard hangs open, its contents haphazardly shoved onto the shelves within.  A small steel dust bin stands behind a slender ironwood door, its contents overflowing onto the cool, dark floor.  Set back into a corner is a copper rack holding more guild supplies.  A faint smell of dampness permeates the air."
