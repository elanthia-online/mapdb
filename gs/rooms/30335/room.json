      "Narrowing perceptibly near the bow, the space beside the foremast is wide open and free of benches or barrels, leaving room for patches of snow and slush.  The dark-stained decking planks are meticulously reinforced for winter, the walls covered in wool and fur to prevent chill.  Short railings, solid save for a small window every few feet that allows sea and rain water to escape, are dotted with a series of some round shields with painted faces."
