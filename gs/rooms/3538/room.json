    "description": [
      "A limestone-clad structure stands back from the wey, its pale ivory walls delicately carved with symbols of the Arkati.  Narrow windows of stained glaes frame the building's wide double doors.  A small mithril plaque is mounted on the doorpost.",
      "Not much remains here but limestone dust and shards of crushed glass.  A few larger stones here and there indicate that a building once stood here, but nothing of any value or significance is left.",
      "A neat path leads from the wey to a cottage sitting in the shadow of the great wall, its appearance nearly festive in a city of austere marble and limestone.  The cottage has been painted the pale blue of the sea, and several window boxes are home to a variety of tropical plants and flowers.",
      "A neat path meanders from the wey through an open gate and leads toward a villa sitting in the shadow of the great wall.  Painted the pale blue of the sea, the building adds a splash of color to this city of austere marble and limestone.  The faint scent of flowers emanates through the fence that surrounds the property."
