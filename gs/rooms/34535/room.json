      "A tiny skylight has been cut into the wooden ceiling of the wagon, allowing light to filter through a series of copper-cut stars and crescent moons that cast their celestial shadows across the small room.  A large map of the stars is tacked to one cherrywood wall, while a short bookcase and a polished counter take up the rest of the available wall space.  Silk-draped cherrywood partitioning separates the wagon's interior into two sections, a copper-threaded curtain leading back to the main area."
