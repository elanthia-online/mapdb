      "Thin slats of linden and mahogany form the intricate walls of the shop, the latticework hung with a rack of lacquer-dipped antlers amidst a curtain of vivid dark green ivy.  The dense vines curl between the open gaps of each panel, tendrils gathering across a stone and pale marble display while lengths climb back up into the oak-planked ceiling."
