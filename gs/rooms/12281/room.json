      "A faded plum rug rests in the center of this room, glass cases holding various different kinds of lockpicks lining the walls around it.  Upon the carpet is an oak pedestal with a carving of a man kneeling and attempting to pick open a box.  Locks of all shapes and sizes hang upon the walls and a curved iron staircase leads upstairs.  The unadorned windows have been left open, allowing a fragrant breeze to waft through the area.",
