      "A skeleton lies near the doorway, its arm reaching out into the hallway behind.  Five more skeletons inhabit the room, each chained to the wall, some by their hands and others by their feet.  Several rib cages are stuffed with miscellaneous tufts of cloth, straw, and fur, creating homes for some of the dungeon's smaller furrier residents."
