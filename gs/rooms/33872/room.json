    "description": [
      "A curved wall of sun-bleached limestone frames the cliffside of the walkway, the elongated ledge decorated with ship-carved planters filled with eryngium and sea lavender.  Several fine-grained telescopes of brass stand upon carved stone pedestals, the instruments tilted down towards the naefira-framed ports below the square.  Diminutive anchor wheels serve as circular tables between the pedestals, each one covered in stacks of parchment, then weighted by gear-affixed orrery."
