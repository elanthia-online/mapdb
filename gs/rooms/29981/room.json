      "Towering feminine figures, carved and implacable, bend over the pathway from ornate pedestals, their wings spread wide as if they are about to descend upon intruders.  The floor transitions abruptly between untamed rock to stone that is smooth and even, if caked in dust and detritus.  From somewhere in the distance, the sound of water hitting stones plays a constant, tense drumbeat that echoes incessantly on the cold air."
