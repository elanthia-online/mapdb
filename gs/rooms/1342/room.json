      "Gazing northward, the trail climbs towards a gap between Tor Aganrahk and Tor Soranrahk, while stark against the southern sky a patterned silhouette of crenellations crowns an east-west ridge.  From here the caravan trail runs straight up the ridge and meets the battlements at a gap marked by the sharper outlines of new stonework."
