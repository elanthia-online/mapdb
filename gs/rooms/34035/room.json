    "description": [
      "The broken remains of the ancient white road travel up to the jagged rim of a steep gorge.  So deep is the gouge in the earth that its furthest reaches are lost in impenetrable shadow, and it would serve as an impassable hazard save for a colossal stone bridge spanning the chasm.  Though ancient, the carvings on the bridge are deep-graven, depicting preternaturally beautiful figures in a variety of scenes.  Beyond the bridge rises a mountain, its peak lost in the clouds overhead."
