      "Lofted ceilings are supported by exposed rafters, while long windows on the western and eastern walls are wide open to allow every bit of cooling air into the stifling stable.  Hay is stacked low to the ground, leaving room for the wide-bladed fans to spin from their secured place in the ceiling.  Turning slowly, the fans are attached to some kind of pulley system that disappears out one of the windows."
