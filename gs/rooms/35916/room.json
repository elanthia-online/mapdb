      "The remains of a building, little more than some inwardly collapsing walls and a rusted tin roof, are lofted just above the water's surface by dark pilings, and a broken and disused wooden water wheel lays off to the side amid the trees.  A millstone, half-buried in the soft soil at the pond's edge, betrays the building's forgotten purpose and diverts the slow trickle of a stream into the water."
