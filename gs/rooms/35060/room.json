      "At the center of the marketplace, the shattered remains of a statue stand atop a grey granite plinth.  Only the boots remain, the legs attached to them reduced to jagged stumps.  A parliament of stalls and tents have been erected at the base of the broken monument, opposite a wagon of golden oak with a series of steps leading up to its covered bed."
