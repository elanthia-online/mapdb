      "Walls glow with vivid coral in hues of crimson, gold, and cobalt, rising in layered outcrops that shape the bright cavern.  Plant life covers every surface, from broad fronds to fine tendrils, all shifting with the current's slow pull.  Fish move in quick bursts, slipping through narrow spaces and weaving between stalks.  The sandy floor spreads beneath, smooth and gently rippled, dotted with scattered shells and broken stone, forming the foundation of this colorful submerged expanse."
