      "This section of the crater rim has numerous obsidian peaks that flank the walkable path on either side.  Some of the shiny obsidian protrusions stand taller than a giantman, with sharp jagged edges honed over time after exposure to winds at this high altitude.  Fine ash mixed with smaller obsidian shards litter the path as it weaves between the peaks."
