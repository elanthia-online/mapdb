      "Hope Alley is an out-of-the-way district of small shops running between the eastern city wall and the streets of Temple Burrow.  Bright white and black granite pavers set into the icy landscape create a tony atmosphere in the narrow thoroughfare, and the citizens who visit its shops maintain a respectful silence in the presence of temple functionaries and members of the clergy."
