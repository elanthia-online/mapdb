      "Iridescent-speckled walls of bluish green silk decorate the narrow shop, the panels of fabric tumbling down into the sand-colored wool rugs covering the wooden floor.  Curtains of silver-woven netting partially obscure the latticed wicker racks affixed along the framework, while a set of nacre-flecked clamshells appears to float in mid-air, the thread-thin filaments suspending the containers caught by coral-crafted hooks."
