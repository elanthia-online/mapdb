      "Plain wooden walls rise from an unfinished wooden floor.  Just above a worn rug hangs a tattered merchant permit, and a mistwood beam ceiling completes the picture.  A jewel-inlaid caddy and a glass-topped mistwood counter stand side by side in the middle of the room.",
      "The broad sweep of the hardwood floor is interrupted by an open-mawed greater vruul statue.  Halfway to the vaulted ceiling, a snarling troll king mask hangs on one of the ribbed black willow walls.  A jewel-inlaid caddy and a glass-topped mistwood counter are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
