      "Streaked here and there with veins of citrine, the reddish stone walls are honeycombed with hollows holding huge coffins of precious metal.  Gold and silver and platinum glint in the murky darkness, shining here and there with adorning jewels.  Ravens are painted on the walls in a vast black flock that veers toward the northeast."
