      "The deck slants alarmingly to starboard.  One of a pair of ship's lanterns lies in a clutter of broken glass on the deck.  The other, still attached to its stanchion on the wall, appears to hang at an odd angle.  A sea chest has slid across the deck, leaving deep gouges in the wood.  A steep companionway leads down."
