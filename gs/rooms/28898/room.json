      "Brightly reflecting the sunlight, frosted globes dangle from the gutters of a scrollworked purple wooden wagon that is parked upon the painted cobblestones of the sprawling market.  Scrawling gold, silver, and purple lettering adorns the decorative waist board, while roller-scotches rest beneath the wheels to prevent it from rolling either forward or back.  Other shops in this section of the market give the structure a wide berth."
