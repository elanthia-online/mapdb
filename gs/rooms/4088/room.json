      "Whitecaps crash against the rocky shore, filling the air with sea spray and the scent of the bay.  The bluff rises above the scattered boulders, home to the nests of countless seabirds that swoop down from the watch above.  In the distance, merchant ships pass in the bay, their colorful sails moving across the horizon.",
