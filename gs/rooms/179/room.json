      "A finely constructed hall stands at the corner, its lovely stone walls carved with varying curvilinear designs interspersed with delicately wrought renderings of various herbs.  A small herb garden occupies the space between var and hall doors, the acantha and cothinar flower within lightly scenting the surrounding air.",
