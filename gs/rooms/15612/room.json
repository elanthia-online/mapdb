      "The hallway stretches onto the east, its crimson-hued walls lined with a variety of ornate ivory doors trimmed with swishing patterns of glossy ebony.  Small candles are held in gold-chased sconces, their flames lending a heavy, moody amber glow to the area as they flicker behind delicate glass panes.  Long velvet carpets line the floor, their faint glossy sheen reflected in the lustrous golden locks upon the doors."
