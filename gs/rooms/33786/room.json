      "Fences of sturdy wood frame a wide grassy meadow, their rough-hewn surfaces imbedded with lines of purple-hued thorns.  Tufts of wild clovers poke up from the ground, sprouting flowers of white and red and stirring with the mountain breeze.  Roltons flock about nearby, grazing and bleating."
