      "The creme-colored walls stained with water damage stand in stark contrast to the dark wood of the rafters overhead.  A lamp rests in the corner casting an ambient light across the room, while tufts of vegetation can occasionally be seen through a makeshift floor.  Several chairs covered in white sheets have been pushed around, creating a small maze leading to a series of makeshift tables lined up against the walls dressed in faded purple and mauve linens."
