      "Shadowed silhouettes of vultures roost within the knotty branches of an immense elm, a suit of lichen-encrusted armor slumped against the trunk.  Glass shards glitter in the weeds beneath the jagged-edged windows of a thatched roof bakery.  Nestled in brick and shingle rubble, a blackened boulder takes up residence within the adjacent destroyed shop.  Arrowheads and discarded weaponry sprinkle the muddied road with corroded debris."
