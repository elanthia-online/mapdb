    "description": [
      "Slick with seepage, the walls and floor provide the perfect environs for the proliferation of blue-green hornwort.  Their flattened bases cling to the rocky substrate, while their horn-like protrusions branch upwards, waving as one with any stirring of the oppressively warm air.  Overturned shells of deceased crustaceans collect enough water to support thriving colonies of striped, brown snails."
