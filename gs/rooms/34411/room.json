      "Placed under the large, open window, a small cushioned teakwood bench looks out over the lush green garden below.  A thick crimson carpet rests before a teak-trimmed arch, its silk drapes caught by a gentle jungle breeze.  Off to the side, a translucent crystal flute ringed with bands of white gold rests protected inside a gold-trimmed polished glass case upon a gold-flecked ivory marble stand."
