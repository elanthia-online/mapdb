      "The air is hazy with twining plumes of smoke, as breezes from the eastern riverbank breathe life into pockets of smoldering ash, reigniting what little is left to burn in the area.  Shimmering, glaesine waves of heat rise from the obsidian-like smoothness of the black water below.  Through the pitch darkness of night and the haze-laden air, a newly constructed pine walkway can be glimpsed continuing eastward through a freshly whitewashed gate leading off into the distant wetlands."
