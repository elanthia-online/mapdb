      "Wispy and thin, mist trickles in from the west with ethereal tendrils that slip through the high blue-green grasses before dissipating in the breeze.  Traveling along the gentle decline to the north is a small stream that cuts several tracks through the ground before tumbling out of sight.  Goldenrod and yellow-eyed asters dot the landscape with their splashes of color, while bright tangerine-hued, paprika rose bushes mingle with flowering maples."
