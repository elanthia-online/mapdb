      "Three garish wooden masks hang on the walls, each of them adorned with semi-precious stones for eyes.  The wall hangings are quite crude, the craftmanship such that they must have been made by an artisan of little skill.  Interestingly, the wood used to carve the pieces does not look native to the island."
