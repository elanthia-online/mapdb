      "The snow-covered lawn stretches up to a rambling log manor that blends into the surrounding forests with an uncanny grace.  The building looks inviting and cozy despite its sprawling size.  A front porch wraps around the entire facade of the building, and a number of stone chimneys stand guard on the roof, each spouting an aromatic plume of smoke.  Stone steps lead up to the porch, flanked by a pair of fanciful carved drakes."
