      "The small chamber to the rear of the shop has been protected from ransacking by its modwir door and a lack of windows.  Shelves and cases hold a variety of metal settings ranging from the utilitarian to the ostentatious, but to a one, they are works of impeccable craftsmanship.  A sickly sweet odor of decay emanates from a desiccated corpse seated in a rocking chair in the corner of the room.  Blue flames flicker from candles spaced across a small worktable, though the lights emit no heat and precious little illumination."
