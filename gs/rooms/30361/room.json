      "A soft breeze rustles the wide expanse of grass scattered with tiny wildflowers and enclosed by an ivy-covered stone wall.  Near a large meandering stream, a riverstone path leads to a large wooden dock.  Wrought iron tables and benches are spaced around a brick firepit amid clusters of tall evergreen trees, which provide pockets of shade.  Silvery lions mounted on the wall hold cut crystal oil lamps.  North of the path, bursts of color can be spied through the windows of a small copper-framed greenhouse."
