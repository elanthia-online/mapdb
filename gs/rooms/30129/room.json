      "A tattered map hangs above a shadowy black mahogany bed layered with plush furs situated near a window that runs the breadth of the stern, the view of the sea beyond superior to any painting hanging on the mahogany-paneled walls of this well appointed cabin.  The nautical charts strewn across a smoky amber mahogany table tell the ship's history at sea, while the details are all recorded in the log books stacked on a mahogany throne set on tentacle-carved legs.  A large sea chest occupies one corner, a lock securing its contents inside."
