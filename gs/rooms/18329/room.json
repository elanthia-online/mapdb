      "Ripples created by the waterfall feeding the lagoon provide enough motion to keep the glistening black liquid moving almost constantly as it laps in one direction or another.  Reflecting from the mirror-like surface of the water, moonlight plays across the lagoon in a neverending dance of pale beams, while deeper below, the shadows shift with the current.  The melody of the nearby waterfall is only occasionally broken by the call of a nocturnal creature.",
      "Ripples created by the waterfall feeding the lagoon provide enough motion to keep the deep blue liquid moving almost constantly as it laps in one direction or another.  An occasional piece of flora drifts in on a ripple of foam, its glistening surface reflecting the sunlight illuminating the lagoon.  Though the rushing melody of the nearby waterfall is prominent in this location, the faint chatter of local wildlife can still be heard from time to time."
