      "The trail nears the edge of a swift dark river, which runs down from a series of majestic, moonlit falls to the northeast.  A narrow stone bridge crosses the torrent, offering access to another trail leading up the steep incline of the mountainside.  To the southeast, the land stretches away in gentle rolls of smooth rock with striated bands of color visible even in the semi-darkness of the night.",

To the southeast, a landscape of brilliant white, gold and sienna stretches away in languid bands of color surrounding still pools of water as blue as the sky above."
