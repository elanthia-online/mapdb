      "Pale watercolored gossamer drapes from the crystal display, the airy curtains billowing across the unlit silver sconces wrought into the shapes of thin horns, the spirals traced with electrum filigree.  A lacquer-glazed counter stands upon a circular platform of checkered haon, the silver-toned wood inlaid with a similar filigree design."
