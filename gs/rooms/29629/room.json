    "description": [
      "Featuring an aesthetic best described as \"built by a captive shipwright,\" the dormitory is an upside-down ship's hull.  Wooden ribs arch overhead, supporting overlapping exterior clapboards.  Neatly made bunks with footlockers march down each side, interspersed with hammocks hanging from iron chains.  At the narrow bow, repurposed gangplanks rest on cannons, forming a makeshift table.  Whalebone candelabra cast dancing patterns onto the curving walls, illuminating a sprawling mural of a naval battle."
