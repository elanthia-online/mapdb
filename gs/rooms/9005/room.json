      "Dark velvet curtains cover every inch of wall space, keeping out both external sound and the bitter cold.  Seated upon a richly cushioned chair of polished hoarbeam is a middle-aged halfling in very fine garb.  The resemblance to the statue on Porter Street, which depicts the legendary Krolvin War hero Talbot Dabbings, is uncanny.  This must be his descendant, the no-less-famous Trevor Dabbings, the current patriarch of that august family.",
      "Dark velvet curtains cover every inch of wall space, seemingly in order to keep out both sound and the bitter cold.  Seated upon a richly cushioned chair of highly polished modwir is a rather youngish, but richly dressed, halfling.  You recognize a resemblance to the statue of the warrior in Porter Street and realize that this must be his infamous descendant, Trevor Dabbings, who first showed the residents of Wehnimer's the way to Icemule Trace."
