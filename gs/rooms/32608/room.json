      "Each side of the lane is fringed with several sturdy shops, their smooth slate roofs capturing some of the glint from the moonlight above.  A pennant stitched with the image of a waraxe flaps about, tethered to a long wooden post that stretches above a carved sandstone statue.  A cluster of wrought-iron chairs and tables litter the outside, allowing customers a place to rest and watch the crowds."
