      "Shapes darker than the night seem to haunt the moonlit path, some forms seeming to follow those travelers who would dare to walk among the ancient oaks.  The muffled crackle of dry leaves and the occasional snap of an unseen twig mark the movement of hidden entities within the overgrown foliage.  Sometimes, when all else is still, a husky thick-throated panting can be heard somewhere nearby.",
