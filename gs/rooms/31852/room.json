      "Circular glass lanterns hang from the haon-beamed ceiling, the globes engulfed by dark-toned bouquets of dried flora.  A velvet-padded rack stands against the back wall of the room, flanked by a set of vase-topped marble pedestals casting long shadows across the finely grained wood floor.  The long planks comprising the floor are speckled in black and rust-colored inks, adding dimension to the deep gouge marks across the edges."
