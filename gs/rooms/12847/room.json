      "A high, vaulted window arcs up the northern wall, its glass clouded and punctuated by blots of accumulated grit.  Sunlight streams through in fractured, dim beams, illuminating the large counter that stands underneath it, its gilded edges lustrous and its glass panes crystal clear.  Numerous herbs and plants are placed haphazardly upon many shelves near the ceiling, and an intoxicating mix of pungent aromas wafts through the area."
