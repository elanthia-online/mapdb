      "Sheets of heavy brown wool create a barrier between the chilly hilltop and the relative warmth of the brazier-filled structure.  Loose straw is scattered about the ground, the fresh rushes filling the air with an herbaceous scent.  Oak chairs line the walls beneath the warm glow of brass-sided lanterns that offer illumination for the wares available on the various mahogany trestles that support display planks throughout the space."
