      "The looming statue of a massive robed figure oversees the stretch of hallway, implacable features seemingly oblivious to the transmogrification of the corridor.  Spots of corrosion mar the work up to its knees, which stand nearly as tall as a full-grown man.  Luminous shreds of a substance, reminiscent of a spider's silk but vastly thicker and ragged at the edges, hang from the statue and drip from the walls."
