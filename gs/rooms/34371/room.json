      "Piles of bones, some with bits of flesh still attached and others gnawed completely clean, are scattered everywhere with nearly every section of ground covered.  About five feet in diameter, a creature-made hole has filled with a foul smelling liquid, and bits of debris float along its murky surface.  Thick, long scratch marks around the depression's perimeter suggest it was burrowed by a clawed animal."
