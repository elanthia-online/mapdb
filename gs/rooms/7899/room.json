      "You find yourself at the foot of a giant tree, which towers over your head rising about fifty feet into the air.  It is shaped in the form of an elf dressed in feathers with arms outstretched in front of it, holding something you cannot quite make out from here.  The forest surrounding the area is strangely silent except for the wind, which sings softly as it moves through the treetops above."
