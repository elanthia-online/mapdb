    "description": [
      "Bordered by bunks and accompanying footlockers, the barracks are close and tight.  Military precision keeps the area free of mold and smelling of polish, with just the faintest undertone of dried sweetgrass rising from the mattresses adorning each bunk.  A blossoming potted dragonstalk clashes brightly with the spartan nature of the rest of the chamber.  Well-tended, the sole hint of vibrant life rests atop the table at the far end of the chamber."
