      "Two lines have been scratched deep into the ground at either edge of the courtyard, which is littered with various contraptions that suggest its use as an exercise yard.  A small, brick chimney rises from the northeast corner of the barracks, thick oily smoke rising into the bright blue sky.  A cargo net draped against the outer wall provides a means of climbing to the platform overhead."
