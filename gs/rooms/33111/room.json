      "A row of precariously stacked wooden crates lines one wall, and opposite is a white ceramic basin on a large oak stand.  Nailed to the wall above the basin is a small piece of mirror, while a dirty linen cloth hangs from a nearby hook.  Covering the pine flooring is a worn, red wool rug, and a large starfish is nailed next to a door."
