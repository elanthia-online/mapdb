      "Plump linen cushions in various cooling shades are placed about a polished low driftwood table.  Soft, white sand covers the floor of the beach-like chamber.  Tucked about the room are plant-filled urns crafted from dark brass, the seagrass and colorful windflowers adding a tropical touch to the space.  Bright sea glass murals cover most of the walls, their shades ranging from golden yellow to dark blues and greens to recreate a beautiful coastal scene."
