      "At the heart of the space is the stove, an iron cauldron hanging suspended over its flame.  A heavy wooden table is bolted to the floor nearby, its surface nicked and scorched from years of chopping and spills.  Bundles of dried herbs dangle from beams above, swaying gently with the ship's motion.  Clay jugs of vinegar, grog, and water are lashed down in netting to keep them from crashing loose in heavy seas.  Along one wall, a curtained opening leads further into the depths of the ship."
