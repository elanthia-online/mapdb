      "Atop a series of timeworn steps, a disintegrating altar of ruddy stone rests in shadow.  Above it, the cavern's ceiling is oppressively low, and sharp stalactites sprouting from the raw rock seem to bear down on the steps like serpent's teeth.  Handprints and accompanying smears of tacky, dark liquid mar the ground and walls."
