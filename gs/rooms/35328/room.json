      "Vaulted ceilings and pendant lanterns illuminate the teller counters, which are hewn from polished granite with shimmering gold veins.  Behind the counters, an enormous wall mosaic crafted of veniom depicts Eonak at his forge.  Geodes of varying sizes and colors are embedded into the stonework, adding a touch of natural beauty to the room."
