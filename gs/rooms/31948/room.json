      "Several giantman-tall piles of discarded weapons and armor construct a hazardous maze within this open-air scrapyard.  A forge smolders away along the edge of the soot-stained red bricks of the adjoined smithy within arm's reach of an anvil accompanied by a tempering trough and grinder.  Assorted tools hang from a rafter set above the anvil.  A side door leads into the towering two-story building on the yard's eastern side."
