      "Cozy warm moisture fills the air as a blanket of low-lying steam hides the footpath and surrounding grass from sight, its source a bubbling hot spring whose blue-green waters feed a small calcium-ringed pool to the south.  Clustered close to the heat and dampness of the spring are agglomerations of sundews that have bright red rosettes upon yellow-green stalks.  Fountaining out of the ground to the west, bright white and burgundy sweetspires fill the air with their subtle fragrance."
