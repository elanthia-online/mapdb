      "You pass along the carpeted hall under the soft, amber glow of lamplight.  To one side is a heavy oak door with a misshapen knob and a small plaque set into the surface.  Across from it, a varnished wooden door leads to Lord Corwin's chamber.  Hanging on the wall nearby is a hand drawn map of lands you recognize as having been spoken of by Sages in ancient tales."
