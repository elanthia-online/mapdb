      "Spared by some trick of the winds and waters the ravages visited upon much of the area, the pier is mostly intact.  Rime gleams in ornate traceries from the pilings, punctuated here and there by clusters of ice crystals that shine like gemstones.  There are even some nails that have not yet been bitten down to rusting nubs by the salt and water."
