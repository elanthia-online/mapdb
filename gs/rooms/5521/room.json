    "description": [
      "Although only three stories tall, the square tower is substantial -- its walls constructed of large stone blocks.  Clearly more defensible than the manor house, the tower is crowned with battlements that provide deadly vantage points for its occupants.  The grasses and weeds growing between the paving stones have been trodden almost to extinction close by the tower and the half-raised portcullis that once protected its entrance."
