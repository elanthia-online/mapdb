      "In a silent copse at the garden's edge, sheltered by the bend of the castle wall, there sits a single grave.  The briar roses heaped onto the mound of earth are fresh, dew frozen onto their dazzlingly red petals like a dusting of diamonds.  A single spent candle sits before the headstone, the sweetness of its beeswax almost lost in the perfume of the neighboring verdure."
