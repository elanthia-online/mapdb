      "The pavilion's dark red, ridgeweaver silk walls are held up by slender, black oak poles, and they stir with the slightest breeze or movement, rippling like crimson liquid as they do.  Large piles of scarlet and black pillows are tucked neatly in each corner of the tent.  Two crystalline morduska statues stand as bookends on each side of a long, black velvet-lined case."
