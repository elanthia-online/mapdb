      "Surrounded by storm-shutters, a pair of glass-paned windows looks out onto the beach from their position along the northern wall.  Beneath the viewing portals, a farm-style stone wash basin is recessed into a long counter, while the walls above and to either side are filled with white cupboards.  Resting at the heart of the kitchen upon blue and yellow-checked tiles is an unadorned table surrounded by wicker-seated chairs."
