      "Snow swathes the wood plank floor of the hut, strewn with bits of grass thatching from a ragged hole in the roofing.  A bed that is scarcely more than a wool-stuffed mattress on the ground lies half-buried under the snow, spotted with the unsavory darkness of mold.  Oddly undisturbed, a carved whalebone figurine sits atop the hearth of a fireplace in the eastern wall."
