      "A flagstone terrace is ringed with tall trees and beds of flowers, each competing to outshine the others with an abundance of blooms.  The walk meanders, from a wooden gate framed by a high wall covered with ivy, to a shingle-clad cottage.  The dwelling is settled into its array of gardens like a jewel, the trees overhead dappling its curved roofline with shade and keeping the interior cool and comfortable.  A deep violet door opens into the cottage.",
