      "By night, the dominant hues of the courtyard are the delicate silver of reflected moonlight and the greenish-black of shadowy leaves.  Crumbling walls border the courtyard, demarcating the line between an untended interior and an equally wild exterior.  Broken slate tiles and shattered pots litter the ground around the remains of a fallen balcony.  A single shaft of moonlight pierces a jagged crack in the building's wall, but darkness dominates whatever lies beyond.",
      "Crumbling walls border the courtyard, demarcating the line between an untended interior and an equally wild exterior.  Broken slate tiles and shattered pots litter the ground around the remains of a fallen balcony.  Part of the building's interior may be glimpsed through a jagged crack in the wall, seeming shadowy and dim by contrast with the brilliant orchids and verdant leaves that fill the overgrown garden."
