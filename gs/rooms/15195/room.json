      "Smooth granite walls rise from a speckled black marble floor.  Just above a bronze peg-legged cat statue hangs a snarling war griffin painting, and a vaulted ceiling completes the picture.  A low wrought iron table and a heavy white granite counter stand side by side in the middle of the room."
