    "description": [
      "Partially sunken in the ocean floor, an elaborate monir figurehead set into the bow of the ship is eerily lit by a bed of luminescent green and blue coral.  Where the portside promenade joins the starboard, a glass door opens to the undersea ballroom, a splintered chandelier lying on the warped floor amidst rusty chains, spilled glass beads, and scattered teardrop pendants.  A lone lanternfish circles the wreckage of a raised stage at the far end of the ballroom, the watery hall's only performer."
