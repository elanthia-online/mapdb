      "Mud stains the lower half of the long canvas panels that line three of the shop's four sides and darkens the red strips along the hemline to a ruddy brown.  Spear-headed display hooks dangle from the awning's support posts, while a wooden shield-ringed rack is erected within the center of the structure to allow visitors to move around it for a better view of the wares.  A lone clerk watches warily from the entry."
