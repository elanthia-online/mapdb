      "Sunlight glints off the polished rosewood and mahogany decks.  A mahogany-framed entry inlaid with ornate gold filigree leads inside the riverboat, while the deck wraps about it all.  Carefully piled silk rope sits next to a gaily beribboned mahogany gangplank leading off the boat, which is adorned with carved mistwood albatross perched along the railings."
