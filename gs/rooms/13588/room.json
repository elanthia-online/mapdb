      "A vaalorian crested pennant hangs on one of the textured blue silk walls, and a sturdy oak beam ceiling rises overhead.  A serene golden wyvern fountain sits in one corner of a dark mahogany floor.  There is an intricately carved ebonwood stand on one side of the shop and a carved oak table on the other."
