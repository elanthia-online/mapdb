      "To the southeast, moonlight glistens upon a white cliff rising above the water to house an old temple of mellowed ivory marble.  The cool night air brings with it the smell of wisteria and jasmine mixed with the tang of salt air, and a few nocturnal creatures can be glimpsed frolicking in the surf."
