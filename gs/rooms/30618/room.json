      "Frosted globes dangle from the distant stone ceiling, providing a warm light that is reminiscent of sunlight.  Smooth walls filled with wrought iron grates stretch both to the east and to the west.  Flanking each other, a painted sign over the left-hand cell proclaims it as \"Gaol Three,\" while the right-hand cell is labeled \"Gaol Four.\""
