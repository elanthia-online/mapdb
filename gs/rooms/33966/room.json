      "Scattered about the long workbench that takes up most of the space within the small workshop are various bars of wax, jars of paint, and small cauldrons that rest on short-legged pedestals heated by votives.  Large lists decorate the walls, the greying parchment smeared with pigmented wax and listing the various ingredients needed to create tinted wax.  A small wooden bench sits to one side."
