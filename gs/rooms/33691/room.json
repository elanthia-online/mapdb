    "description": [
      "Coarse, sand-covered stones lend the niche a windswept appearance that once might have been decorative, but is now filled with small skittering bugs and piles of waste.  Painted patterns in a strange blue hue are faded upon the wall, the long skeins of silky webs littered with bug-filled cocoons blocking any ability to discern their meaning.  Standing guard upon the path that leads to and from this section of the niche is a glass and brass display case."
