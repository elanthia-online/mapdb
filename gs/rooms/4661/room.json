      "A lichen-coated boulder that strongly resembles a rabbit missing one ear rests beside an ivy-covered bungalow.  Placed just outside the doors of the building is a polished white-marble bench that has a raggedy toy sorcerer perched precariously on the edge of the seat.  A circle of light from the opened doorway illuminates ground that is paved with numerous multicolored tiles that create a superb mosaic depicting a kneeling elven child proffering a budding red rose to a woman of indescribable beauty.",
