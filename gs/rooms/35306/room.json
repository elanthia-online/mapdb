      "Pendant lanterns dangle over the area, casting a warm glow over deep blue tapestries adorned with the red eagle crest of Seareach.  Gold-trimmed display cases house snakestones in hues of green and blue, the carved pieces arranged upon copper-hued velvet.  A polished marble counter with swirling patterns of sand and sea stands before a wall of intricate mosaics that depict the coastal trade routes of Brisker's Cove.  Tanned bankers work behind the counter."
