      "Thick, wrought iron fencing crafted of gracefully twisted poles surrounds the pristine courtyard of the town theatre.  Loops and whirls rise above the elegantly appointed gate and support a sign fashioned in the image of theatre masks.  Disappearing to the north, a small alley positioned alongside a large building connects Pelican Lane to Crane Lane."
