      "Sunlight slips through the sheets of canvas where the binding lacing on the pavilion walls has come undone, the rawhide bindings flapping with small snapping sounds in the arctic breezes that slip in and out of the area.  Bales of hay covered in sailcloth or checkered tablecloths are positioned in rows along the edges of the space, their wares held down by rocks to keep them from fluttering away.  Small tufts of blue-green grass peak out from beneath the overlapping floor coverings."
