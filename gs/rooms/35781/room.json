      "Light reflects off of the polished copper underbelly of the roof's awning, that stretches protectively over a planked walnut door on the knotty pine landing.  Heading in a straight line to the grassy yard below, a sturdy knotty pine staircase is flanked by brightly illuminated lanterns fitted with radiant cobalt blue windows."
