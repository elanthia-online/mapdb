      "The ship's bridge is sealed off from the rest of the ship by a riveted imflass hatch that is reinforced with golvern.  Curving along with the forward bulkhead, great windows provide the ship's bridge with a panoramic view and allow in daylight that melds with the even radiance of glimaerstone spheres set into the overhead.   Chairs fan out across the raised deck in a half-circle, secured by heavy bolts."
