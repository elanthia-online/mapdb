      "Ocean water churns below, taking up a large portion of the flotilla's core.  A rope strung between two unsteady-looking poles is all that separates the denizens of the deck from a plunge, and a series of painted buoys has been wrapped around one pole for rescue purposes.  The deck here has deep score marks that look a bit too uneven to be from moving crates and are deepest right next to the edge of the pool."
