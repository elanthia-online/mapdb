      "Soot stains the circular wall enclosing the smithy, darkening toward the rafters.  The crisscrossing beams overhead are intensely black, stained by decades of smoke.  Near to a stone-lined forge, an old anvil with a veil iron face and horn is littered with fragments of glistening metal.  An oaken tool rack hung opposite the forge holds tongs, hammers, and pokers."
