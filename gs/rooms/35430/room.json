      "White plaster walls frame the entry room, with a smooth staircase ascending gracefully from one corner, its edges seamlessly blending into the wall.  Windows bordered by turquoise shutters feature built-in sitting shelves softened with plump cushions, inviting moments of quiet repose.  A recessed fireplace, flush with the wall, includes a niche above it for decorative accents and a round platform in front, perfectly suited for food preparation or warming small dishes in the cozy space."
