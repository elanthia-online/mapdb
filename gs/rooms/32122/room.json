      "Alongside the dimly glowing moldy fishing dock underfoot, a slow-moving stream empties into a deep pond in the middle of the mold-infested grove that surrounds it.  Mangroves cling around the water's edge, dwarfed by towering trees, all covered in thick patches of vivid, multihued mold.  Striated patterns of the luminescent growths have overtaken the leafless, entangled canopy above, providing their own unique skyscape."
