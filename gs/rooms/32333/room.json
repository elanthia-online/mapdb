      "Guarded by a long counter of dark-stained pine, the common room's bar boasts an impressive array of spirits in pristine bottles that come in all of the colors of the rainbow.  Several leather-upholstered stools sit along the counter's outer edge.  A half wall behind the bar provides a glimpse of the inn's kitchen and its hearths, above which game birds and other meats roast on wooden spits.  Nearby, a carved white pine stairway ascends to the second story."
