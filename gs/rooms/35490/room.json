      "A quintet of brass-chained lamps illuminate the iron-framed tobacco wood displays, the half-barrel lighting entangled in ivory-edged heartleaf and indigo hothouse nightbells.  The pale sky blue walls are threaded in metallic-colored silk clouds, the downy forms framing a crescent of silver-washed resaeun."
