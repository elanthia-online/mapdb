      "With the appearance of having been created by a madman, no two walls in this odd chamber are the same height or length.  Splotches of gray paint in varying tones coat the walls unevenly, causing further disorientation.  As if this were not enough, a dizzying array of archaic runes has been scrawled across every flat surface, including the floor and ceiling.  Crooked doorways provide the only relief from this visual assault."
