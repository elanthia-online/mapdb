      "Eyes of amber glint sharply from the mask of an ebony jackal statue, the shadow of which looms over an altar of obsidian.  The stone is roughly hewn and twisted, but it supports a chunk of pure dreamstone shaped into a crude orb.  Torches flicker in sconces along the walls, throwing back the darkness, but casting long and sinister shadows."
