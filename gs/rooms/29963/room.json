      "A constant, sluggish flow of thick crimson fluid cascades slowly down the eastern wall.  It drips heavily between the ill-fitted stones of the ceiling, dried black and crusty at the edges.  Primitive painted figures on the wall's surface have surrendered to the crimson flow, leaving the remaining lines looking half-formed and obscene."
