      "All about, leaves and small twigs litter the forest floor, but at the forest's edge, in this clearing, brush marks in the soft dirt show the care that someone takes here.  A pool of clear water dominates the area and feeds a small stream which meanders southward beside a small path.  At the edge of the clearing, two large stone pillars mark a pathway west.  Moonlight filters through the trees and seems to invite the weary to rest here in peace.",
