    ],
    "description": [
      "Five crooked piers float haphazardly along the outer edge of the flotilla, a series of ropes and pulleys hanging at the ready to collapse the docking system at a moment's notice for rapid travel.  The uneven decks are comprised of dozens of types of wood, most resembling salvage from ships' hulls, and some ragged bits of cork serve as minimal padding at each docking slip.  Hanging from a rickety railing, a battered sign reads, \"Kraken Pier - Slips 16-20,\" with a dark green kraken painted on the corner."
