      "The dark red walls of the pavilion are stretched tight by black oak poles, the slightest breeze causing the ridgeweaver silk to rustle faintly.  Along the back wall stands a dark bronze statue, depicting the image of a robed figure with his hands cupped outward.  Oddly, small rivulets of blood drip periodically from between the statue's curled fingers.  A long, red velvet-lined case rests near the northern end of the tent."
