      "A large black marble edifice stands in the clearing, nestled snuggly at the base of the nearby mountains.  Veins of silver and gold intertwine uninterrupted along the stonework, and closer inspection reveals nary a visible seam anywhere along the outer wall.  At first glance the building would appear to be formed from a single, solid piece of rock.  Set into the smooth marble wall is a platinum-banded ironwood door."
