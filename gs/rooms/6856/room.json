      "Pictures hang from the walls along this long corridor.  Portraits of important guests who once stayed in the inn, landscapes, and a wedding portrait of the proprietors while they still lived liven up the wood paneling between the guest room doors.  A simple wooden stair a little to the west marks the end of the hallway."
