      "The ranks of rune-carved columns from the south ends at the northern side of the grand hallway.  A golden light beckons from the south where a looming obelisk stands at the chamber's center.  On the northern marble wall flanked by torch-filled iron sconces, a pointed arch opening provides access to a chamber beyond."
