      "The Hall of Lords is an enormous round room with black marble walls and a floor of snow white alabaster.  Twelve granite columns rise from floor to ceiling in a ring around the Hall.  The room is dominated by a bench-flanked mahogany table at which the House conducts all of its official business.  Above, the vaulted ceiling is covered by a breathtaking mural."
