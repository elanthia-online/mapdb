      "A high watchtower stands guard over the bend in the road, guarding an expanse of the city wall.  Enforcers in cerulean and crimson staff the outpost, though they seem to devote less time watching threats from outside the walls than on those within.  Their tabards are emblazoned with the horned crab and dagger of the quartermaster's office, and they are a burly, hard-looking lot."
