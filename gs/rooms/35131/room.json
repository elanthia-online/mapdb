      "Broad blocks of salt slumber unattended in the yard of one nearby shop.  Coarse white crystals gleam in the moonlight from pitch-sealed pine barrels along the business's outer wall.  In the silence, traders in rugged attire haggle quietly over barrels, sacks, and bundles of the spice.  Above, the shop's weathervane, carved to resemble a ship's mast, creaks in the driving wind."
