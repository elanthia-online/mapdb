      "The lantern-lit walls are covered in parchment maps and sheafs of bamboo paper, the sheets pierced through the planks by sharp-bladed daggers, the weapons littering the perimeter of the dart board on the opposing wall.  Rope-bound salvage crates line the circumference of the room, the quantity almost burying a hay-lined chest of dried goods amongst the treasure.  A trio of repurposed oak barrels provide seating, the cylinders surrounding an iron-weighted ship's wheel."
