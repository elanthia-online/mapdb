      "Although shadows create darker spots within the shallows near the tall lighthouse, the moonlight still manages to pierce enough of the dark liquid to shimmer against the reflective scales of tiny fish darting around against the sandy bottom.  Clumps of kelp and sea urchins sway in the current as they cling to the dark rocks, seemingly waving to the fishes as they flit about."
