      "Time-worn stone markers breach up from the frigid earth, marking more than a dozen gravesites scattered unevenly across a clearing in the woods.  Pine and spruce and elder bend close overhead, as if in mourning, and the woodland is silent, devoid of the cries of bird or beast.  A ragged silk ribbon, faded with age, is tied about a low-hanging branch.  Its dangling threads whip in the whispering breeze."
