      "Long shadows occupy this section of the tent, cast by the tall poles supporting the colorful canopy.  Spanning several feet, a long wooden plank has been repurposed and painted into a wide blue-spotted shelf supported by empty ale barrels.  A polished brass tray rests atop a leaf-painted table along with an empty porcelain vase.  Beyond a rather hideously crafted iron rack, a rose-motif azure wool curtain obscures what lies to the north."
