      "Tiered gradations ascend toward a raised terrace, the pocked material from which they are formed looking to have been grown rathern than hewn into such configurations.  All along the border are obelisks in a jumble of spindly shapes, none entirely alike to another.  The edges of the platform look down on a sea of waxy, hexagonal chambers anchored to the ground.  They are possessed of a dark amber hue marred by deep red and livid violet splotches."
