      "Shadebinders in cinerious garb flank the doors and guard immense staircases of dark marble that climb toward the upper reaches of the Bastion, twining and interlacing at fantastical landings overhead.  A banquet table of inlaid widowwood stretches before a fiery hearth of grim stone fashioned to resemble a demon's yawning maw.  Sumptuously laden with bone porcelain, crystal goblets, and golden cutlery, the table is flanked to either side by ornate seats of ebony that are heavily clad in gilt."
