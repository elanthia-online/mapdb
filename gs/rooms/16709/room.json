      "A campfire burns in the center of a small nexus of paths surrounded by several makeshift tents.  Spits of meat, some with fur and hoof still attached, cook over the fire, casting a contrasting aroma to the foul air of the encampment.  A flagpole rises over the tops of the huts and tents to the west, marking the center of camp.  The beaten earth of the warcamp is littered with ragged bits of cloth."
