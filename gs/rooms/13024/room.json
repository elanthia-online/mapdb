      "Oddly, this room somehow managed to escape the fury that swept through the rest of the tower, and the bed, furniture, and bookshelf are all dusty but completely undamaged.  Lying on the unscathed mattress is a skeleton with its arms crossed peacefully across its chest, the bony form still fully dressed in elegant garb."
