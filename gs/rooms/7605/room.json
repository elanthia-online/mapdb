      "Wandering along here, the rough crunch of gravel in your ears and the smell of salt and sea air in your nostrils, you observe a large number of crabs of various sizes scuttling among the rocks and debris near the water.  The soft sounds of sleeping seabirds drift down from the cracks and ledges high up along the cliffs.",
      "Wandering along here, the rough crunch of gravel in your ears and the smell of salt and sea air in your nostrils, you observe a large number of crabs of various sizes scuttling among the rocks and debris near the water.  From time to time, seabirds swoop and dive to snatch one of the smaller specimens up to be devoured in relative safety among the cracks and ledges high up along the cliffs."
