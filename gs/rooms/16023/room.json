      "An immense fireplace draws the eye and dominates the trophy room, a collection of leather wingback chairs nestled before it around a table laden with knicknacks and trinkets from past forays.  Greens and browns from the thick pile carpet are captured in the mural portrayed across the recessed ceiling, muting the collection of well-preserved trophies scattered around the room."
