      "A wide, rutted road runs southwest between two culverts.  The road displays indentations from the passage of wheels, and few weeds attempt to grow in these indentations.  The road also continues to the southeast, though the ground appears harder there and the indentations are not nearly as noticeable.  A circular brick well sits to the east, surrounded by weeds and petunias.  A flowing wheat field extends to the northwest, and rocks are stacked in the culvert to allow access to the field."
