      "The smell of temple incense fills the air in this cluttered little shop.  Icons and sigils devoted to the gods and spirits, with accompanying candles burned in their tribute, clutter the tidy shelves that make up nearly every inch of the shop's otherwise unadorned walls.  A pedestal modeled on the the moon of Liabo and a plinth styled after Lornon display wares for sale beside a glass case with an oil-stained notice pinned to the wall above it."
