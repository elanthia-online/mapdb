      "The bones of a mighty steed tell a grim tale of unsuccessful flight from danger.  The steed's skeleton looks to be laid out in full stride, struck down by some fell blow to the skull.  Some longgrass has sprouted up through the bones, a yellowish-green reminder of the life that once flourished here."
