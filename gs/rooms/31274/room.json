      "Low-hanging boughs serve to muffle any ambient noise that might reach this space, making the very air around you peaceful and still.  Springy moss underfoot muffles any footfalls, and despite the omnipresent jungle at the perimeter of the graveyard, no untoward sounds reach this solemn area.  Rows of carved tombstones stretch away from the path in neat symmetry, some bearing colorful flowers and other offerings."
