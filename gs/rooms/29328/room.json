      "Dust obfuscates every surface in this faded room, rendering the formerly glossy dull.  A stray sunbeam bisects the room from window to door, its golden luminescence kindling motes of dust in the air into tiny flecks of swirling gilt, transmuting mundane into magic.  An overstuffed armchair rests next to an imposing tanik worktable littered with oddments and ephemera.  A precariously perched candlestick, its pricket drowned by a puddle of congealed wax that once proudly thrust its flame aloft, threatens to tumble off the worktable to an untimely demise."
