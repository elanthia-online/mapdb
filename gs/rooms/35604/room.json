      "The Spicers' Sea forms a boundless expanse of water, stretching silently toward horizons devoid of recognizable features.  Drifting tangles of kelp and seaweed provide fleeting refuge for small fish darting anxiously within their shelter.  A dead shark carcass floats lazily on the surface, plagued by scavenging pelicans."
