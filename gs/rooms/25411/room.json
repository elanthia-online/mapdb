      "Stone ramparts line the entire perimeter of the rooftop, each section evenly spaced and fortified to allow equal protection and a staging ground for archers.  Rising from the center of the area is a crisp silver flag emblazoned with a silver phoenix and it flaps with the slightest of wind.  Beyond the highest point of the outpost, the grasslands stretch out far to the south before they disappear into the forest, and the palisade walls and buildings of Wehnimer's Landing expand to the north.",
