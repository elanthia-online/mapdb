      "This small, bare room seems to have been no more than a storage closet in earlier days.  The addition of some faded wood paneling and a rickety desk and chair has converted it to a makeshift office.  A dusty, gold-framed portrait of a portly human in a ceremonial snowcat vest hangs askew above the desk, and a surprisingly heavy oaken door is set in one wall."
