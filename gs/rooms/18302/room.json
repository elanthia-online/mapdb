    "description": [
      "The gurgling sounds of various murky, water-filled pockets of mud upon the ground contribute to the ominous environment of the swamp.  Insects buzz as they light upon the muck collecting in a partially decayed log, joined by the incessant drone of mosquitoes that call this dark place home.  The slime covering the rotting vegetation makes travel a cautious venture, only enhanced by the dangling liana vines draped down from the few trees managing to survive in the habitat."
