      "Artwork of Arkati and spirits cover the walls of this small room, portraying those that claim neutrality.  A door inlaid with rune-shaped cinnabar leads back out towards the orchard, while a thick curtain heads further inwards.  Standing center in the room, a large mahogany table is cluttered with jewelry-crafting tools, a felt-lined box, and a paper-stuffed tray."
