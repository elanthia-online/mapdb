      "Moonlight catches on the rippled surface of the river as it cascades down low, rocky steps between the high, moss-blanketed banks.  Frogs croak over the murmuring water, hidden in the whispering reeds where fireflies blink in and out of the darkness.  Tucked beneath a round table of stained glass beleria framed in lasimor, latticed chairs provide a front row seat to the aquatic symphony, shadowed by a mixed canopy of foliage."
