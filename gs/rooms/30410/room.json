      "A sandbar juts toward the southwest as the eastern shore beckons with hopes of safe harbor.  Rocks obstruct the surface of the coast and destroy all such hopes.  The blue of the sea contrasts with the black of the rocks, while the watery expanse of the western waterway is riddled with breakaway bits from the obsidian cliffs."
