      "Small birds flit through patches of wild flowers that dot the narrow bank along the shallows.  Grey ash clumps along the water's edge, and much of it remains trapped within the stalks of fiddlehead ferns and cattails that jut from the mud.  Tethered to a stout wooden dock, a row of soot-stained rafts bob up and down in the shallows near the glaes-inlaid, grey granite wall of Bentock's Adventurers' Rest."
