      "A ragged carpet of fog covers the forest floor.  A sparse game trail makes its way out from the underbrush and shortly opens up into a wide, well traveled pathway running northwards.  Deeper in the woods an enormous oak looms above both the path and the trees around it.",
      "Dark night air fills the gaps between the trees here.  The only illumination is the far-off pinpoints of light that mark the presence of fireflies deeper in the woods.  Suddenly the forest is flooded with bright light as a line of torches burst into flame.  Making its way out from the underbrush and running past the torches is a path leading deeper into the darkness."
