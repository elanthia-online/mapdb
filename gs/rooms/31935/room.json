      "Perpendicular to the stone road, a narrow shiplap building spans the back edge of an archery range.  Round targets form an orderly line at the far end, their faces deeply pierced by arrows and spilling straw from old wounds.  Enclosing the grassy yard, a low wattle fence offers an unobstructed view of a sprawling ruin within the trees to the north, the dilapidated state a stark contrast to the neighboring picturesque streets."
