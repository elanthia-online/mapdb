      "Stone walls reinforced with iron bands enclose the cramped back chamber, its corners crowded with office furniture and storage racks.  Facing a sturdy door exiting to the foyer is a scarred desk strewn with ledgers and quills set beneath a barred window flanked by mesh-fronted cabinets holding tagged parcels and tools.  In the corner, a cold iron stove rests, while a single lantern overhead throws long shadows over a worn chair."
