      "Rough wooden planks reinforce the starboard bulwark to either side of a heavy ballista.  The housing for the mechanism is a blackened iron sheet that is encrusted with sea salt.  Coils of rope hang from the belaying pins along the warped railing, some even trailing over the side into the water below."
