      "A faint glimpse of moonlight peeks around the huge tree-trunks to the northwest, while darkness stalks in the opposite direction like an immense predator waiting for prey.  The tangle of vines and creepers loop between the trunks, their intricate leaves and clumps of roots and trailers silhouetted against the faint greenish-glow.  A large root snakes alongside the trail, throwing up a row of iridescent flowers on delicate stems that follow its meandering route.",
      "A brighter level of green gloom peeks around the huge tree-trunks to the northwest, while emerald darkness stalks in the opposite direction like an immense predator waiting for prey.  The tangle of vines and creepers loop between the trunks, their intricate leaves and clumps of roots and trailers silhouetted against the hazy glare.  A large root snakes alongside the trail, throwing up a row of bright yellow flowers on delicate stems that follow its meandering route."
