    "description": [
      "The salty air from the harbor has bleached the wooden supports for the roof white, and rendered the floorboards of the porch itself gritty and pockmarked.  A small semicircle of curved sofas surrounds a wrought iron brazier and faces generally outwards towards the harbor itself.  A rhimar chest has been strategically placed between two of the sofas, allowing for easy access to its contents.  Dangling from the roof overhead are a series of well-worn cargo nets, interspersed with small glowing globes."
