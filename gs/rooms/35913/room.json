      "Beneath the limbs bedecked in strands of gold-glowing paper lanterns, tiny fireflies dance between each individual luminary as if stringing them together with threads of light.  The effect is mesmerizing, making of the surrounding branches and leaves stained glass mosaics that gleam under the touch of the flickering light."
