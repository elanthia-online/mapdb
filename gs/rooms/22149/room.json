      "Deep armchairs covered in midnight blue velvet are scattered about, creating a striking contrast to the paneled walls of golden oak.  A matching couch, flanked by a pair of end tables, sits before a large riverstone fireplace, a basket of sticks placed nearby.  Filled with wildflowers, a painted ceramic urn rests between two etched glass windows, their frames draped in sheer white silk.  Pewter sconces provide light for reading, and shelves filled with a variety of books line the back wall interrupted by a beveled glass door."
