      "A craggy statue of a leaping marlin stands between two fishmongers' shops.  Some of their product, curing in the cold air, blankets the street with a briny, too-sweet odor held almost at bay by aromatic evergreen logs burning in a brazier before the southernmost business.  The other shop's windows offer a glimpse onto preserved pufferfish and shells suspended from a line of sinew, the decorations hanging above a display of fresh-caught fish on ice beds."
