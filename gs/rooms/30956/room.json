      "The smooth wooden planks of this round table bear the pale hue of cypress that is now and again broken by vibrant splashes of color where tiny columbine and speedwell blossoms have been preserved beneath a thick varnish.  A tall, slender vase of translucent sepia glass is set to one side and displays slender forsythia clippings, each bearing dozens of the tiny golden flowers.  Offset slightly is a small white votive."
