      "A faenor-forged brazier dominates the center of the shop, obscuring the western room in sparks of burning resaeun wood scenting the interior.  A series of glass-encased weapons sit between the ceiling-high racks, the various knives resting on beds on soft suede.  Solid slabs of metal and blocks of wood are neatly arranged in the far corner, the materials carefully arranged in a stack of barrel-crafted crates."
