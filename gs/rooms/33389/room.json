      "A circle of sandstone benches surrounds an imposing sculpture of natural fulgurite, its base buried deep into the mottled dark sands beneath it.  Square-caged lanterns radiate from the fractal form towards tall posts of blackened iron, diminutive lightning bugs casting greenish gold sparks against the cloud-etched glass as they slip in and out of the receptacles. The faint scent of ozone and sea rosemary fills the air, followed by a tinge of earthiness."
