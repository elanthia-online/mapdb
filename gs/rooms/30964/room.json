      "Separating the promenade from the courtyard is a low white stucco wall, which is bisected by a series of stone steps that is flanked by ropey bougainvillea vines housed in enormous terracotta planters.  Concentric bands of ebon, white, green, red, and blue travertine pavers surround a burbling fountain under the watchful eye of illuminated frosted globes.  Rising in a spiral from within the fountain's water is a copper sculpture depicting a pandemonium of parrots."
