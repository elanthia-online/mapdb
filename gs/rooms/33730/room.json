      "Carefully arranged across the floor are plush, powder blue carpets patterned with multicolored interlocking bubbles.  The rear wall of the chamber is comprised of numerous small, locked compartments.  For your convenience, your personal locker is placed on a low granite-topped counter.  On the wall opposite the counter hangs an oil painting rendered in vivid colors."
