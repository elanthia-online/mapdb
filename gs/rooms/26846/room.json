      "A heavy curtain of pale smoke sweeps across the room, the rich fragrance of amber-saturated spice permeating the cloth-swaddled baskets lined up against the corners.  A carved wooden camel kneels before brocade tapestries comprising the back wall, the creature lacquered in vivid cobalt paint."
