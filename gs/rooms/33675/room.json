      "Dusty images decorate the cobblestone walls of the niche, the faded paint creating the image of a harbor filled with ships.  One ship stands out among the rest because of its black sails and the red flag that it flies.  A glass and brass display case sits in the center of the room and has several skeins of webbing that stretch from its brass edges to the nearby walls."
