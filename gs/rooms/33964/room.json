      "Rotted hammocks sway from the exposed rafters of the room, the sodden rope and cloth structures dripping into stagnant pools upon the uneven ground.  Verdigris veins paint the copper portholes that gaze out into the streets beyond, their dirty windows limned in violet, cerulean, and coral hues as the perpetual twilight attempts to spill through the glass.  Footlockers, trunks, and barrels are scattered throughout the room, their warped faces mottled with bright white barnacles."
