      "Built between two buildings, the narrow shop has a roof of overlapping canopies that are nailed into a series of boarded up windows on either side.  Cobblestones gleam in the ambient light where the smooth stones lining the ground have been scrubbed to a near luminous quality.  Despite the odd construction, the shop is tidy and utilizes old ale casks to create a sturdy table along the western wall."
