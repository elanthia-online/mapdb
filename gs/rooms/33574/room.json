      "The dark canvas of the marquee is lit with a warm glow by six globes of light suspended from spokes that radiate out from the king pole at its center.  The eastern and southern walls of the tent are lined with tall haon shelves, each neatly stacked with merchandise for sale, leaving the northwestern corner occupied by the tools of the tanner.  A large drying rack stands empty next to a crate piled with tree bark and an assortment of barrels filled with varicolored liquids."
