      "Filled with the scent of cedar and sandalwood, the small sleeping chamber is heated by a single bronze brazier that occupies the corner opposite a layered pile of sleeping furs.  Opposite the open white oak door is a grey, black, and white pebble mosaic that stretches from floor to ceiling, its greyscale hues reflected in the nearby driftwood chairs.  A small table in the northeastern corner has various sundries and a volcanic rock wash basin."
