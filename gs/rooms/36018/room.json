      "Set at the edge of a small hillock where a line of alternating larch and birch steps rise toward the summit, a small market spreads across an open expanse with its borders shaped only by the placement of stalls and carts.  To the northwest, the broad paddock of grazing animals lies in clear view beyond the shifting grass.  Near the market's center, a rowan tree grows in a sturdy, upright form, its feathered leaves and bright clusters of berries standing vivid against the open sky."
