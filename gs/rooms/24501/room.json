    "description": [
      "Thick forest, interspersed with several varieties of plants and vines, encircles a large meadow.  Wildflowers add a kaleidoscope of color to the lush, green grass on either side of a cedar chip path.  Sunlight glints softly off Lake Eonak through the flora around a modest home on the far side of the meadow.  Melgorehn's Reach rises sharply into the blue sky above the home, the peak wreathed in clouds."
