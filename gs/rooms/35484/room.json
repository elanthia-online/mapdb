      "The vert-colored walls of the pavilion are engulfed in tendrils of heartleaf, the brushed maedatha interspersed with ebony-carved blossoms of unfurling taerethil.  A trio of iron-framed tobacco wood displays stand at various heights at the center of the room, the bottles highlighted by an expansive chandelier of jewel-toned florals, the stained glass casting kaleidoscopic beams across the wood-planked floor."
