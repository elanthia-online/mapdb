      "Thousands of wild rose petals carpet the cold stone floor, filling the chamber with a sweetly perfumed smell.  To either side of a heavy oaken panel leading out to the chapel, golden torch sconces support torches that bathe the antechamber in bright light.  Despite the roses' aroma, there is a creeping scent of death wafting up from a crumbling stone staircase leading down into stygian darkness.",
      "Thousands of crushed, dried rose petals carpet the floor, blackened with age, their fragrance long since departed.  Golden torch sconces adorn the plain fitted stone walls, but no torches sit within them.  It is dark, yet quiet, lending a sense of serenity."
