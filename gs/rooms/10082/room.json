      "The leaded glaesine windows are paned in a delicate floral pattern, detailing intertwining roses and ivy.  The windows are framed of the same garnet-hued curtains that decorate the front portion of the shop.  A thick sapphire-hued carpet covers the floor.  A series of shelves lines one wall, providing ample storage for the gem dealer's supplies."
