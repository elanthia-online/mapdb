      "Sturdy aspen planks stained in bright vermilion are set upon stumps unevenly stacked across the muddy grounds, creating a haphazard area to view the jousting grounds.  Bales of twine-bound hay provide additional seating, although handfuls of the dried grass have been plucked from numerous stacks by some unknown observer.  Tall poles frame the back of the area, each one decorated with a makeshift phoenix silhouette crafted from black canvas."
