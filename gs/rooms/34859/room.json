      "Riven from the subterranean as if clawed by some monstrous beast, a massive cavern unfurls, revealing a preternaturally still underground lake.  Far overhead, tiny arcane lights wink in and out of existence, looking for all the world like a vast night sky twinkling and reflecting off the lake.  At the water's edge, a vine-choked gazebo sits, its entrance flanked by a half-moon ebonwood table piled high with a gallimaufry of wares."
