      "The glaesineth-enclosed deck has a small door leading into the shop and a brass-edged koa gangplank climbing up to a second-story door.  Small openings at the top of each wall let in the sea air, and their transparent nature allows an unfettered view of the dunes and ocean.  An anchor-topped coil of hempen rope sits neatly in one corner, the anchor polished to a high sheen.  Painted onto the artfully sea-weathered wood of the wall is \"Welcome to the Dire Ebon Vengeance!\" with a brass ship's bell hanging next to it."
