      "Lush velvet curtains are drawn over the office's windows, allowing in only the faintest glow of sunlight.  The day's radiance is confined to feeble pools near each window, so the duty of lighting the chamber is left to branching candelabras sitting on a large writing desk and atop a bookshelf near the door.  The chair behind the desk is almost a throne.  It is upholstered in dark red leather and its bloodwood frame clad in gilt filigree."
