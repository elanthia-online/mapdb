      "Crowded by the densely packed shadows of nearby arboreal giants, a maroon and iron-gabled manse dominates the corner of the avenue and is positioned so that its shutter-flanked windows can keep an eye on the various lanes that intersect at this corner of town.  Slipping beyond the manicured lawns to the east and the cramped structures to the west, a narrow pathway disappears southward, while an arching arbor hosts a plethora of painted plant life as it offers entry to a small alley."
