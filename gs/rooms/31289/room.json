      "Bolted against the far wall a small workbench, with an ironwood chair secured behind it by iron latches, sits beneath a row of pegs that hold assorted cobbling tools.  Some small crates line the edges of the workshop, with markings that indicate the contents as assortments of cobbling supplies stored for future need.  Beneath a small brass lantern, a latticework divider leads out to the rear of the wagon."
