      "Natural light slips through cracks in the ceiling where trailing vinca dappled with periwinkle flowers add a splash of color to the granite.  Cool and temperate, the air along the northerly descent is filled with a rich, earthy scent, as well as a touch of moisture.  Slanting at an angle, a half-rotted modwir is wedged in amid some rocks, its surface covered in vibrant yellow-orange hen-of-the-woods."
