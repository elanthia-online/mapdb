      "Flat bone fragments have been bonded together and shaped into uneven stepping stones, which winds around a dilapidated stone statue and then leads further into the ruined settlement.  Lining the walkway of bones are a few ramshackle homes, where withered black flowers seem meticulously planted along window sills."
