      "Tendrils of fog seep out of cracks upon the low ceiling of this rounded corridor, the wisps flowing down toward the floor to shroud the cramped tunnel in a thick haze.  The blurred forms of scattered stones can be seen upon the ground, their rugged surfaces covered with tiny mushrooms.  Dark red moss hangs down from the fissures above, the fuzzy curtains tinted a sickly hue by the outpouring mists."
