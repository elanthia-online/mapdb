      "Thatch-roofed buildings cluster together along the edges of the cobblestone road, which follows the eastern edge of a high cliff towards the sea.  Squatting amid smaller structures, a large inn painted with decorative seaweed along its balcony supports and front porch stands open for business.  Somewhere nearby, someone plays a quiet tune on a shawm."
