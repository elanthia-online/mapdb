      "The tall open-air stall is framed in blackened iron, the greenhouse-like structure curtained in veils of ivy, the subtle shadows dancing across the narrow limestone building set alongside the shop.  An arched entrance is set at the side of the stall, the doors held open by ice-filled stacks of crates, the containers branded with various images of fish.  A long wooden counter divides the two structures, its perimeter bordered by wrought metal chairs cushioned in striped sailcloth."
