      "Beneath a black marble-tiled ceiling with a few cobwebs in the corners, a pair of crossed serrated rolaren claidhmores with deathstone pommels hangs on one of the mica-flecked black marble walls.  A locked invar-banded crate etched with dwarven runes and a locked imperial blue trunk etched with elven sigils sit in opposite corners while an antique suit of battle armor on a white marble pedestal rests on a black and white checkered marble tile floor."
