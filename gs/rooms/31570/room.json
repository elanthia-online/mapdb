      "A brass bell gleams atop a polished ebony desk across from a set of paned-glass doors, the streaming sunlight illuminating the dust motes dancing above merlot-hued carpets running the length of the dark-stained wooden floors.  Behind the desk, numerous keys hang in a wooden rack labeled with numbered brass plates above slots filled with addressed envelopes.  An arrangement of velvet-tufted sofas in assorted jewel tones fill the space in front of a walk-in fireplace of grey riverstone."
