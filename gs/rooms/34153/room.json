      "At the end of a twisting warren of narrow caves, the cold and lightless delve into the earth reaches a series of wider, less claustrophobic tunnels.  Signs of intentional excavation exist in the jagged stone jutting from the ground and walls.  The air cold and still, but there is a faint odor on the air reminiscent of stale vinegar.  Fungus grows thick on the walls, but its faint blue-green phosphorescence does little to hold back the dark."
