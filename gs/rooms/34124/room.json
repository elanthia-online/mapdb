      "Ringed by snow-dusted conifers, this quiet little glade is situated near the main gathering area.  The thick, shaggy trees form a windbreak against the biting breezes, as well as a baffle that dampens noise from the adjacent festival grounds.  Littering the ice-crusted ground are crisscrossing footprints that indicate numerous visitors."
