      "Piles of wood and scrap metal clutter the open-air smithy that occupies this portion of walkway.  A sturdy rock forge and leather bellows sit beneath a brightly striped canvas awning bearing the golden wyvern of House Vaalor.  A heavy weapons rack and a sturdy armor stand proudly display the blacksmith's wares."
