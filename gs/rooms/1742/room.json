      "The mountains just to the west rumble ominously under their weight of snow.  No trees grow on the mountainsides, and nothing appears to be positioned to block an onrushing avalanche.  Piles of snow hundreds of feet high spread out nearly as far from the base of the mountains, testimony to the sheer volume of frozen water that the peaks can unleash with little warning."
