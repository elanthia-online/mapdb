      "Stretching from the foyer in the north to the alcove in the south, a long fuzzy runner of shaggy white roltalen muffles the movement of those within the hall.  Large windows capped in keyhole arches dominate the western walls with their leaded, stained-glass designs and each is surrounded by a plethora of frosted globes that keep the expanse illuminated.  Here and there, doors provide entry to various workspaces that stretch beyond the white stucco walls."
