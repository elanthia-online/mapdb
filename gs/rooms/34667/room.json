      "Glass displays spaced throughout the room hold samples of the lapidary's art: tourmalines fashioned in the shapes of teardrops, diamonds cut to enhance their splendorous white fire, and firedrops winking like solid flame scattered across beds of black velvet.  Though not large, the shop appears prosperous, its floor patterned with porcelain tiles forming a pyramid of charcoal and lilac squares.  A fresco on the eastern wall portrays a plump, long-haired lapidary plying his trade with a hammer and chisel."
