      "An off-center carousel sits half-buried in the blackened mud, consumed alongside several wooden benches bordering the broken ride, separating it from the houses encircling the area.  The painted horses have been ripped off their poles, torn limb from limb, then discarded in a pile of ichor-stained detritus."
