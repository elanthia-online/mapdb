      "Traces of silver along the curved arches of the vaulted ceiling mutely reflect the illumination from a large pool of magma in the center of the spacious chamber.  On the north side of the hall the formal elegance of the platform and chairs arrayed around it emphasizes the rawness of the rough-hewn stone and the primordial fire of the lava."
