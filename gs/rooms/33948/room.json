      "Cooled vapor hovers in the air, and tendrils of hoarfrost pattern the walls and ceiling of this crowded space.  An icy blue frost-covered crate nearly fills the entire corner, the floor slick with ice around it.  Moist floorboards are riddled with mold, warped and swollen from exposure to constant gusts of dry heat from the eastern corner of the shop."
