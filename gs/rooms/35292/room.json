      "Enormous urns of calla lilies, hyssop, and ligularia rest upon the alabaster altar, which is illuminated by the soft glow of starlight filtering through the open dome above.  Smooth and cool to the touch, the stone's surface is devoid of carvings, though the steps leading down the dais and into the sanctuary are heavy with battlefield frescos.  A sense of peaceful quietude fills the air."
