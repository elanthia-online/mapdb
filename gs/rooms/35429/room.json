      "Replicas of the various ships on sale are scattered about the gravel yard, their polished hulls and intricate details clearly defined by the starlight.  Beneath a large striped canvas canopy that offers welcome shade, workers polish the vessels while mahogany tables display detailed catalogues of additional ships available for purchase that are filled with illustrations and specifications.  The scent of fresh tar and wood polish fills the air."
