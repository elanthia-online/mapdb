      "Located near the waterfall, the small cavern chamber is opened to the sky through a large fissure.  Acting as an air vent, it allows the chill of the arctic winds to howl downward creating a dull, resonant din throughout the room.  Stacked neatly against the walls are blocks of ice that have been chipped from the frozen lagoon beyond."
