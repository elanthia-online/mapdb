      "Exposed beams of dark walnut support the lofted ceiling, their lengths reinforced with strips of dark bronze.  Thick ivory wool carpeting blankets the floor except for a small tiled area before a small ivory marble fireplace.  Centered in the room is a live-edge ash table surrounded by cushioned armchairs that face away from a mistwood and glaesineth door.  A ceramic bin of sticks rests to the side partially hidden by lengths of pale silk draped across a curtained archway."
