    "description": [
      "Light and airy, the shop's interior features polished birch floors with matching shelves, cupboards, and counters, all filled with various baking and cooking goods.  A display case highlights numerous pastries and other delectables, and behind the main counter stands a diminutive baker.  One wall is covered in a detailed mural of an isle surrounded by turquoise seas, a haze of indigo mist lingering amidst the tiny village on its shores."
