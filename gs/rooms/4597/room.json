      "Glazed and then polished to a mirror-like finish, a half-moon shaped modwir desk stands slightly off-center before several rows of tall bookcases.  Well-maintained ancient tomes, scrolls, and manuscripts have been neatly placed inside of a locked glass cabinet.  To protect its contents, the cabinet has a thick tri-colored rope surrounding it to prevent anyone from coming too near.  In each corner of the room are vibrantly colored potted plants."
