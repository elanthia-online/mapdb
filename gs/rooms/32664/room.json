      "The room is jammed with silvery metal containers, making it difficult to move around.  Containers are stacked upon containers, from the floor to the ceiling.  All of them are roughly the shape of cubes, though their surfaces are warped to eliminate flatness and right angles.  The electric blue lighting sparkles off the highly polished metallic sides, increasing the illumination in the room and intensifying the strobe effect."
