      "Pendulous clusters of sea grapes hang thick along the entry, parting into a symmetrical chamber enclosed by smooth, curving shell.  Deeply emerald shaleflare moss densely carpets the entirety of the floor, its gently luminescent nodes reflected dimly in the arched spans of nacre rising to the ceiling."
