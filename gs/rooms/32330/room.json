      "Through a break in the snow-dusted boughs of a great spruce, the silhouette of a castle at the top of the hills is black against a halo of moonlight.  Old and grim, the fortress looks down on a small city from its lofty perch.  Atop the walls of the city, faded crimson pennants fly, bearing the sigil of a briar sprig against a rising charcoal moon."
