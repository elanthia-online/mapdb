      "Solid stone on either wall has made it necessary to carve a steep bend to continue the shaft.  The stone is scarred with numerous attempts to widen the gap, but evidently without success.  A few twisted pieces of metal litter the ground, remnants of what must have been a pickaxe at one time."
