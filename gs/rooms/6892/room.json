      "A metal and wood cage, still sturdy and speaking of good workmanship, is affixed to one of the walls.  Large enough to hold a sizeable creature, it is certainly large and strong enough to contain a man.  A chair leans in the opposite corner, keeping an empty watch on the no longer present captive."
