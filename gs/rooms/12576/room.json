      "To the north, the granite rock tilts steeply up necessitating a climb, while to the northeast, the way follows the course of the dark, rushing sluice.  Small pools of water dot the face of the stone terrace, collected from the ever-present spray.  Moonlight glints off the pools' surfaces, showing occasional ripples that betray the presence of denizens within their limited domain.",
      "To the north, the granite rock tilts steeply up, necessitating a climb, while to the northeast, the way follows the course of the rushing sluice.  Small pools of water dot the face of the stone terrace, collected from the ever-present spray, and gulls stalk their edges in search of small crustaceans.  The querulous birds create a din with their raucous cries."
