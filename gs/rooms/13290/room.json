      "Slashes of a variety of shades of green, from chartreuse to emerald, mimic the canopy of a densely packed forest.  Shelves made of deadfall branches, their bark still in place, jut out at odd angles from the walls.  A clear golden orb hangs suspended from the ceiling by braided birch bark cords."
