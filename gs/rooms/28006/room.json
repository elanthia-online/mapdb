      "Fluffy white catkins cling to one of the young aspens that grows to the southeast of the interlacing game trails that converge in this section of the grove.  Growing in clusters around the sapling are dozens of ghostberry shrubs, their thin branches laden with bright white berries and pale pink blossoms.  A rich plum-hued yurt fashioned of woven goat hair rests just off the snow-lined trail in a patch of sunlit alpine grass."
