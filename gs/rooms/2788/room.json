      "Here at the top of the wide stairway, one has a good view of the expansive great room below.  The banisters sweeping down to the lower floor are intricately carved in a pine cone motif and polished to a high luster.  A long hallway stretches north, one wall occupied almost entirely by a large oak door.  The green length of the hallway is carpeted in a finely woven runner depicting a pattern of pine needles and cones."
