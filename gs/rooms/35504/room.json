      "Leafy maedat-shaped topiaries flank the heartleaf-draped doors of the sun-bleached limestone houses, the spaces between the buildings occupied by silk-canopied booths showcasing their wares.  Lengths of vivid glass faerthiel are strung across the rooftops along the cliffside, casting a kaleidoscope of colors upon the expansive cobblestone courtyard."
