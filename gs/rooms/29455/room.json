      "A curved ironwood sofa covered by velvet cushions along the western wall faces the opposing side of the room, encompassing a long, oval ironwood table.  Hanging from the eastern wall are several sets of manacles, while oiled leather whips and flogs dangle from nearby hooks.  Another wall shows off a collection of wickedly curved daggers, sitting on metal spikes driven into the stone."
