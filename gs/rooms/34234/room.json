    "description": [
      "Several alcoves are dug out of the walls of umber stone, most sealed by a hard, translucent substance with a distinctive ochre shade.  A glistening resin of the same hue, reminiscent of thick tree sap, drips from the walls of one sealed niche, and has begun to harden in glassy patches.  Hot air, sulphurous and heavy, belches from a jagged vent in the uneven floor, its revolting odor of rotten eggs almost eclipsing the overwhelming stench of vinegar."
