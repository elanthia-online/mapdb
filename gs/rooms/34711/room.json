      "Shelves have been anchored into the crumbling walls of the rookery, lining all of them but the northernmost.  Stairs proceed through an arch in the north wall, climbing toward the rookery's tower.  The way is lit by a pair of feebly burning torches in iron sconces spotted with rust.  A chorus of caws and the soft thunder of flapping wings echoes down the stairwell, amplified by the narrow space of the stairwell."
