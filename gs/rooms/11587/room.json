      "The angle of the ship causes the pair of small starboard windows, smaller and less ornate than the leaded glass stern windows, to look down on the choppy water of the bay.  Loose furniture lies jumbled and damaged against the bulkhead.  The deck is littered with papers, charts, overturned inkpots, a dented brass lantern, and the shards of a whiskey jug."
