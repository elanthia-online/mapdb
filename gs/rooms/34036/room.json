      "Accessible only by the virtue of a colossal stone bridge, a broad ledge juts out of one of the lowest faces of a lofty mountain that stretches into the swirling clouds above.  A vast breach yawns out of the cragged mountainside, and lightless gloom beckons beyond.  Despite the snow that heavily blankets the mountain, the space before the ragged aperture is mostly clear."
