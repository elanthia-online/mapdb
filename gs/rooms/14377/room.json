      "Rising majestically from the sea-like flooring of the area, a spiring clock tower, formed of blue-grey granite, dominates the plaza.  A large display platform juts forward on the front and two sides of the structure just below the actual timepiece face, high above.  Around the base of the tower are set three freestanding cubic plaques of bronze, silver and gold.  Walkways fan out from the square in seven directions: northeast, northwest, east, west, southeast, southwest and south."
