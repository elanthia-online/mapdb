    "description": [
      "The plateau leads to a steep cliff that overlooks the dense jungle.  A swaying rope bridge connects the cliff to the monastery below as it stretches over the forest's canopy.  A parting in the leaves beneath the bridge reveals several motes of torchlight glistening from the forest floor.  Centered in the plateau stands a run-down citadel, the majority of its towers and walls cracked and broken.  An arched doorway, long bereft of an actual door, leads deeper into the stronghold."
