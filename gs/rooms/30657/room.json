      "Several pillars, carved from the mountain and plated with unpolished mithril, line this vast meeting room.  Heavy wooden benches have been arranged in rows to face a stage in one corner of the room.  Woven tapestries depicting the dwarven arts of forging, mining, and war have been hung with care along the walls.  Fluorescent toadstools have been strategically placed around the room in order to keep the area well lit."
