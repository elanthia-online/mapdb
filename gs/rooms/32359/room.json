      "As they have aged, the planks of the pier have curved away from one another to form a wide fissure.  The waters of the Frostmain surge up and through in crashes of white froth and icy water, leaving behind cakes of salt to decorate the wood.  Between surges, the waters are deep and black and foreboding.",
      "The wood of the westernmost pier has silvered unevenly, leaving a strange stripe pattern in the warped planks as they alternate between grey and black.  The nails securing the planks are spotted with rust that makes each look as if it sits in a pool of old dried blood.  Traceries of rime glisten from the wood, lending a glint of natural beauty to the manmade decay."
