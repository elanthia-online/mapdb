      "The stones of the village's henge lay toppled amidst the encroaching greenery of the icy forest.  Some of the stones are cracked as if by great force, and many are smeared with gore and grime.  Graven into the frozen earth is a crude serpentine symbol with two heads.  Snow has covered it over in parts."
