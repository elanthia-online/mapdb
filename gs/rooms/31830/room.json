      "The languid river flows between steep banks, its steel grey waters offering no reflection of the skies overhead.  A dented helm has been discarded in the mud along the shore and nearby a hatchet is sunk into a fallen timber.  Smoke can be seen in the distance drifting upwards in random patterns."
