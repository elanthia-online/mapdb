      "In this section of the swamp, the malodorous fragrance grows increasingly stronger.  Lofty, yellow grass with bearded heads bows slightly under a strong gust of foul wind, sending tiny grains sailing through the air.  Shadows flicker across a ramshackle little shed as the breeze stirs the branches of deformed trees, which surround it.  A pile of bones that are slowly turning to dust rests beside a deep pit that is a few steps away from the shed.",
