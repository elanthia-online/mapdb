      "The packed dirt floor and large flat rocks within this pen are dimly illuminated by several large lanterns that have been placed along the perimeter. Flames lick at a broad, thin stone suspended from short stone supports over the sunken fire pit in the center, set adjacent to a small watering hole dug at one end.   Arrayed around it, several lizards lounge with their bellies exposed to the warmth emanating from the fire, while the largest lizard asserts its dominance by lazing upon the rock platform itself"
