      "Fine white sand dotted with small dunes obscures the wooden floor, reinforcing the illusion of a tropical beach.  A white cotton rope hammock has been tied between two support beams decorated to resemble palm trees.  Painted on a nearby wall is a vivid oceanscape complete with a bright yellow sun."
