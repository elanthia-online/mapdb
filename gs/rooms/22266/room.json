      "Most of the buildings along either side of the street are shuttered, their doors closed and windows mostly boarded over.  Several of the structures look deserted, a glance into the windows revealing nothing more than empty rooms and sparse furniture.  The path is empty of people, the villagers either indoors or elsewhere."
