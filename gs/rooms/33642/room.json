      "Rotting piles of old hay lie in blackened heaps against the wall, their thick depths filling the air with the scents of mildew and decay.  A downed hitching post lies at the water-warped feet of several other posts, their ropes frayed and unusable.  Here and there, a stray stone has tumbled free from the wall and trampled the overgrown grasses."
