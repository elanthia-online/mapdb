      "Covering the dark stone floor of the guild shop is a rich ebon carpet shot with slender threads of silver.  An iron rack of clothing stands off to one side of a set of marble shelves.  Centered in the room is a small wooden table holding an etched crystal case.  A series of frosted glass globes are suspended from thin pewter chain, swaying slightly as they coldy illuminate the area."
