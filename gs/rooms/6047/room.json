      "Here at the far southwest corner of the corn fields, the soil is poor and yields little in the way of nutrients.  The nearby forest trees and bushes have sapped the available nutrients over the years, and even though the closest trees have been cleared away, the soil has not yet had time to recover.  The corn stalks are barely a foot high, and more light grey than dark grey.  Even the weeds do not seem to like the soil here, evidenced by the large patches of totally barren ground.",
