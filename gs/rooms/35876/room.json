      "Booths and stalls comprise a busy market that serves as a hub of commerce within Kragnek Dzu, bustling with activity as crafters and merchants toil away with their wares.  A small stone shop stands in the middle of the market, displaying a row of finely crafted, colorful metal scabbards in its only visible window.  Large canver trees entwine their branches over a walkway leading southwest, toward a row of squat stone houses."
