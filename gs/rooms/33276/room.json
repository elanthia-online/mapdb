      "Shaggy cypress, planted in close proximity to one another, form a natural barrier that hides the view of a nearby tower, its wicket, and its grounds, while also providing a bright green contrast to the uniform grey and white of the lane.  Avenues branch off, each seeking the center of Vornavis and departing from the protective shelter of the Vornavis-Solhaven wall.  Shadows encircle the green copper gates, despite the orbs offering pulsating illumination, a guard just visible beyond its access point."
