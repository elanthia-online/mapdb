      "Dominating the rear wall of the chamber is a carving striving to escape the unfathomable slab of black marble.  Marlu, features contorted into a countenance of rapturous furor, is caught mid-lunge, barbed tentacles grasping the edges of the wall as if it were possible to tear himself free of the carving.  Beneath his gaze is a gore-slathered altar, atop a rusted metal grate strung with ribbons of decaying flesh.  The smell is inescapable, except perhaps through an ebon gate beneath Marlu's demonic visage."
