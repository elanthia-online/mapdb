      "Arabesque-patterned copper tiles sweep across the ceiling complementing the sumptuous mazarine rug covering the floor.  Dominating the eastern wall is a colorful etched-glass map that sits opposite a series of bay windows.  Hushed whispers echo across the open floor plan as various business negotiations take place at modwir desks and plush chairs clustered together.  A cobalt velvet couch wraps around a corner, enclosed by a free-standing latticework iron bar."
