      "The red, grey, and brown cobblestones which pave the lane have been arranged in a mosaic pattern of a huge striped tiger, its claws outstretched beneath your feet and its tail curving somewhere farther down to the east.  Small landscaped lawns surround the neat little cottages on both sides of the lane."
