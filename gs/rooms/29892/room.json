      "Fir and tamarack trees near to the edge of the water shake and shiver in the gusting gales coming off of the river.  Near to the water's edge, an woven bark basket lies on its side, half-frozen into the ice.  The basket is great in size and would be extremely cumbersome even if it weren't partially imprisoned in unyielding frost."
