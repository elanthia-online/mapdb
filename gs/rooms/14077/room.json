      "Charred bales of straw lay stacked in a far corner.  Soot has covered the ceiling with a smoky blackness and the walls have been horribly scorched.  The shoulder high stall doors along the northern wall all seem to have been broken open with great force.  The wood around the door latches has been splintered and huge shod hoofprints mar the surface."
