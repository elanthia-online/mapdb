      "A blue watered silk tapestry hangs on one of the polished oak walls, and a mosaic tiled ceiling rises overhead.  A pile of striped throw pillows sits in one corner of a polished oak floor.  There is a flexible willow woven basket on one side of the shop and an oval-shaped speckled marble counter on the other."
