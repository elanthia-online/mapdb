      "Bright colors and light zydris accents bring a touch of Cysaegir into the marble halls of the bank.  Polished white floors reflect the natural light streaming through large windows recessed into the ceiling, while pendant lanterns supplement the lighting as needed.  The walls are adorned with delicate zydris carvings, showcasing platform trees amid ambling brooks.  A desk of golden zydris with intricate grain lines stands as the centerpiece, its surface meticulously organized with ledgers and scrolls."
