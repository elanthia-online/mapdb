      "Harsh golden light illuminates the chamber, blazing from torches that pepper the air with their smoke.  Much of the space is cordoned off by a half-wall of darkly stained mahogany, a wrought iron grate barring access to the riches beyond.  Treasure beyond an avaricious fever dream's ability to encompass is neatly catalogued and arranged in coffers behind the counter, from gold and silver coins to trade bars in exotic metals, along with a mind-boggling variety of furs and textiles."
