      "The narrow, rock-strewn strip between the high water line and the low leaves little room for navigation.  Patches of sea lettuce cling to the rocky shore, holding fast through the ceaseless assault of the waves.  Elongated, dark blue mussels are anchored to the intertidal rocks, clustered together as though afraid to face the sea's wrath alone."
