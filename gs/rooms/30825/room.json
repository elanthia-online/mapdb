      "Loosely pushed together rockpiles form a narrow bridge between sandbar and shore.  Thick bands of amber-hued sand on the ocean floor act as braces for the rocky bridge, the water darkening visibly as it passes beneath.  At either end of the long and precarious pathway, white sands glimmer in the ambient light.",
      "Thick bands of amber-hued sands are visible in the water, each acting as a brace for the rocky path.  The water darkens visibly as it passes through this part of the bridge.  White sands are visible just ahead."
