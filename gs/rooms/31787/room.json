      "The loud boom of colorful fireworks echoes over the charred buildings surrounding the cobblestone walkway, the smoke hovering over an oversized toy box affixed with six faintly glowing locks.  The lid of the box has shifted slightly ajar, causing tiny turquoise crocodiles and crystalline crabs to spill out, skittering off into the dark corners.  A two-headed serpent toy mechanically hisses menacingly as it wends across the container, its bright purple scales etched with nine giant Xs in crimson paint."
