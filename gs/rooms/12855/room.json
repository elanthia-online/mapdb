      "Large crowds gather around a small square of dying grass in the center of this courtyard.  A number of bearded men, each equally grubby and yelling unintelligibly, stand upon crates scattered in the square.  At the base of each granite residence that surrounds the courtyard, a bedraggled man or woman sits, trying to attract attention with a pouch of stones, a deck of cards or a glass ball.",
      "Trampled and dying grass covers the small square at the center of the courtyard, its weeds yellow in the soft moonlight.  Discarded bottles are scattered amongst crates that are arranged in odd clusters throughout the area.  At the base of each granite residence that surrounds the courtyard sits an empty rocking chair or cushioned crate."
