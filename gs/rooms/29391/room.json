      "Glimmering multicolored lights scallop the shutters of the brightly painted shop facades running down the lane in oblong boxes, many of the decorated doors festively hung with intricately wovens knots of hemlock and pine.  Past the lot's outermost corner, a hedgerow of coral red flowering quince serves as a natural fence encircling a stone-inlaid courtyard."
