      "Gold-set oil lamps hang between the windows, casting the area with a warm light that gilds the oak of the walls and furnishings.  Set perpendicular to the windows and nestled against the wall is a long golden oak bar laid out with a variety of drinks and edibles, while a glass-framed wall case hangs opposite.  Beneath the case is an octangular oak pedestal table, and across the way, an archway leads eastward and further into the ship."
