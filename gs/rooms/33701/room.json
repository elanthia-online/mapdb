      "Bright and airy colors in this room counterbalance the darkly stained oak floors and dim light filtering in through a white linen-curtained window flanked by a pair of sconces. On opposite walls, a carved white door and a carved light blue door lead to adjoining rooms while the center is devoted to entertaining guests.  A pair of soft leather couches and a whitewashed driftwood table serve as a comfortable seating area, while a large glass aquarium divides it from the entry area."
