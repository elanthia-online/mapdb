      "Crates of paper are stacked about the outer edges of the pavilion, several topped with origami unicorns and lizards.  Set upon a plum-colored carpet, an expansive cherrywood desk and a dark mahogany cabinet display several samples of fine origami paper, a small silver-bound chest tucked between them.  Prominently displayed near the entrance is a silver-framed notice."
