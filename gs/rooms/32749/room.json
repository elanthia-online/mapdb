      "This room is brightly decorated with summery primary colors.  A bright yellow carpet patterned with green ivy covers the floor, accentuating the dark green curtains and bright yellow walls.  The large four-post bed features oversized yellow pillows above an elaborately embroidered comforter.  An elegant crystal vase on each night table holds a small bouquet of yellow roses."
