      "Tucked against the blue tile walls of this rather cramped storeroom, a teak shelf rests above a mosaic sapphire-inlaid table holding some stone mortars.  Rivulets of water trickle down the walls from a pair of open windows high up to collect in a meditation pool, giving the eastern wall an oddly sad resemblance to a crying face."
