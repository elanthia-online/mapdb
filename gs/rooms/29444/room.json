      "Myriad racks and tables clutter the pavilion with wares spilling out everywhere.  Resting dangerously close to a tiny heated stove, a solstice tree brushes against a ragged and dangling banner.  Dozens of crystal balls teeter atop a stack of summoning tomes, and swathes of silk in various hues randomly decorate the canvas walls."
