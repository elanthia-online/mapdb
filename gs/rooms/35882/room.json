      "Flat slabs of dark basalt form the walls, floor, and ceiling of the perfectly cubical space that is the shop's interior.  Worktables line one wall, covered in various tools used to work with leather, gemstones, and metals.  The other side of the shop is lined with fully stocked shelves, attended to by a pair of young dwarves dressed in white-striped, teal and grey uniforms.  A pair of wrought invar lanterns, one on each side of the shop's large window, provide ample amounts of light."
