      "Braziers filled with hot coals sit in three corners of this small, irregularly-shaped, wooden room, filling it with wet, oppressive heat while droplets trickle down the walls.  Opposite the plain door leading out, an uncomfortable-looking square stone bench provides a place to sit.  Alongside, a clay ewer is filled full of water with a wide-bellied ladle hanging from the rim."
