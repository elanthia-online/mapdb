    "description": [
      "Limestone walls enclose the undercroft's entry, with a single torch barely giving enough light.  An eerie fog fills the room, its presence clearly unnatural.  Vaulted ceilings give the entry a very spacious feel, however, a pile of rubble blocks any further passageways that would lead deeper within.  Along the northern wall, a granite archway stands before a limestone sarcophagus, while on the southern wall, a granite staircase leads up."
