      "Shallow rents spiral the circumference of the sloped burrow, interrupted by several cracks along one stretch of wall through which a fetid yellow slime slowly oozes.  A thin river of the viscous stuff wends along the declivity of the tunnel floor, joined by a rivulet of dirty water dribbling from an elevated cleft in the southeast wall just wide enough to allow passage.  The mouth of the tunnel opens wider to the northeast, where a drift of sulfurous mist faintly fogs the air."
