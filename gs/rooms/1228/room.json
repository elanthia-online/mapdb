    "description": [
      "A small clearing appears here, giving a brief respite from the claustrophobic trail and allowing a dim bit of sunlight to penetrate to the ground.  The brambles and trees have been forced back by a bubbling spring, and the reason for vegetation's retreat is immediately apparent in the sickly yellow tinge to the water and the heavy rancid scent in the air.  The sulfurous water bubbles up, only to flow a few yards and disappear noisily down a muddy, sucking hole.",
