      "Patinated copper pipes line the walls in intersecting patterns, some wrapping around a single small glass window painted an opaque black.  A coat rack crafted of welded mismatched gears stands off-kilter beside a dark sepia trunk with a broken lid.  Stacks of crates in the back partially hide a broken metal door."
