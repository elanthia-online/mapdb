      "Several ivory couches are arranged atop woven sea green wool that covers the center of the smooth white marble floor.  A linden-framed oval mirror hangs above a large riverstone fireplace with a small basket of sticks stands ready next to the hearth.  Crafted with expert detailing, a beautiful dolphin statue seems to leap above a scrollworked pedestal.  A polished dark marble blackboard is positioned near the arch that leads into this room, a silver-edged driftwood medallion set at its apex."
