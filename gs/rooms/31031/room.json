      "Sunlight streams through glass panels in the ceiling, creating pools of dappled luminescence on several ornately carved oak tables.  The tables contain dozens of fragile glass jars, each jar holding numerous slender sticks of varying colors.  Interspersed among the tables are potted palms in clay planters, and a marble bench rests against one wall.  A young clerk stands behind a glass counter, attentive and at the ready to serve customers."
