      "A lustrous teak floor reflects the glow from the many candles flickering softly around the room, revealing the furnishings.  A large overstuffed leather chair and a white chaise lounge provide comfortable seating arrangement, while a large wrought iron bed piled high with quilts and comforters dominates one wall.  Another contains a built-in bookshelf filled with volumes on magic alongside lighter fare.  Above the bed is a stained glass window in a fleur-de-lis pattern."
