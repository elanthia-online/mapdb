      "Mounted up high on the main mast, a small teak platform encircled by a slender brass railing serves as an observation deck.  Underfoot, a trapdoor opens up to a ladder of ropes, the ratlines a complicated maze of knotted hemp.  A swivel-mounted sypglass lays dormant, the brass instrument etched with a sinuous kraken."
