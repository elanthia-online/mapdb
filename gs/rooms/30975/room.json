      "The backroom of the store is far more muted and austere than the brilliantly lit entrance.  Small workbenches line both sides of the room while the back wall has technical diagrams mounted in silver frames.  In the center of the room, a small wooden table sits atop a plush wool rug with several lanterns above it providing a dull, steady illumination."
