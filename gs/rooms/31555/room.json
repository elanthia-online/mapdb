      "This cramped space only has room for a huge lens fashioned from clear glaes and brass.  The luminous filament that used to burn oil has been changed to a mage-enhanced blue crystal.  The crystal that was more than fifty times brighter than years past ensured the safety of the merchant ships that travel these waters but now is burned out and useless.  A rusted iron chain hangs from the ceiling of the light tower and below it is a dull red sign."
