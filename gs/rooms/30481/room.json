      "Less populated than their brethren to the north, the rocks look like veined marble as they continue the towering barrier.  The glossy black of obsidian and duller charcoal color of basalt are veined with the greyish-white of guano trailing down their faces.  A constant breeze brings the welcome scent of the sea, unfortunately tinged with the smell of hundreds of birds."
