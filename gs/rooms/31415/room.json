      "Piles of origami paper are crammed about a slightly dusty wood desk, several splattered with an indeterminate crimson substance.  Dangling from the ceiling are numerous origami figures arranged in combat, and a tiny origami replica of Duskruin Arena sits between a small silver-bound chest and a stained parchment notice."
