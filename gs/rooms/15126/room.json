      "A braided cream and sapphire blue cotton mat rests on the mosaicked tile floor near the shop's entrance.  An elegant silver-framed mirror, etched in each of its corners with a simple stalk of celery, hangs directly behind a mithril-trimmed counter, placed on the smooth, polished maple walls.  The burnished, vaulted plank ceiling is complimented by the potted monkeyflowers that mark the passage to the interior rooms of the shop."
