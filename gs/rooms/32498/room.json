      "Hideous symbols in blood mar the honeycombed walls of the barrow, the sinister luminescence throbbing from the sigils less bright but steadier than the flicker of torchflames lighting the path.  Blazing in unnatural reds and violets, the torches proceed toward an arched opening to the southwest.  The fire almost manages to hold back the oppressive cold of the frozen earth."
