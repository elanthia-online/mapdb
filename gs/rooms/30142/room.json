      "A rectangular sail hanging from a wooden mast casts a large shadow across a misty grey spruce gangplank, while rigging creates a dark, web-like pattern across the planks of the main deck. Along both sides of the ship, some cannons stand at the ready.  A lone gull circles overhead, its sonorous call a greeting to those on board."
