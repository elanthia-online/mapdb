      "Red-upholstered seats fan out to either side of a wide aisle, down which flows a scarlet carpet with dark grey piping.  The walls are ornate murals of swirling petals adrift on a breeze and look as if they are flowing toward the stage.  Several candles burn in nooks along the walls, casting the house in a burnt orange glow like that of the sky at dusk."
