      "Stalagmites jut from the uneven floor of the cavern, their jagged tips pointing unerringly at a rolling ceiling of black granite that is mostly lost in the darkness.  A clear path through the forest of stone bends toward a rough ledge.  Phosphorescent fungi glow in profusion, but their light is wan and silvery, making it look as if the rock formations are bathed in a veil of faint starlight."
