      "A strange chill from the sea blows through this deeply shadowed corner.  Faint rustling and scrabbling can be heard from the underbrush.  The trees lean over the blackened cobblestones, their branches almost touching each other.  Lost in the shadows, a sole guttering lamp fights vainly to illuminate the path.  Through a locked scrollwork gate, a dark mansion of black marble stands barely visible."
