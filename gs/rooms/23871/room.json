      "A massive cedar tree occupies this space in the circle of trees, its branches reaching out to meet those of its neighbors.  The scent of cedar permeates the area, mixing with the heavy fragrance of patchouli that lingers in the air.  Carpeted by leaves and shreds of bark, the path around the trees is hard to follow here.  Branching off from the main path, a thin trail leads towards a clearing in the center."
