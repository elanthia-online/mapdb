    "description": [
      "In no better state than the outside, the interior of the hovel is cramped with aged furniture and wooden debris.  Along the back wall, a lopsided shelf holds empty jars, old tools and scraps of cloth which cascade to the floor.  Portions of the floor have long since rotted away, while the remaining planks are coated by oily sludge and swamp water.  An old chair in near-perfect condition sits in one corner, untouched by the dust so prevalent elsewhere."
