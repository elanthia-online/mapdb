      "Aspen-covered hills gently roll into a grassy meadow where the cackling call of a distant woodpecker harmonizes with the querulous tone of a red-breasted bluebird.  Wildflowers bloom in a riot of color, the purple coneflowers complementing the fiery red poppies and a swathe of violet-tinged blue irises add intensity to a patch of sunny buttercups.  A hollow log along the edge of a footpath hosts a growth of white-spotted red mushrooms."
