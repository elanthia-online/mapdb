      "In the trek from north to south, the size and breadth of the trees have grown, with smaller, weaker specimens having been overtaken by vines and fungus, while the remainder have grown seemingly unfettered by the nuisances that have felled others.  Their enormity nearly defies belief, and in their higher reaches, well beneath the shelter of the bowers, what appear to be small porches can be seen stretching out from doors or warmly lit archways."
