      "Supported by a bough of a cocobolo tree, a low-hanging swing creaks as a slight breeze pushes it over a bed of colorful flowers.  Warm sunlight filters through the leafy cocobolo, leaving checkered patterns of light to illuminate the mossy floor.  Every now and then a monkey or two swings from the branches of a nearby tree to the south, paying little notice to the goings-on below.",
