      "Mahogany paneling runs the length of the room, from the floor to the gold-leafed edge of the domed ceiling.  Long, lavish red velvet curtains on golden hooks spill down to barely caress the polished oak floorboards to the north.  Numerous votive candles in glass holders spread a soft illumination throughout the room.  A long plush velvet divan is pushed against the eastern wall while a carved rosewood table with a vase of red and purple orchids sits opposite it."
