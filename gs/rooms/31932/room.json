      "The once luxurious furnishings of the store have been overtaken by a massive assortment of spare parts, bent pieces of metal, and clusters of junk.  Dozens of pots and planters house the remains of dead vegetation in various states of decay; not a single leaf bears even a hint of greenery.  A rune-carved dark ironwood door leads to the work room in the back of the shop."
