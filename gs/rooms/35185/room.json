    "description": [
      "Poorly illuminated, the shop has a single lantern to light the space, which leaves most of the wares that are on display in shadows.  Sparsely furnished, there is a low wooden counter along the eastern wall where a robe-swaddled merchant covered in veils that leave only her eyes visible warily watches customers.  A blue cloth-covered table sits in the center of the space, half-in and half-out of the shadows."
