      "Though dimly lit and moderately chilly, this storage cellar is free of dust and appears well maintained.  A sturdy modwir table is covered with a crisp white linen tablecloth.  Beside the table, a single burning wall sconce illuminates a neatly carved sign.  Filling the remainder of the space, a large solid oak rack holds row upon row of hand labeled wines."
