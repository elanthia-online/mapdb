      "Inside this small ger, several mannequins are scattered haphazardly about amongst a littered floor covered by dead leaves, nut husks, and shriveled berries of various sorts.  Criss-crossed lattices of birch, pine, and rowan make up the khana, which is covered by a thick layer of felting and held in place by large bands of leather.  A wide loft, accessible via a narrow ladder, hangs above the mannequin's heads, blocking their view of the roof ring."
