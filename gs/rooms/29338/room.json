      "Though several windows are set high on the walls of the wagon, they are rendered dysfunctional by the black paint smeared across them.  The only light comes from the mismatched paper lanterns overhead, and dangling among them is a garishly painted notice edged in tiny shiny gold pinwheels.  A shabby velvet-padded case boasting an eye-shaped sign sits on one wall opposite a dark cork head with a head-shaped sign staked in its cranium on the other.  Beneath the notice is a dingy ribbon-tied basket with a silver star-shaped sign on the handle."
