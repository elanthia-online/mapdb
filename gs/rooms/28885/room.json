      "Cliffs pockmarked with puffin burrows rise towards the sunlit sky, the rocky protrusions casting shadows upon the surrounding cobblestone streets.  Clotheslines stretch from anchors in the cliff face to the balcony of a nearby inn, their lengths laden with sheets, towels, and aprons that sway in the seaborne breeze.  Isolated and alone, a single lantern perched upon its wrought iron pedestal sits at the corner of the street where the road declines to the southeast.",
      "Cliffs pockmarked with puffin burrows rise towards the starlit sky, the rocky protrusions casting shadows upon the surrounding cobblestone streets.  Clotheslines stretch from anchors in the cliff face to the balcony of a nearby inn, their lengths empty and swaying in the seaborne breeze.  Isolated and alone, a single lantern perched upon its wrought iron pedestal sits at the corner of the street where the road declines to the southeast, shedding a small circle of illumination.",

Nestled at the base of the cliff is a flickering portal."
