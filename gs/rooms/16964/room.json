    "description": [
      "The area is in a constant state of shifting haziness as whorls of stifling hot steam eddy in thick clouds and rise toward the ceiling.  The surrounding walls are slightly curved, allowing droplets of moisture to accumulate upon the wavy patterns incised upon their crystalline surfaces.  At the far end of the chamber is a swirled triple-tined vent, its interior releasing howling bursts of steam every few moments.  Identical steps lead upward into both west and east walls."
