      "Coarse, unstained planks of oak with pine trim line the four walls of this tiny, single-storied storefront.  Badly frayed fishing nets dangle from the ceiling rafters, scattered with cracked oyster and scallop shells tangled within the fibers.  A smooth, honey-hued oak counter with various bagged and boxed goods rests against the back of the room below a cherrywood-framed mural of Caligos Isle."
