      "This long room has been separated into numerous individual stalls, each equipped with several troughs.  One trough in each stall is full of liquid that glows a pale bluish-green.  This could be attributed to the soft electric blue lighting from overhead, but the color of the water isn't quite electric blue enough.  A second trough in each stall carries some sort of grain, while a third trough contains a slurry of mashed weed.  The floor is covered with black pellets."
