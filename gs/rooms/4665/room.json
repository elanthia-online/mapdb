    "description": [
      "Low, drooping branches of a willow tree gently caress the surface of the warm, crystal clear water.  Wisps of steam rise up, prompted by the thermal vents along the bottom of the spring, and create a series of effervescent bubbles that glide along the surface.  Moss clings thickly to the tree, and every so often a strong breeze causes a flurry of its catkins to take flight.  Thriving swamp buttercups break the surface and lily pads float serenely around the circumference of the pond."
