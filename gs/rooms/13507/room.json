      "Dimly lit, the gallery looks out to the north over a significant drop, a northeasterly ramp providing a more pleasant form of egress to the hall below.  Carpeting pads the gold-veined granite floor, its chocolate hues echoed in the wool padding a raised alcove to the south.  Set into the display is a segmented steel arm."
