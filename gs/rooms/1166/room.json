    "description": [
      "The wind rustles through the trees to provide a soft, whispering sound.  Maples, walnuts, cottonwoods, birches and several other species of tree reach toward the sky.  Their different shapes and colorations contrast pleasantly, relieving the monotony that might occur should they all be of the same configuration.  The elms in the area look to be a bit blighted, though.  Several of them are yellowed and losing their leaves."
