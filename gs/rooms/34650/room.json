      "Secured by a smoked glass door, the lounge is an intimate space that smells faintly of tobacco and leather.   A number of cushioned leather seats sit opposite one another, separated by a smoked glass table with a frosted pattern at its edges that resembles interlocking talons.  Within reach of the table, a burled ash humidor holds cigars and matches."
