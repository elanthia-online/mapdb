      "Curved coral walls enclose the shop, with male mannequins standing motionless between sculpted stone columns.  Their exposed surfaces are rough with time and growth.  Nets drift loosely from the ceiling, edges caught on jagged coral outcrops.  The floor shifts in texture where reef meets smooth worn rock, marked by faint trails and indentations.  A curtain of woven seagrass hangs near the back, strands swaying in slow, steady motions."
