      "The moon is rarely given substantial opportunity to peek through the persistant cloud cover, but when the moment arises and the distant lake's surface is pierced, thousands of miniscule pinpoints of light are projected along the ground, twinkling and shimmering like brilliant stars in a clear night sky.  Smaller rocks and piles of rubble take a secondary position to much larger boulders, and reliance on a pre-cleared trail becomes necessary, as deviation from the pathway becomes treacherous and unreliable."
