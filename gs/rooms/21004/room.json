    "description": [
      "Thick foliage, dotted with exotic flowers ranging in hue from vibrant white to intense oranges and purples, covers the majority of the richly soiled ground.  Extending far above the dense carpet of moss, a mass of trees forms the imposing walls of the jungle, and the towering canopy of their widely spread leaves only enhances the darkness of night.  The distant murmur of a river is occasionally heard amongst the chirping of crickets and the rustling of leaves as nocturnal creatures roam their domain."
