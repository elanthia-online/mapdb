      "The daunting austerity of this large chamber seems to demand quiet and civility.  A large, golden-edged kite shield bearing the House coat-of-arms is fixed to the wall immediately behind a large silver-grey full moon table surrounded by some high-backed polished leather chairs.  Two rows of long oak benches line the walls.  A polished gold chandelier hangs from the center of the vaulted ceiling which arcs high overhead in a circular dome supported by curved white-washed beams."
