      "Four hanging moons of colored glass hang from the overhead, lit from within to cast their commingled light on the shop foyer.  Statues, one dark and one pale, guard a trio of archways that lead off to the northeast, southeast, and east.  At the feet of each effigy sits a bowl holding a burning stick of incense, the heavy scent of which thickens the air.",
