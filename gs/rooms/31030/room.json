      "Rows of planters line the concourse, each brimming with brightly colored plants surrounded by broad leaves, while elegant brass sconces cast a soothing light upon the smooth, onyx-swirled white marble floors and walls.  A golden arch rests next to a frosted window proclaiming \"Two of a Kind\" opposite a rounded arch next to a plaque that ascribes its entry to \"Calm, Cool, Scented, I'm Yours.\""
