      "A sprawling cavern unfolds beyond a pair of white marble double doors, harboring numerous stone structures amid a network of walkways.  Row upon row of neatly tended giant luminescent toadstools enclose the courtyard and at the heart of the open space, a bed of soft, bluish moss lies at the base of a brilliant silvery marble monolith.  Interspersed between the glowing fungi are a few polished iron statues of warriors in various battle poses."
