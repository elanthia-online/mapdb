      "A split rail fence guards the cliff-shorn side of the path, and its wooden beams are darkened with age and use, though appear sturdy enough.  Vines twist along its length, emerald green and dotted with trumpet-shaped coral-hued flowers clustered atop fans of heart-shaped leaves.  The perfume in the air is less fruit and more floral here, sweet with the slightest hint of bitterness beneath."
