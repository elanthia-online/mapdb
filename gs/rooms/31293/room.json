      "This open-air stall is made from long cocobolo limbs lashed together with sinew.  A thatched roof of jungle ferns keeps the elements at bay.  Centered in the space are two straw mannequins decked out in handmade finery.  The female mannequin is facing the male mannequin, while between them a small table holds several more items for sale.  A reed curtain leads to another room."
