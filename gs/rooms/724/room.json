      "Meandering along the edge of the cliffs, the gaer provides secure footing despite its narrowness.  Set just off the pathway is a three-sided glaes scholar statue.  Bits of shrubbery have grown up about the figure encircling its form.  The view is magnificent, covering the Gyldemar Forest to the east all the way to the Black Forest far southward."
