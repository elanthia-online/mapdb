      "A stone rail accented with brilliant topazes leads back upward to the well-lit entry of the shop.  Scattered into a dark corner is a heap of weapons accented with dark jewels.  Painted overhead is a silver crescent moon outlined with black sapphires of assorted shapes and sizes.  A decaying rope hooked into the wall offers guidance deeper into the darkness."
