      "Stairsteps descend and ascend along the inward facing wall of the room, their dark blue wood in contrast to the light blue-green of the walls and marble floors.  The northern walkway and the western walkway lead off to other chambers on the outward side of the tower.  A few overstuffed chairs covered in garish sealife prints sit around a low table inset with a coral and mother-of-pearl pattern on its legs."
