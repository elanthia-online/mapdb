      "Shelves line the right side of the room from floor to ceiling; some are lined with half-opened cards, while others have some sculpted glass vases upon them that hold an assortment of quills and styli.  The wall straight ahead has a mural of colored tiles resembling a waterfall and has been framed with stacks of colored paper and parchments.  A set of stairs that leads to the floor above is against the left corner of the room, while the remaining wall has bouquets of various flowers hanging upside down to dry."
