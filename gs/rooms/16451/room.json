      "Rounded walls fitted with floor to ceiling windows are draped with pale silk curtains to give the lounge a soothing, airy feel that is only accented by the spacious placement of the furnishings.  Low tables are set with refreshments and surrounded by a couple of ebonwood divans that promote social circles, while round bamboo chairs are set at the edges of the room for those that wish the space for solitary repose."
