      "Numerous displays highlight a variety of ships and ship customizations, presumably available in this brightly lit and pristine shop.  An entire wall is devoted to ships in glass bottles interspersed with antique sailing flags, and a large teak counter holds a single candle, its strong citrus scent dispelling the more pungent odors coming from the pier outside."
