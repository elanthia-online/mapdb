      "A cream-colored marble fountain marks the end of the cloistered walk to the east.  Beds of wild rose have been planted in a circle around the base, perfuming the air with their sweetness.  The vividly red blossoms contrast starkly with the dusting of snow on the leaves, but despite the chill, the bushes thrive and the water of the fountain echoes merrily off of the stones of the nearby walk."
