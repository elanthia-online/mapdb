      "This room appears to be a cavern hewn from dark gray stone with white ora veins.  A rocking chair sits in front of a cleverly carved niche in the stone wall that serves as a fireplace.  The sparse furnishings include a neatly made bed covered with a grey and red blanket, and a large table holding various chemicals and potions neatly stored in jars and flasks.  A shelf on the wall holds scrolls, tomes and writing implements, including a grey tome and a black ledger labeled \"Twilight Hall Accounts.\""
