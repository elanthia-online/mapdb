      "An invar-banded gate rests in a half-opened position, at the ready to barricade the settlement against the wild denizens of Teras Isle.  Opposite the gate, a raised invar portcullis serves as the second line of defense, its sharp tines held in position above the cobblestone threshold leading into Kragnek Dzu."
