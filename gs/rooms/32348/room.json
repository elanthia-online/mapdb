      "So cold are the waters of the main that rings of ice have formed near the water line, putting out protrusions like jagged fangs.  The air is bitter cold and has an unsavory tang of too much brine upon it.  Hoarfrost climbs the pilings with silvery, grasping claws.",
      "The easternmost of the trio of piers is a mess of creaky planks spotted heavily with the droppings of seafowl.  Waters to either side are deep, black, and cold.  Stinging salt is so thick on the air as to have left cakes of gleaming grit on the nearby pylons."
