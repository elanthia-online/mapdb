      "Garlands of twine-strung leaves, acorns, and autumnal-hued scraps of cloth hang in a scalloped line high on the walls enclosing this section of the wagon, and a fan of woven straw accents each peak.  In the corners hang strands of alternating dried apple slices and cinnamon sticks, and an amber-beaded curtain shields the further reaches of the wagon from view."
