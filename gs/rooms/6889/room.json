      "Thick wooden timbers shore the walls and ceiling up, unbothered by time.  A sturdy wooden table sits in the center of the room, its positioning providing a good view down all of the wide tunnels surrounding it.  The remains of a deck of cards are scattered over the floor, and old weaponry leans against the walls.  Nearly unseen under the table is a small notebook."
