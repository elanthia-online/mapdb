      "It's shady and cool beneath the drawbridge.  The Tempest River, though swift in the channel, chuckles slowly and cheerfully among the stones and alluvium along the bank.  Reeds, cattails, tall river grasses, and other various weeds flourish in the rich mud and silt.  Set off to the side of the drawbridge is a rickety shack with a cast iron fish set into the ground in front of it.",
