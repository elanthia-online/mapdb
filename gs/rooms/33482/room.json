      "A tattered merchant permit hangs on one of the ribbed black willow walls, and a vaulted ceiling rises overhead.  A bronze peg-legged cat statue sits in one corner of a dark-stained oak floor.  There is a narrow glass-topped table on one side of the shop and an elegant silver jewelry rack on the other."
