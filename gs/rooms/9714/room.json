      "High in the branches of the oak, the thick growth of limbs, intersecting and crossing, offers an easy passageway between the trees.  The boughs are wide and easily traversed.  A break in the canopy overlooks a steep precipice, falling for hundreds of spans, its bottom lost in the haze of distance.",
      "High in the branches of the oak, the thick growth of limbs, intersecting and crossing, offers an easy passageway between the trees.  The boughs are wide and easily traversed, and the moonlight is brighter here.  A break in the canopy overlooks a steep precipice, falling for hundreds of spans, its bottom lost in the darkness."
