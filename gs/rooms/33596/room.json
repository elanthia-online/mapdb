      "Tall as a halfling, the yellow and green blades of grass rise in a perimeter around this small clearing, which is comprised of moss and packed dirt.  A tangled thicket of chokeberry briars occupies the western edge and stands as guardian over a large rabbit hole.  Dipping in and out of the clearing, a narrow track slowly ambles away from the area."
