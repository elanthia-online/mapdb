      "Hardy columns of mistwood are carved with a fanciful parade of various bugs and insect life.  Dark forest green silk blankets the space, creating flowing walls and a wavering peaked ceiling. Several vaalin lanterns are suspended from above, their soft glow illuminating the beige-carpeted ground below."
