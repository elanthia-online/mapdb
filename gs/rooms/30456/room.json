    "description": [
      "Glittering wetly in the moonlight from the constant coating of sea spray it endures, a large mast sticks upright from the water, the galleon it is attached to immersed beneath the ocean's shadowy surface.  Tattered sails hang limply from the spars, providing a convenient sleeping perch for puffins, gulls, and one giant albatross as they rest.  Barely visible just beneath the water, a gash in the ship's hull disappears into the night-black, watery depths."
