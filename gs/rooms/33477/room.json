      "A tattered merchant permit hangs on one of the whitewashed shiplap walls, and a rough-hewn post and beam ceiling rises overhead.  An intricate cloth mosaic tile rug sits in one corner of a wide plank pine floor.  There is an open cast iron safe inlaid with intricate brass scrollwork  on one side of the shop and an oak slab shelf supported by solid brass brackets on the other."
