      "The thin, stone ledge is marred by deep cracks and chips in its surface, the result of untold years of exposure to the thick mists of the underground falls and the heavy passage of unnumbered travelers.  Occasionally, a sliver of stone is knocked free from the ledge and tumbles down into the calm, gently lapping waters below."
