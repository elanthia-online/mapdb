      "Dark black cliffs march south in a long wall valiantly holding off the angry storm-blown sea of the eastern shore.  To the north, the brooding volcano rolls down into the sea, its sides marred by the streaks of lava flows seen from afar.  Some are little more than smudges of soot and fantastic rock formations, others still crawl and hiss their way unwillingly into the breakers."
