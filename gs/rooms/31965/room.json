      "Two wooden tables create an \"L\" shape in the northeastern corner of the room.  The surfaces seeped in a viscous, black ichor that emits a putrid stench in the air.  Half-taxidermied animals are strewn across the room, their pelts molding away in patches that expose the skeletal frame beneath.  A large statue of a grizzly bear standing on its hind legs stands eight feet tall near the table with a claw holding onto a basket."
