      "Crystal droplets, pendants, and beads draped over an elaborate gold leaf frame create a dazzling display of illumination in the grand stairwell of the hotel.  Framed by gilded railings on both sides, the centerpiece is a sweeping, curved staircase, clad in polished mahogany and adorned with a crimson carpet featuring gold floral motifs.  A dried garland of purplish black hissing ivy and midnight belladonna cascades down each banister, filling the air with a sweet, yet acrid, fragrance."
