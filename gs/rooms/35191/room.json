      "Three walls of soot-stained brick enclose an angular workspace inside this stout building, clearly partitioned from the rest of the structure by a long, interior wall.  Dwarves work over a row of anvils stationed around a brick firepit, hammering away at glowing hot metal in their tongs before dousing the finished blades in a trough of green-tinged liquid.  A pitted green metal rack is mounted to the longer of two exterior walls, while an acid-stained table resides against the shorter, adjacent to a reinforced door leading out."
