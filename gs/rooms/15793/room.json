      "The view to the south is dominated by the great temple of Icemule Trace, which bathes the Temple Burrow in silvery light as the moon's beams refract through cut ice.  At this late hour, only a few temple monks move through the streets in the service of their own patron gods.",
      "The view to the south is dominated by the great temple of Icemule Trace, which bathes the Temple Burrow in bands of color as sunlight refracts through cut ice.  Even from this height, the bustle of pilgrims to and fro fills the streets with the quiet murmur of prayer."
