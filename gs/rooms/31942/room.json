      "Organically terraced by jagged, layered shale protrusions, the earth climbs northerly in a steep acclivity.  Brightly flowered groundcover blankets the treacherous terrain, their roots forcefully emerging from between the sheets of sedimentary rock.  Trimmed in an invar-braced marble arch, a fissure rends one of the short cliffs.  Under the meager shade offered by sparsely leaved trees, the asperous road, fraught with gaping cracks, picks a strategic path through the multitudinous hazards."
