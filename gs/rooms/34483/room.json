      "Crescent-shaped, the alcove has exposed dark mahogany rafters that support a ceiling of glossy golden linden planks.  Pendant-shaped lanterns dangle over the space, spreading an even illumination that aids those working nearby.  An orb-shaped cobblestone fireplace keeps the chill of arctic winds at bay, while grey suede chairs and small tables are arranged in social circles for the comfort of those working."
