      "Here in the back corner of the pavilion a makeshift station has been set up to wash, dirty, curl, straighten, braid, loosen, and otherwise fuss with all kinds of hair.  Jumbled together in a crate are bottles of olive oil, combs, ribbons and pins.  Wood-handled irons are propped over a small fire pit, and the smoke has started to fill the enclosed space."
