      "Massive trees frame the river cutting its way through the jungle, their limbs laden with a dense canopy of leaves and creeping vines that is permeated with hazy shafts of moonlight.  The riverbed gradually gives way to moss-covered ground, and shadows dance across the rich soil to create brief, insubstantial images.  The dampness infused into the air from the river accentuates the ever-present mist overlaying the island, leaving a glistening dew upon everything it touches.",
      "Trees densely covered in leaves and creeping vines surround the river as it meanders through the thickening jungle.  The riverbed of rocks gradually gives way to passable travel along either side of the foamy water, and the dampness infused into the air accentuates the ever-present mist overlaying the island.  An occasional flash of silver can be seen within the river as fish traverse its depths."
