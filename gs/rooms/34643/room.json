      "Grim, armed figures in dark garb patrol the battlements overhead, but judging from the glowing wards scribed on the foreboding walls, they are far from the sole defense of the citadel at the town's heart.  Clustered along the wall is a stand of thriving poisonwood trees with nettle and nightshade growing at their bases.  To the southeast, the slate-roofed buildings of the Hushed Span linger in characteristic quiet."
