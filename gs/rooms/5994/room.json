      "A dusty clearing opens along the hillside, its dry earth imbedded with a few rocky remnants of what was once a graveled road leading up to the hilltop.  Yellow meadow grasses grow abundantly along the edges of the clearing, covering the hill in a sea of swaying blades.  A timber archway, guarded by a hefty iron-banded gate, provides passage to the summit."
