      "Large arched windows cover the entire expanse of the far wall, shrouded in curtains of heavy linen, dimming the room.  Plain stone tables have been placed at regular intervals across the tiled stone floor, each bearing a cylindrical glass lamp that casts ample light over the workspace.  Either side of the room bears floor-to-ceiling bookshelves, each holding dusty tomes and well-worn scrolls.  Despite the guild members that study here, the library retains an air of reverent silence."
