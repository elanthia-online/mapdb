      "Under the falls, the water is turbulent and deep, becoming calmer further in.  Lily pads torn from their mooring along the edges of the pool float freely, some with blossoms tightly closed to the night and often holding the occasional small green frog.  Large enough to hold multiple people comfortably, a rock bathed in moonlight rises from the depths of the pool.",
      "Under the falls, the water is turbulent and deep, becoming calmer further in.  Lily pads torn from their mooring along the edges of the pool float freely, some still blossoming with pale pink, white, and the rare crimson blooms, often holding the occasional small green frog.  Large enough to hold multiple people comfortably, a sun-warmed rock rises from the depths of the pool."
