      "Rambling through the sunlit garden, a grey stone path ends at the pond's bank, which is bordered with lush azalea, water lillies, multi-hued wisteria, and bamboo trees.  Soft colors line the deep blue water, as garden hues mesh on the reflective surface.  Ensconced by purple and ivory water lilies, floating lily pads blanket the perimeter, and tiny green frogs lightly skip from one padded perch to another.  A small dock bordered with weeping willows juts over one edge."
