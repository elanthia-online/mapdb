      "Four support posts rise perfectly straight in the air to support the heavy canvas of pavilion, while the opposite ends are weighted with enormous wrought iron circles.  Hooks hammered into their lengths are fitted with bronze chains that hold large braziers aloft, the sturdy round bowls filled with coals that illuminate every corner of the space.  Long tables filled with wares are arranged to create alleys that lead to other sections of the pavilion, while river reed baskets are tidily tucked beneath them."
