      "Jagged shale tilts precipitously toward a sheer drop to the northwest, the ground's surface scored and scratched by great claw marks.  Fetid water seeps through hairline cracks in the black rock ridge to the south, pooling in shallow hollows slick with algae.  Above, scattered palms sway, their bark festooned with crude bone fetishes and smeared with white splotches."
