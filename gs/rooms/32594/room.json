      "The cramped quarters of this small shop are made to seem even smaller by the inclusion of several half-body mannequins modeling wares and mounted to the upper walls above various shelves and display tables.  Armless and legless, the torsos pitch just a bit forward, looming and held in place with rope and rigging that looks suspiciously like a sailor is responsible for the knots.  At the rear of the shop is a short counter, scarred and discolored with age, scattered with knickknacks."
