      "Polished rails of golden linden ring the balcony and follow the length of the catwalk as it traverses the open air towards a large tree.  Trailing dog rose vines, their bright pink blooms perfuming the air, decorate the walls of the inn and create delicate wreaths over the white birch and mahogany doors."
