      "Wind-carved posts rise on either side of the path where the grasslands narrow into the village's edge, their tops hung with trailing sea buckthorn, rawhide strips, and knotted cords that flutter high above the swaying grasses.  Clusters of sea buckthorn grow at the bases of the posts, their thorny branches thick with narrow leaves and bright orange berries.  Beyond the markers, the path broadens among the first scattered gers."
