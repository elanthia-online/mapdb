      "The black marble floor is polished to a high sheen, in contrast with the pearl grey granite columns lining the room.  Four archways lead to different wings of the Gallery.  Bare spots, with slightly brighter paint than the rest of the wall, indicate where items have been removed from above three of the arches.  The graven image of a female human face hangs over the last arch."
