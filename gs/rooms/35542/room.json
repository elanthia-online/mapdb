      "Beyond the porthole-pierced door, an enormous lattice of alabaster whale ribs forms the walls of this ramshackle eatery.  A sunken white rowboat houses a barnacle-bedizened till near its prow, with salvaged driftwood planks lashed inside serving as a makeshift counter.  Ochre-painted ship's wheels are scattered randomly about the room, serving as tables, with small oaken barrels for seating.  Scallop shell lanterns dangle above each, their interiors aglow with the trapped shimmer of phosphorescent plankton."
