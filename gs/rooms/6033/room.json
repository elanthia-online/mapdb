      "The battle between farmer and nature is quite evident in this portion of the turnip patch.  Weeds grow abundantly among the turnips near the boulder to the southeast, clustering around the outnumbered turnip plants.  Just to the northwest, someone has taken a hoe to the weeds that infested several of the turnip rows.  These weeds are now dead, their roots exposed and their stems and leaves shriveled.  It is a constant battle to see if the hoe will be faster than the weed."
