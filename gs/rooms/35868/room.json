      "Masterfully carved cobblestones are aligned in opposing spirals, their roughly textured surfaces and contrasting hues contributing to the artfully detailed masonry.  Armored and uniformed dwarves stand guard in parapets on the granite wall to either side of a raised gleaming invar portcullis, the settlement's only defensible entryway.  A magnificent fountain splashes noisily to the east in the center of a concave plaza."
