      "Crisp sea spray explodes into the air as rhythmic ocean waves meet large boulders dotting the small, shadowy expanse of beach.  Rushing up the sand, the salty water races to refresh densely packed pools gathered in the many nooks and crannies almost obscured by the night shadows near the base of the cliffs.  Moonlight glistens on the green algae and yellowing seaweed covering much of the slick steps climbing haphazardly up the cliff-face.",

Rushing up the sand, the salty water races to refresh densely packed pools gathered in the many nooks and crannies found near the base of the cliffs.  Green algae and yellowing seaweed covers much of the exposed stone.  Climbing haphazardly up the cliff-face, slick steps have been eroded into the dense rock by years of exposure to the wind and sea."
