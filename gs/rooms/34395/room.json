      "From the modwir hardwood floors to the canvas-covered walls, the expansive room is a pet's wonderland filled with carpet-covered perches and towers to promote climbing and exploration.  A pet-friendly chaos of glittery balls and toys litter the floor, inviting inquisitive pet guests to play.  Plush silk pillows rest against the curved walls, a relaxation spot for pets and people alike.  Opposite a thick fir door, a tall cherrywood cabinet sits near a varnished mahogany door, a tiny pile of chewed rawhide next to it."
