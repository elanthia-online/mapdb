    "description": [
      "Completely surrounded by unnavigable boulders save a single moss-covered ramp with a precarious incline, this landing offers some shelter from what appears to be a high-precipitation area beyond.  Luxuriant vegetation rich with deep greens and patterned shrubbery paints a painting-perfect backdrop to this mud and stone-filled space around the natural embankment.  Painstakingly manicured to remove obstacles and unsightly overgrowth, the trail from the landing is precipitous but viable."
