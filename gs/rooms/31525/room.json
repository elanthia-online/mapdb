      "Short and squat, the dimly lit building has an air of antiquity about it that is enhanced by the smell of dust and pipe tobacco.  Floor-to-ceiling shelves filled with all manner of wares block the windows, causing the sunlight to peek from behind the wooden structures.  Despite the cramped walls, the center of the shop is bare except for a short glass-topped counter and a cormorant-inked ironwood door nestled in the farthest corner of the room."
