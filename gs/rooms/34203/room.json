      "Winding through a bulge in the tunnel wall, a fine crack in the stone spits moist, hot air and a fine spray of water, periodically hissing and overlaying the scent of sulfur on the dankness of ruptured earth.  Water drips from a slight overhang below the crack, plinking loudly into a furrow in the stone below.  The resulting runnel splits and splits again, spreading through the scraped rock and turning it glossy and black."
