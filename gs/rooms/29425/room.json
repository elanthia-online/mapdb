      "Rich sapphire wool hangs from the white oak frame of this spacious pavilion.  A chandelier set with frosted globes hangs from the peaked ceiling, each orb etched with a blooming rose.  Soft ivory velvet drapes frame an archway that leads deeper into the shop, while matching wool carpeting underfoot muffles all sound.  A dark iron rack filled with elegant gowns is displayed in the center of the space."
