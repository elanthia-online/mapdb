      "A giant tiered platform rises from the center of the floor, watched over by the pale stalactites that loom above.  Massive crystals jut out from the rocky walls of the subterranean area, the source of the unique acoustic qualities of the cavern.  They resonate with a low thrum, the result of absorbing the noise of training and instruction.  Simple archways run along the entire perimeter, leading to private guild training areas."
