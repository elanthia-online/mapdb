      "Evocative of wispy parasols, towering flowers shelter the narrow trail, globules of dew gracing their cerulean-limned, emerald ray florets.  Overgrown lilies thrive in the dappled shade, their sprawling, jewel-toned blooms bespeckling the landscape with saturated coloration.  Adding hints of vibrant foliage, heart-shaped wild ginger peeks out from around the blossoms."
