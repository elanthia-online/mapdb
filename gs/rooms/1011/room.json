    "description": [
      "If mining could be called an art, this tunnel may be as close as it gets.  A perfectly flat granite floor, its surface roughened just a little for traction, leads off to the southeast.  The walls follow, their sides unerringly vertical and neither moving together nor widening out.  The ceiling is a flat, smoothly chiseled expanse of grey granite.  Thick beams set the same exact distance apart all the way down the tunnel support the walls and ceiling."
