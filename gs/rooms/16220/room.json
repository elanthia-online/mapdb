      "[Fleet Captain's Dock]"
    ],
    "description": [
      "This wooden dock rests firmly on a half-dozen ancient, black stone pilings.  Although covered with barnacles and knots of mussels, it's still apparent that the pilings are fluted like the pillars of an old temple.  On either side of the dock the banks of the creek are thick with reeds and cattails.  The tidal creek flows by sluggishly."
