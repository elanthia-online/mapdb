      "Moonlight filters through the coconut sail draped across the trellis, casting faint shadows onto the terracotta tiles below.  Lines of white plaster between the tiles glow softly, leading to a sunken seating area at the heart of the space.  Wooden benches of kermes oak encircle the area, their carvings merely shadows in the dark.  Cushions in deep chartreuse and olive green take on muted tones, blending with the polished wood.  The white walls glow faintly, while the teal double doors deepen into shadowy hues."
