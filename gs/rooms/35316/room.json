      "Mahogany counters arranged side-to-side form a horseshoe shape at the center of the space, their high sides intricately carved with repeating kraken motifs.  Beyond, a large, circular mural depicts azure and indigo waters with frothy white waves where the many tentacles of a kraken emerges from the depths.  Pendant lanterns of blended sea glass and black iron shed their wavering light upon coastal-themed artwork that hangs on the walls between the booths and the lobby beyond."
