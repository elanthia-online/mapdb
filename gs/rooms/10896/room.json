      "Stark whitewashed plaster walls are somewhat softened by darkly stained wood chair railings which surround the room.  There is a beautiful antique desk at one end of the room with a large polished brass ship's bell standing to its right side.  Several benches are provided for those with an interest in the legal proceedings of this small town.  Those coming before the Admiral do not have the luxury of being seated however."
