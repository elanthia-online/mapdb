      "Bookcases, stacked to overflowing with tomes and scrolls and other readables, fill this large room.  The air smells of the pleasant must only present in libraries, but no dust collects on the carefully maintained shelves.  Protected lanterns hang at regular intervals from the ceiling, shedding plenty of light to read by.  A carved wooden sign hangs just before the door."
