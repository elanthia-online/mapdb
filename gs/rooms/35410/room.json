      "Pale wood forms the kiosk's frame, its surface sanded smooth where knots and grain swirl in quiet patterns.  A simple awning of woven flax stretches overhead, its edges stitched with geometric borders.  Neatly folded blankets rest upon a counter, their vibrant hues spilling across the pale surface.  Hanging from wooden pegs, shawls and cloaks drape in layered cascades, their fringed hems shifting as air moves through the passage.  Beneath the counter, small baskets house bolts of fabric."
