      "Driftwood-encircled drawings of various aquatic life frame the wood-planked walls of the shop, the colorful renderings connected to one another by thread-like lengths of fishing line dangling lures and various charms.  A hempen rope-latticed wall obscures the expansive circular window at the back of the room, the woven netting weighted down by a pair of comically posed otters carved from dark walnut."
