    "description": [
      "In this peaceful loft, great mounds of sweet-smelling hay are piled high, awaiting hungry oxen fresh off the trail.  It brings to mind idyllic thoughts of lazy afternoons spent lying in the hay, listening to the nicker of horses from below.  With a rustle of wings, a startled barn owl takes flight and soars to another, quieter part of the barn, where it settles down to its slumber once again."
