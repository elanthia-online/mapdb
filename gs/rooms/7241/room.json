      "This room is low roofed and very cramped.  It is stuffed full of ancient clothing, unsalvagable armor, rotted backpacks, battered chests and many more things you cannot even identify.  Time, damp and vermin have taken their toll here.  Nothing in the form of serviceable plunder is apparent in this stuffy, closet-like anteroom."
