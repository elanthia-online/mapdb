      "Varnished with crushed black coral to give purchase, the oak and teak catwalk gleams in the ambient light.  A glass and oak building and a teak and polished oak shop face one another on either side of the catwalk, each on several sturdy support posts sunk deep into the harbor.  A wide ramp leads down and away from the catwalk, while to the south, a large docking structure with ample portage is visible."
