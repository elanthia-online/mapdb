      "Strings of quartz crystals weigh down the chaotically colorful fabric ceiling, their facets scattering light that glints off precious stones in a rich mahogany jewelry display lined with worn blue velvet.  To the northeast, a pair of potted pale sage lace ferns frame a glossy ebony buffet with a missing door that backs against a wall of heavy curtains.  On its black granite top with a spiderweb of cracks are jars of broken jewelry, boxes of mismatched beads, and a partially polished copper tin."
