      "A carved, wooden dragon has been nailed to the center of this otherwise unadorned oval table.  The dragon is perched on a small rock outcropping, surveying the surrounding area.  The carving is so poorly done that the dragon is only barely identifiable.  Wooden chairs sized for all races surround the table."
