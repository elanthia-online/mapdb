      "Cracked foundations are all that remain of single-room homes that once stood upon this sandy shore.  Splintered, warped, and shattered floorboards fill the rough square shapes, though the wooden lengths are waterlogged and riddled with barnacles.  To the northwest, large poles hint that a pier may once have stood there, but the timbers that allowed passage and access long ago rotted away.",
      "A scattering of single-room homes have been erected along the sandy shore, their planks painted in a myriad of colorful tones and adorned with shells and bits of driftwood.  Large wooden poles, wrapped in a lattice of sun-bleached cotton ribbons, provide a foundation for a half-built pier, the remaining materials neatly stacked safely away from the day-to-day hustle of the residents.  The aroma of fish and vegetables emanates from one of the open windows, combining with the brininess of the oceanic air."
