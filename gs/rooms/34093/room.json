      "Spacious and tidy, the floor of the living space is fashioned of polished oak and covered with a herringbone woven bamboo mat edged by a plaited band of natural sea grass rush.  Colorful artwork decorates one beadboard wall, the pieces hanging above a copious amount of bamboo barstools featuring plush rattan-backed seats flanked by a thatch-roofed tropical bamboo bar surrounded by a plethora of vibrant flora.  Near the open archway to the kitchen, a modest cocobolo writing desk and cocobolo bench rest beneath a copper lantern, while in the opposite corner a ladder leads to the second floor near the open door."
