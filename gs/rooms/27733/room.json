      "Off in the distance lie the high Ice Plains behind their sturdy rolaren gate.  In the opposite direction stands the impressive structure of Silverwood Manor.  The wall itself is empty except for the ubiquitous snow and ice, which seems determined to claim the structure as its own.",
      "Both sides of the wall are similarly cloaked in darkness.  On the city side, the nearest visible lights come from Silverwood Manor on Cursed Street, almost in the center of town.  The winds howl down the near empty walls, filling the night with a mournful chill."
