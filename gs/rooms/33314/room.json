      "Gaps in the paneling of the drafty shop allow beams of sunlight to pierce the shadow-draped room.  Save for the space in front of the ebonwood door, the floor is covered by a shaggy, violet alpaca wool carpet, on which rests an open damask-lined valise housing a few knickknacks.  Centered prominently in the circular space, a heavy wrought iron garment rack towers, its spokelike arms extending to nearly touch the walls."
