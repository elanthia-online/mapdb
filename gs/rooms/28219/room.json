    "description": [
      "Square in shape, the vestibule is bathed in a shaft of muted gold sunlight streaming through the open top section of the front door.  A richly carved staircase rises from the terracotta-tiled floor, cantilevered against the four walls to provide a perfect viewing platform for the irregularly shaped table that dominates the center of the room.  Mismatched cabinets and battered trunks fill the asymmetrical spaces beneath the stairway, crammed with assorted timekeeping devices and navigational instruments."
