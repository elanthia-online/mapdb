      "Interminably tall obsidian cliffs rise sentry-like to the west.  Charl's Teeth, as they have been named by the inhabitants, rise dark, sharp and uncompromising.  Glistening with moisture, ridged and creviced with pointed peaks positioned at every angle, the rocky outcropping accepts the slap of the easterly current-fed waters as its due, standing unfazed as those animated waves touch and bow and scrape in homage to the sheer power of the glossy, black crags."
