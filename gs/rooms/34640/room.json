      "Multicolored light bleeds in cool hues from warding glyphs etched into the surface of the grim basalt walls defending the Bastion's base.  As if oblivious to the imposing battlements above, patches of mournbloom and bleeding heart flourish in cultivated banks at the base of the wall.  The air is cold, as if the shadow of the great spire above has leached the warmth from the surroundings."
