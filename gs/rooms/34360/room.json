      "White clouds of steam rise up from the lake where the water has been superheated by the violent strikes of the storm.  The result is a dense fog that carries the scent of ozone.  A softly glowing hemisphere of bright white zorchar rests on the ground, perfectly aligned with one of the obsidian spires of the large ring at the center of the island."
