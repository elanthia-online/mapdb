      "The meadow's southernmost verge provides a dazzling view of the Frostmain.  Dotted with stony islands, the grey expanse of water sprawls out in a frigid panorama that stretches as far as the eye can see.  Contrasted with the tenebrous hues of the sea, the meadow is alive with green grasses and bright flowers in sunny golds and startling violets."
