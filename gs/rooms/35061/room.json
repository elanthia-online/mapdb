      "Dilipidated pillars, denuded of the artworks they once held, shelter along the far wall of the marketplace.  Vibrant banners hang from stone arches and flap in the cold wind, casting patterns of dancing shadow over the colorful stalls that occupy the niche.  The bazaar thrives and seethes with its newfound purpose, though dark grace notes of its history manifest in the broken chains riveted to the walls and the blocks spaced along the walkway."
