      "Plush white carpeting covers the floor of this wintry room, its surface reminiscent of snowfall.  Crystals carved into the shape of snowflakes hang at all lengths from the white-paneled ceiling.  A pristine white table sits in the center of the room, draped in a cover of pale blue brocade.  Wide armchairs surround the table, their plush seats covered in matching fabric.  Paintings of native arctic animals line the walls, their canvasses framed in gilt edged white wood."
