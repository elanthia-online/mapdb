      "Crates and barrels occupy one section of the pier; the piles are tidily stacked and bound together by small-weave hempen fishing nets and tied to the nearest piling.  Signs of a fire mar the posts, though only a few show signs of heavy damage along their tops.  Copper-hitching cleats glisten in the starlight light from along the edges of the decking."
