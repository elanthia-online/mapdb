      "Bright yellow flowers grow in the jungle canopy overhead.  The lower branches of the trees droop menacingly above the overgrown pathway, their pliant leaves swaying in the breeze.  Ferns grow in profusion in and around the path.  A few large stones, covered with reddish mosses, peek through the ferns."
