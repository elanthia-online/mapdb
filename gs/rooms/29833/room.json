      "Utilizing nearby pine and cedar trees for support, a canvas awning is strapped to the arbors to form a ceiling for the airy shop.  Blue, green, red, and brown panels are tacked to the ground and around the trees used to anchor the roof to give the displays a unique trapezoidal shape, while the gap between panels makes it breezy.  Display racks, barrels, crates, and a series of rough haon pegs house the various wares, which are carefully watched over by the broody proprietor."
