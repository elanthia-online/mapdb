    "description": [
      "Intense cold embitters the air of the expansive larder, a basement dug into the earth beneath the castle and surrounded by imposing walls of black rock.  The carcasses hanging from the low ceiling are still but untouched by rot, the subterranean frigidity helping keep decay at bay.  One corpse looks to have been bipedal.  Several barrels of brined fish in one corner lend a salty aroma that keeps the air sharply fresh."
