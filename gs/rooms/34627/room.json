      "Old brownstone homes with ivy-strangled walls stand as silent judges along the roadside, their quiet watchfulness contrasting sharply with the bedlam of the marketplace to the northwest.  The lane is a broad and even march of squared paving stones that are neatly fitted together.  Weeping willows stoop to either side, standing tall between scriveners' shops and booksellers."
