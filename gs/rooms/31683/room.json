      "Stacked along an out-of-the-way bench are a plethora of wooden fruit baskets, one nestled inside the other, some stained from extensive use while others are pristine, and running parallel to the bench is row after row of trees.  Apple trees, walnut trees, and pecan trees stretch in neat lines to the crest of the ridge, where the golden red light from beyond spills over and down the trunk-bordered lanes."
