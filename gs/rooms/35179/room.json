      "Much of this birch-paneled room is taken up by a brass-hinged display case, the contents arranged carefully on each shelf.  Tucked into one corner, its lid open wide, is a squat box crafted from interlinked bronze and birch panels.  The wooden floors are meticulously clean, though the faint smell of cooked meat and blood lingers in the air."
