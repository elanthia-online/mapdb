      "In the chamber's center, a large stone sculpture is suspended parallel to the floor and about four feet above it.  The statue depicts a humanoid female clutching at the hem of her tunic, bringing it up to hide her face.  The smooth curves of her bared legs and the folds of her garment are still unmarred, but her head and upper torso have been disfigured and reduced to hammered stone.  Squatting beneath the statue, a pair of elven gentlemen wearing false beards and loincloths hammer busily at its bosom."
