      "The moonlight begins to fall away to the northwest as the path slopes downward and the branches and leaves of the trees close overhead, blocking out the sky.  To the southeast, the woods open up and animals scurry in and out of the underbrush.  The temperature seems to drop down the slope to the northwest.",
