      "Standing alone within a wasteland of tumbled rocks and thick clumps of moss is an enormous banyan tree reaching toward the sky.  Thick roots, resembling the legs of an enormous spider, rise out of the soft, muddy ground and create arches that encircle the smooth barked monstrosity.  High in the tangled canopy are several enormous nests, their ragged edges cluttered with vulture feathers and rodent bones."
