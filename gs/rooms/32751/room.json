      "This room is brightly decorated with summery primary colors.  A plush red carpet with a dark blue border covers the floor, coordinating the blue and white striped curtains and deep red walls.  The large four-post bed features oversized yellow pillows above an elaborately embroidered comforter.  An elegant crystal vase on each night table holds a small bouquet of red roses."
