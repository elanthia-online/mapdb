      "An elaborate railing encloses the deck of the ship, and every inch of the vessel's timber construction has been polished to a high, flawless sheen.  Overhead, the mast balances the bundled weight of the striped buff and ultramarine sails, while a simple banner of the same colors flies over the crow's nest.  Set into the face of the upper deck, under the watch of the ship's wheel, is a sturdy round-windowed door leading down below."
