      "Large windows covering the east and west walls of the Great Hall stand open to catch the salt-scented breeze blowing in off the Bay.  The beaded ceiling above is rich-toned teak, and ceiling fans suspended from it turn at a lazy pace.  On the floor, woven rugs cover slate tiles, and piles of patterned pillows lie here and there for seating, each grouping of cushions accompanied by low teak tables."
