      "Pale sandstone cliffs encircle the valley floor, plumed with a crown of trees running along the ridgeway.  Trails and ledges climb down the steep slopes, dotted with thick clumps of tenacious brush that clings to the less than hospitable soil and provides a refuge for the local fauna.  Three waterfalls spill forth, each more glorious than the next."
