      "Branches intertwine to form several large benches here, covered with moss and soft pillows.  There's just enough of a breeze to be refreshing, and the songs of the birds and the chattering of the animals that live in the tree provide soft background noise.  One branch, larger than the rest, arches off to the east.  A spiral staircase leads back down into the trunk of the tree, curving around a cunningly carved tangle of branches.",
