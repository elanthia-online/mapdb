      "Tall yellow-tipped blades of grass wave gently in the slight breeze, lending the wide clearing the illusion of being filled with water.  Roughly circular, the clearing is ringed with a border of tall birches and stout oaks which seem to form a dark enclosure around the swaying grasses.  A few isolated oaks emerge from the interior of the clearing, like rough islands in a softly undulating sea.",
