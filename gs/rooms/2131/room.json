    "description": [
      "A sloping wall of mixed cinders and ash rises sharply to the west.  Beyond its top, some one hundred or more man-heights above, a constant spire of smoke the color of dead men's teeth leaks into the night sky.  Too steep to climb easily, and too loose and treacherous to climb even with care and preparation, the giant cone marks the unassailable domain of the volcano's heart.",
