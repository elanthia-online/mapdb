      "The long rows of turnips course off to the northeast, southwest and southeast like dark grey ribbons laid over a mottled, light grey quilt.  Something seems to be amiss with many of the turnips in the nearby rows, though.  Something has taken large bites of out some of them.  Others are completely missing their leaves.  Some are merely uprooted, while others appear to have completely disappeared.  Rolton tracks are evident in the soft soil.",
