      "An underlying coral reef pokes up majestically through the clear green-blue water, its sheer size and scope providing unquestioned evidence of the danger of the sea here.  The coral is spiny and sharp, displaying its enormous height at various points as the slap of waves sporadically reveals some of its highest peaks from watery hiding."
