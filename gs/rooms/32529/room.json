      "A huge fanciful mural of two entwined figures hangs on one of the pink-tinged creamy silk walls, and a soaring sunrise-painted ceiling rises overhead.  A magnificent Oleani statue cradling gemstone orbs sits in one corner of a lustrous ivory marble floor.  There is a stepped gold hexagonal display on one side of the shop and a candle-lit draped shrine on the other."
