      "With the exception of the southern wall, the library is encircled by floor-to-ceiling bookcases laden with tomes, volumes, and manuals.  Chandeliers, evenly spaced throughout the ceiling, provide ample illuminations for those reclining on any of the many cushioned armchairs scattered about the space.  A lectern rests opposite the entry and is surrounded by storage chests and broad oak tables."
