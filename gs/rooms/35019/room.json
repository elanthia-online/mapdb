      "Sheltered by a bend in the surrounding hills, the small meadow is a thriving niche of greenery in a cruel and foreboding landscape.  Here and there, patches of snow dot the grasses, but for the most part, the sanctuary is shielded from the fury of the elements.  A small herd of steelhorn roltons take advantage of the sheltered greenery."
