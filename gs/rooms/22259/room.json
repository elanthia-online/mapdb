      "Carefully laid cobblestones form this narrow street, the tilework pleasantly complementing the wide expanse of greenery just off the path.  A few non-descript buildings along the east might be homes, the dwellings quite small and simple.  A pudgy black cat naps atop one of the rooftops, content to soak up the sun."
