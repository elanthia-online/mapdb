      "Shallow currents weave through a glade where soft sediment gives way to swaying grasses and scattered coral shelves.  At the center rises a towering aelvara tree, its spiraled trunk lifting a canopy of glowing tendrils above the reef.  Light pulses through kelp-like strands in shifting blues and greens, echoing movements in the surrounding water.  Sea anemones cluster near the base, while darting fish and drifting plankton fill the space with constant, fluid motion."
