      "The remains here consist of the dead bodies of a few small burrowing creatures and little else of apparent value.  Broken chests, torn hogsheads and gunny sacks, stiff goatskins filled with sour ale, some worm-eaten leatherbound books, and other everyday items that have long outlived their usefulness have been left behind here to rot."
