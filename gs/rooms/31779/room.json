      "Thick tendrils of indigo-colored mist writhe across the ground, wrapping themselves across the bamboo-spiked lanterns in front of a row of stilted driftwood homes battered by waves of black water lapping at the foundations.  The sky above the homes has been blanketed by sinuous kites of silk, the eel-shaped toys rising and diving across the horizon, while others lay broken across the lapping waters.  A mechanical toy frigatebird perched on a log of driftwood, opens and closes its mouth soundlessly."
