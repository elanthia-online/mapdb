      "Spacious and tidy, the floor of the living space is fashioned of polished oak and covered with a simple throw rug.  Colorful artwork decorates one beadboard wall, the pieces hanging above a wide couch flanked by a sturdy end table.  Near the open archway to the kitchen, a plain oak desk and wooden chair rest beneath a copper lantern, while in the opposite corner a ladder leads to the second floor near the closed door.",
