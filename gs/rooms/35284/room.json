      "Under a blanket of stars, azure waters shimmer across travertine terraces, forming cool pools that beckon passersby to visit for a nighttime dip.  Steam from the pools higher up the cliff forms a pale haze in the air that dances and sparkles as the starlight above twinkles.  Creating a cozy retreat, a cobalt blue sailcloth canopy arcs over a resting area illuminated by blown glass globes.  A solitary tamarisk tree, in full bloom, casts intricate shadows upon the starlight-illuminated travertine nearby with its twisted branches and looping roots."
