      "This section of the boardwalk is connected to the others across the way by a rope-strung bridge suspended over the sand overhung by a metal-lined painted wooden sign.  Overlapping pieces of dark linen combine to form a canopy that hangs from splintered wooden pillars, framing the area and largely blocking the sun.  Several lanterns are hung from these pillars, offering an alternative light source.  Ornamental rugs layered in squares are placed at the boardwalk's edges between driftwood crates of varying sizes, offering space for individual market stalls."
