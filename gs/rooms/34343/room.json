      "Streaks of blindingly white lightning illuminate the sky, bright against dark, rain-swollen clouds, and the scent of wet stone and ozone fills the air.  Raging thunder accompanies every brilliant flash, each deafening clap an assault.  Somehow, a contorted white birch has managed to weather the storm."
