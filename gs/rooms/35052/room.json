      "Dark basalt columns stretch to the high ceiling of the auction house's grand hall, twined with scenes of nautical warfare in gold leaf.  They march toward a pair of arched steel double doors occupying much of the far wall.  Spaced between the pilasters are several cases framed by adamantine-laced glass, each containing relics arranged atop a spill of cerulean velvet.  Hireswords, as heavily armed as they are implacable stand watch atop lofty balconies above."
