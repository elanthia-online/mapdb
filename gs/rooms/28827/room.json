      "A huge stalactite hangs over the northeastern portion of the plaza, its base heavily eroded by seeping, milky water that steams along its mossy length, dripping to form a cloudy pool on the stones underfoot.  Mushrooms, black and banded with vivid orange stripes, have sprung up in the runnel worn by the constantly dripping fluid."
