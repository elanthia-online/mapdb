      "A shingle-roofed stone well occupies this small corner of the square, a single wooden bucket hanging from the hand crank designed to lower it.  The upper edge of the stones are festooned with garlands of greenery and flowers, and a ring of multihued flower petals litter the ground in a complete halo around the well."
