    "description": [
      "The House gameroom is a slightly shabby room lit by stained-glass lanterns that dangle from the ceiling.  Varicolored light from them falls upon the rugs that cover the walls.  An assortment of scuffmarks and stains mar the otherwise interesting pattern of various squares of hardwoods that makes up the flooring here.  A billiard table occupies the center of the room, alabaster and marble balls racked on its surface.  Leather couches line two of the walls, along with a pair of coffee tables."
