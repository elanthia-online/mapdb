      "Gull cries fill the humid air as the gluttonous birds circle overhead, drawn by schools of fish in the clear waters around the dock.  The fish are tiny and glint like silver coins, and while a few have sought safety in the shadowed crevices of an ominous old statue beneath the waterline, most swim about, heedless of the danger awaiting them.  The birds' droppings are sprays of stark white against the time-silvered planks, and judging from their copious leavings, they are prolific hunters."
