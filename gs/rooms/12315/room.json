      "Cool breezes drift over the railings of the porch and carry with them the sweet scent of the flowers that bloom nearby.  White wicker couches and chairs are spread out in small, social circles upon the polished golden linden floor boards, their wide expanses laden with plump cushions.  Wind chimes crafted of sea glass reflect the sunlight into a myriad of rainbow hues that dance upon the whitewashed inn walls.",
