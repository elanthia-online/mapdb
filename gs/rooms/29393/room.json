      "Only glimpses of the white velvet shell of the tent can be seen beyond the jewel-toned flyrsilk swathes that drape from the willow supports overhead to enclose this area.  Fresh winter roses are set in crystalline bowls here and there on tables, lending their heady scent to the air, which is warmed by a smokeless brazier in the center of the floor.  A tiered display sits on one side of the curtained archway that leads further into the tent and a slender willow cloak rack sits on the other."
