      "Several slate blue glass-shaded lanterns hang from the supports in this rear section of the pavilion, shedding light that is both easy on the eyes and adequate for detailed work.  A round ebonwood worktable sits near the far wall with a matching ebonwood stool, while several dark grey velvet-cushioned chairs are arranged haphazardly in the space beyond.  Centrally stationed among the seating is a glass-shelved wrought iron cart."
