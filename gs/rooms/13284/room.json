      "Shades of red, from the lightest pink to the deepest carmine, cover every surface.  Red marble tiles cover the floor, nearly obscured by rows of display cases holding dyes in bottles ranging from a few ounces to a couple of gallons in size.  In front of each bottle, there is a small swatch of fabric dyed the color of the contents.  A massive orb glows the color of day from a knotted silk net tied to the ceiling."
