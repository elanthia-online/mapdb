      "A massive domed chamber of thick, crystalline shards stretches outward, while several etched arcane sigils form a pattern across the glass-like floor.  A huge obsidian obelisk floats, suspended in mid-air, its surface crawling with wisps of glowing energy.  Ribbons of ethereal light swim along the chamber, lazily coiling and twisting about."
