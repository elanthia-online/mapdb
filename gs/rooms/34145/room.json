    "description": [
      "Cradled amid a thick grove of aspen trees is a vast lake, its water a deep blue hue and rippling with the stiff breeze blowing in from the north.  A towering waterfall fills the lake from the east as the water cascades down from the Dragonspine snowmelt.  Meanwhile, a swift river exits the lake to the west, winding its way into the wilderness.  Slowly rotting away, an abandoned dock on the lake's shore bears testament that the area was perhaps once inhabited."
