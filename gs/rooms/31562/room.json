      "Multiple lanes converge upon the dappled cobblestones of the avenue, though one such pathway transitions into a bowed cobblestone bridge that disappears in a shroud of mist as it crosses the canal.  Verdigris-topped lanterns with colored glass panes illuminate the arch they are mounted from in an orange sheen, while a departing pathway is left to violet-sheened shadows.  Four peaks, each topped with a gable, dominate the multistory manor that overlooks the street."
