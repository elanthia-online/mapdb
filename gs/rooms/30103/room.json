      "Scattered about the area are bits of scrap metal, rusted and tilted in odd angles with pointed ends sticking out here and there.  Odd benches made from copper pipes bent at odd angles line the walls beneath additional piping leading to a heavy stove with an angry face painted on it.  A metal door leads back to the front of the shop."
