    "description": [
      "Combed and devoid of rocks, the beach stretches smoothly to the water, which gently laps at the shore in a series of slow, successive waves.  Large and small boulders, each painted bright white, creates a wall that keeps the encroaching jungle at bay, while a tall and wide bonfire in the center of the beach is surrounded by a ring of large stones.  Winding a sinuous trail through the foliage, a slender shell-lined pathway twines its way towards the distant villa."
