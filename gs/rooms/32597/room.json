      "From rustic riverstone walls hang several paintings of lushly forested landscapes, and handwoven rugs are scattered about the wood floor, their brightness adding splashes of color to the shop.  Behind the counter, out of reach of wandering hands, are shelves filled with vials and bottles and work tables covered with plants in various stages of preparation.  A leaf-painted piece of parchment hangs near the counter, and with each gentle stir of air, a new fragrance drifts across the shop."
