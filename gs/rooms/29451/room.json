      "Thin linen dyed in wide, alternating stripes of crimson and gold provides meager protection against the elements over a swept dirt floor scattered with battered wooden crates of varying sizes.  A nicked modwir weapon rack leans against the back wall next to a hay-packed barrel banded with rusted steel.  Sitting on a rough pine countertop is a glass-topped case fitted with brass hinges."
