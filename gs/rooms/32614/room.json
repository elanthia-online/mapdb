      "The walls of this simple shop are decorated with talismans and symbols of worship displayed on rows of small iron hooks.  Joined modwir counters block access to the walls, leaving just enough space behind them for a solemn green-robed pilgrim to wander between and attend to patrons who wish to make a purchase.  Hanging from the ceiling, a flickering lantern dangles from a rather ordinary iron chain."
