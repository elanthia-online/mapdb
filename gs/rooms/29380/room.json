      "The tent's ceiling slopes dramatically downward, ending at the point where a large spike holds the canvas firmly in the ground.  A lopsided workbench is covered with a layer of ash and dust, although the goods sitting upon it seem relatively clean.  Some long nails have been hammered into a large chunk of glaes-veined granite."
