    "description": [
      "Wreathed in steam from the hot spring that surrounds it, the small island is encircled by low holly bushes that are laden with bright red berries amid their verdant leaves.  Rhimar spacers set into the flagstone tiles promote the frost and snow that cling to the ground and lend the area an enchanted aspect.  A sumac gazebo rests at the center of the stonework, a brightly burning brazier housed within offering the promise of warmth."
