      "Umber canvas falls in even lines from the conical ceiling to the overlapping rug floor, their long lengths weighted to prevent movement in the arctic winds.  Flickering braziers sway in their lofted position above as tendrils of chill air trickle through a small smoke hole in the ceiling to tug at them.  Several garments, hung from wooden pegs around the perimeter, flutter, their ends catching on the woven river reed baskets placed beneath them."
