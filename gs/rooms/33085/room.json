      "A series of sails is permanently affixed to the flotilla's built-up outer edges, casting shadows across the immense deck, and the entire south edge is blocked by the external wall of the Jetsam Court, its smooth planking allowing no purchase for any boarding party.  Partially blocking the way east, thick hempen rope coils into stacks higher than the tallest giant, with various sizes of anchors propped beside them."
