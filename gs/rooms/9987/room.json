      "The ravine ends abruptly in a wide, rocky area, the floor of the chasm smoothed by the pounding of falling water eons ago.  A few small trees and patches of weeds have taken root in the stony ground, amid piles of fallen rocks and a few bones of fallen adventurers, at the foot of the precipitous wall."
