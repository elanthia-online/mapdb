      "A beam of light filters through a crack in the stone above, throwing a bright patch on the floor.  A breeze of fresh air helps to dissipate the unpleasant acrid smell that seems to come from a deep tunnel that winds down into the dirt floor.  Faint clicking noises echo on the rock walls, but you cannot tell their source."
