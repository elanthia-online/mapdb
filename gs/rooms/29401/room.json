      "Inset into the westernmost wall is a small riverstone fireplace, a large pile of wooden sticks close at hand.  A comfortable distance away sits a plush crimson velvet sofa lofted on rounded, polished mahogany feet.  Taking up the entirety of the southern wall is a cushioned velvet bench, and a tall silver-framed mirror is nestled into one corner."
