      "Brightly lit and impeccably clean, this modest shop displays samples of various types of floors available for purchase.  Large, but still portable square sections of assorted wood, stone, and metal are lined on three tall, plain oak racks.  A plank of unfinished pinewood atop two sections of tree trunks has been turned into a makeshift customer counter, where several of the sample squares have been set down for a previous customer's evaluation."
