      "The room is a perfect circle carved from the obsidian of the walls and polished to a mirror smoothness.  Blue light dances on the domed ceiling some forty feet above, reflecting from the magical torches burning in their sconces on the walls.  Three steps lead up to the dais in the center of the room, and a heavy, intricately carved door opens into the wall opposite the entrance."
