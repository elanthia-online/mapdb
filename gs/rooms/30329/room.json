      "Dark-stained teak has been covered in a faint dusting of snow, the undisturbed flurries glinting in the ambient light across the wood.  Garland-strung copper fixtures outline the gangway where the gangplank descends to the dock below.  Hung along the solid railings to either side of the entry are a series of round shields, the armor adorned with ribbon-tied wreaths."
