      "Painted with splashes of gold and hunter green, it is standing room only at this end of the race track viewing stands.  Covering the oak plank floor, a mixture of confetti and sawdust is used to soak up the spilled ale from which a constant sour odor rises.  An enormous stuffed wolf head pierced through the eye with a golden arrow hangs above a set of steps leading down from the stands."
