      "Bones flow in a wide, bending river from the southwest to the east.  Black granite walls rise to the north and northeast, their flat vertical surfaces extending far off into the overhead darkness.  To the southeast, a huge pillar bursts from among the bones and climbs straight up to wherever the canopy resides.  The canopy's height is unknown, as the only way to find it seems to be through the use of imprecise echoes.  For all one knows it may be just as far down to the granite floor, too."
