      "Plain wooden walls rise from a mistwood plank floor.  Just above a pile of striped throw pillows hangs a rainbow colored flag, and an uneven wooden ceiling completes the picture.  A gold-leafed mistwood cabinet and a glass-topped mistwood counter stand side by side in the middle of the room."
