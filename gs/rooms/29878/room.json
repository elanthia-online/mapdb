    "description": [
      "An old pine palisade leans precipitously toward the outgoing road, a meandering stretch of hardpack and rocky earth that wriggles into the encroaching woodland.  Despite their obvious age, each wooden spike has a tip sharp enough to draw blood.  The trail, such as it is, proceeds through a small gap in the palisade wall.  To one side, a bent iron post supports a smoky old lantern whose flame does little to throw back the twilight.  Both post and housing are spotted heavily with rust."
