      "The walls are lined from floor to ceiling with ornately carved bookshelves that are filled to overflowing with tomes on various subjects.  A white-washed ladder leans against one wall, set on a rail to slide as required.  A willow wood desk, piled high with scrolls and tomes, dominates the center of the room.  Intricate candlelabras flank the desk and illuminate the walls, revealing a statue of Lumnis sitting on a shelf.  Some cushioned chairs placed about the room provide a comfortable place to sit."
