      "Colorful depictions of outdoor homes have been painted upon the walls in realistic detail.  Only the doors are real, though.  A white marble mansion looms on the north wall, complete with black wrought ironwork along its curtained windows.  The south wall displays a cute pink bungalow nestled within a stand of birch trees.  In the split between the northeast tunnel and the southeast tunnel, the bottom floor of a circular stone tower looms with candle-lit windows."
