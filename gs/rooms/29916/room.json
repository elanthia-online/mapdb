      "A tall fence surrounds a wide pasture bordered by several longhouses.  Goats the size of draft horses graze far off to the side of the road, their pale grey wool providing ample protection against the chill.  Leaning against the fence is a rough pinewood crook that looks nearly the size of a young tree.  The goats seem to be thriving while unattended, lazily foraging through the snowfall for shreds of hardy polar grass."
