    "description": [
      "The last verges of the jungle yield to cragged stone as the path approaches a wall of severe blood-black stone that rises toward the high hills at the island's heart.  Vines snake thickly over the rugged surfaces of the rocks, dotted with little white blossoms that are far less numerous than the barbed black thorns spiraling down their lengths.  Moss shelters in the depths of cracks and crevices, seeking solace from scouring winds that awaken a subtle, melodic hum from the rock face."
