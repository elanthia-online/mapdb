      "Curiously organic in shape, as if it were sprouting naturally from the ground, a ramp arcs toward a parapet standing beneath the luminous shadow of a singularly massive crystal.  Pillars of solid gemstone light the way, their towering heights and organic shapes impressive in their own right, but all are dwarfed by the monumental shard above.  The walkway is bathed in its fell glow, which mutates shadows into long and terrible shapes with ghoulish configurations."
