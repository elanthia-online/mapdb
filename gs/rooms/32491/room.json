      "To the northwest, the flagstones grow scarcer before giving way entirely to a narrow dirt trail that proceeds under an arch of sweetbriar into the gardens.  The paved walkway continues eastward, bending closer to the castle.  A wagon nearby is unattended, its bed full of grey and decomposing vegetation, though whether the refuse began as weeds or flesh plants for the garden is unclear."
