      "The ceiling of the hastily erected structure has been strung with alternating pennants of gold and green, each piece embroidered with the simple image of a rearing stag.  The air is filled with the din of clashing metal, cheers of the crowd, and chatter of the market behind the wood-framed stands, the ruckus an orchestra of sound echoing throughout.  Tree stumps and benches provide seating for observers, although the trampled grass below suggests that most prefer to stand for the event."
