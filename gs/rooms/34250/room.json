      "Huge mushrooms sprout to either side of the bridge as it stretches between two terraces of spongiform stone.  Their caps and fleshy stalks are imbued with exotic colors that range from iridescent blues to wild oranges, but their pale gills hold hints of unsettling hues without names.  Taller than trees, the fungi fill the air with a loamy scent that softens the acidic bite of vinegar roiling through the subterranean basin."
