      "The striking white-and-red marble flooring here is complemented by several thick rugs, predominately the hue of red sandstone, woven in a geometric pattern of seashells.  The hallway is lit by graceful seashell lamps that glow unwaveringly.  A single bright shaft of sunlight from one of the blue glaesine windows falls directly on a carved basalt arch piercing the eastern wall.",
