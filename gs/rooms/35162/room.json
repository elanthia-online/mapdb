      "Passing beyond the eaves as it slips through the branches of an ancient larch, sunlight slants across the brazier-lined corridor in long bands.  Creating the appearance of sinister sentinels, support posts carved to resemble wargs flank a set of descending steps and glare balefully at the gathering hall beyond.  A grey-washed dark pine door occupies the western russet-stained wall and is open to the brazier-warmed air."
