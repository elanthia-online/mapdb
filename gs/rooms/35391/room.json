      "Pillars frame the entrance to a southern corridor where flowers press close beneath the towering cypress, their outlines barely visible in the starlight.  To the north, cobalt blue ceramic tiles stretch across the courtyard, their deep hues muted in the hush of night.  Banners ripple faintly, their slow movements casting shifting shadows against the stone.  Stalls filled with beads and baubles catch the lantern glow, their gleaming wares nearly obscuring a raised dais beyond."
