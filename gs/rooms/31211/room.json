      "Moonbeams and starlight cast the entire observatory in a mystical glow, especially here, high atop the back of the dragon.  A comfortable-looking, cushioned bench fills most of this small area, but the centerpiece of the dragon is the large silver and brass telescope affixed near the dragon's neck and pointed toward the heavens.  Steps along the tail lead back down to the main floor of the observatory."
