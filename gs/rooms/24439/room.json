    "description": [
      "The burrow's northern wall is of dark stone, and out of its face has been carved the facade of an imposing keep.  Occasional pitting and rivulets worn out of the facade by the patient efforts of dripping water suggest that the stonework is ancient.  The cobbles of the walk to the entrance are alternating black and white, forming peculiar patterns.  Sculptures of walruses and seals flank the path.",
      "The natural stone chamber slants upwards, opening up the area to a carved black marble keep.  Surrounding the keep are several carved rhimar sculptures, each representing a grotesque winged demon ready to take flight.  Alternating white and black marble tiles spiral outwards creating strange, rune-like patterns."
