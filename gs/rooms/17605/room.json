      "Culminating in a slightly rounded edge, the jetty travels in a southeasterly direction towards the far shore.  A shielded fire, set within a wrought iron pit, signals to passing boats the proximately of the storm barrier and offers a modicum of heat from the bite of the crashing waves.  Scattered about the area are several loose stones, their edges rounded and their surfaces flat.",
