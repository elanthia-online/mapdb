      "This appears to be the living quarters of a high-ranking family of the troll clan, judging by the relative quality of the stinking, worthless skins on the matted beds that line the walls.  Some small glittering items are piled by the beds, and a large flat rock surrounded by two stumps and a smaller rock seems to serve as a table."
