      "Several bookcases line the walls and surround a bed with a battered leather sea chest resting at its foot and a glass-paned brass sconce hanging on the wall above it.  Narrow windows along the upper walls let in daylight, casting a shadow across a narrow maoral door.  A small stack of books next to the bed is topped by one entitled, \"Secrets of the Tempest River.\""
