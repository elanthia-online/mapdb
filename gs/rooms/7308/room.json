      "This is the burial chamber of a great warrior-king.  There are empty chests made of precious woods, now mildewed and rotten with fittings of beaten gold and silver.  Rusted weapons are scattered about.  A wooden coffin, carved in the shape of a proud warship with a dragon prow, lies at the far side of the circular room."
