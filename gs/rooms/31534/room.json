      "A huge four-poster bed dominates the center of this room, its sturdy rectangular posts reaching nearly to the ceiling.  A large circular wooden bath takes up the far corner of the room, and a squat mahogany armoire sits next to the doorway.  A huge ornamental vine stretches across the wall behind the bed, its hammered iron thorns polished until they shine."
