      "This room is excessively fragrant, due largely to the number of burning braziers interspersed about the space.  Each one appears to be emitting a slightly different hue of wispy smoke, and a purplish haze has accumulated along the ceiling, nearly obscuring the timber overhead.  A small desk sits against one wall, piled high with papers and scrolls of various sizes and shapes."
