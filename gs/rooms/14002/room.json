      "Decorating the walls of this passageway are a few tapestries depicting Silverwood events of the past.  One piece in particular seems dedicated to some kind of death-by-cookies game, while others are a simple representation of the sharing of knowledge.  An oak arch inlaid with silver scrollwork stands at the end of the hall, and a heavy pine door with a wrought iron handle interrupts the wall between a framed bit of aged parchment and a silver filigree-framed portrait."
