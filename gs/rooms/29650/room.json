      "Iron-banded barrels form both temporary dividers and seating in this area of the stands, each one painted with a gold stag rearing upon the surface of green-painted wood.  The mixture of muddied grass and straw clings tightly against the stacked planks and stone arranged in a semblance of horizontal rows, although a few of the pieces have been dislodged from use or perhaps an over enthusiastic observer."
