      "The temperature in this space is unnaturally cold, though there doesn't seem to be any particular source for the chill that permeates the room.  Heavy furs are draped along the walls, in many cases with the horns or antlers still attached, and a large bearskin rug dominates most of the floor space.  A set of heavy oak shelves is situated against one wall just inside the entrance, and an oversized chest is tucked into the back corner."
