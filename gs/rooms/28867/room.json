      "Sheltered by an arching ceiling of tan and white stone, the cloistered walk ends before the heavily adorned doors of worked bronze, polished free of dust or the darkening of time.  They shine brightly in the creamy marble facade of the chapel beyond, framed on either side by a quartet of stained glass windows depicting the seasons."
