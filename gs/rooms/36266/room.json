    "description": [
      "A cool breeze ruffles the canopy overheard, the tears in the fabric offering a temporary glimpse at the night sky constellations.  The salty scent of sea air wafts through the complex's skeletal walls, mixing with the smell of heated oils and metals and further punctuated by the stench of sweat.  Beside open crates filled with refined slabs of metal are iron braziers, the coals smoldering within.  Forgemaster Kutlosa stands beside the entrance to some some open-air forging workshops, a cocky grin playing on her lips."
