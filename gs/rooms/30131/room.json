      "Attached to a yard on a wooden mast, a misty grey hemp sail billows overhead casting shadows on the wide-planked deck.  Ropes crisscross back and forth, the intricate arrangement reminiscent of a perfectly laid out spiders web.  Smaller launch boats hang in cradles above both port and starboard sides raised above rows of cannons."
