      "Molten lava bubbles and explodes at the center of the lake of liquid rock that fills this chamber.  Large enough to hold a couple of good-sized manor houses, the heat trapped in here begins to sear exposed flesh within seconds.  The level of the lake must have been higher in the past since a ledge of black basalt circles the room and extends into the lava pipe to the west.  Part way up the chamber's dome a patch of sky is visible through a gaping hole in the basalt.",
