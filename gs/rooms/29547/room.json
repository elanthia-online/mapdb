      "Dirt and wood shavings litter the ground of the cramped office, which is crammed with neatly stacked crates, barrels, and multifarious other pieces of luggage.  A dour master porter oversees the proceedings, a grim look on his face.  Beneath an azure banner that loudly declares, \"You buy it, we move it\" is a prominent spruce sign listing a variety of stipulations and clauses."
