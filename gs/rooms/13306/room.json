      "High thuja hedges screen the city beyond the temple grounds from view, creating a small sanctuary in the bustling seaport.  Leading away from a gold-trimmed haon door, a white silk runner surrounded by verdant grass extends toward a rose-covered trellis that shelters a beautiful white marble statue.  A slate-lined walkway leads out of the bower, while a small grove of tanik trees leads to a pair of barely concealed cottages.",
      "Sculpted rose bushes ring the bower, their thin trunks adorned with violet ribbon streamers.  A white silk runner covered with scattered rose petals of all colors extends towards a trellis sheltering a statue of Oleani and Phoen in a passionate embrace.  A small grove of tanik trees barely conceals two tiny cottages from prying eyes."
