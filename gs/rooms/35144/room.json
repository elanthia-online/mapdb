      "Icy wind screams through the open window of the cell, leaching away what tenuous warmth manages to seep through its heavy metal door.  The bars offer a tormenting glimpses of freedom in the streets outside, but also permit the clanking armor of the jail's enforcers to filter in as they patrol past.  There is no bed, only a small pile of straw, and dark red runes are smeared on the walls."
