      "In this room you feel energy and power flowing all around you.  You are amazed that you can see the courtyard from the inside, while from the outside you cannot see in.  There are myriad crystal shelves and cabinets containing many rare magic items, strange powders and colored vials.  A large crystal workbench with a red stone imbedded in it rests in the center of the floor.  The moonlight that surrounds you is coming from the walls and the high windows in the tower.",
