      "Dark stone walls are infested along multitudinous cracks with a bright violet luminescence, its glow so vibrant as to faintly illuminate the majority of the dank, damp space.  Dripping down from the decrepit ceiling and oozing across the floor, viscous fluids and goo intermingle with scattered, nondescript bones, broken glass, and, in one corner, a collection of oversized rat's nests.  In the midst of it all, four candle-topped coffins offer a neatly laid out selection of curious oddities."
