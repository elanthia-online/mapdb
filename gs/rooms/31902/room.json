      "A pair of windows at the front of the store offers a view of the street outside and the tiny auroral starflowers blooming in the window boxes.  A worn wooden counter topped with a fraying silk-lined tray stretches nearly the full back wall of the cottage, while a moth-eaten velvet-cushioned glass gem case is stationed on one side of the shop and a unicorn-embossed shiny gold plate atop a slender stand is on the other.  A scrap paper note scrawled in childish handwritting is tacked to the front of the counter.",
