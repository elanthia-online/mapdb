      "Thick vines are draped across a series of river-reed arbors, the linked structures forming a tunnel down this section of the brick cobbled garden pathway.  Shadows lay heavy upon the area, with faint glimpses of moonlight peaking between the verdant leaves and the burgundy blossoms that resemble bright red child's pinwheels.  Carefully placed amid the colorful mandevilla vines are tiny blown glass orbs that emit a warm, golden radiance."
