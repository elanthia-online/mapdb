      "Sharply falling away, the buildings and warehouses of the western part of the city abruptly ends at a wide expanse of road that abuts the Vornavian cliffs.  Scaffolding, complex pulley systems, and anchored ropes ascend to the top of the cliff face and are utilized to lower various crated wares from the Solhaven streets to the ground below.  Two lines of goods, heavily guarded, await their final destination - either deeper into the city or up to the port town."
