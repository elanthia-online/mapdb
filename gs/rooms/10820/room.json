      "A thick, clammy haze oozes out of the surrounding weeds to choke the road and reduce vision to merely a few feet.  The moon is a wide orb with blurry edges hanging somewhere far above the mist, adding no heat to help assuage the dank chill.  If not for the few cobblestones still visible above the mud, the correct direction of travel would be anyone's guess.",
