    "description": [
      "Along the exterior of a vine-tangled ruin near the jungle's heart, ancient terraces burst with wild orchids, the extravagant blooms saturating the air with heady perfume.  Benches of dark-veined turquoise stone, crumbling and strangled by layers of green growth, sit along the perimeter.  The huge, rough-edged stones fitted together to form the ruin's cyclopean facade have weathered the ages with surprising fortitude, save for where the fall of a great meranti tree has left a broad crack in one wall."
