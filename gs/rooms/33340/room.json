      "Dew glistens on the rose bushes that ring the garden, and the uneven cobblestone path meandering through their concentric rows is illuminated by the silver glow of starlight.  Tracing a circuitous route from a wrought iron gate to the fel-timbered chalet, the path is guarded by a lithe faerie statue hiding amid a lilac bower.  Within the garden's heart, roses and flowerbeds open up in a small clearing where marble benches ring a huge bonfire, while the soothing song of crickets rises softly all around."
