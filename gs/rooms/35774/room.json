      "Sun-bleached fragments of crushed seashells pave a narrow path that winds through a flourishing tropical thicket, where palms and broad-leafed plants lean overhead.  A polished brass lantern with blue-tinted glass hangs from a driftwood post, its frame shaped like curling fronds.  A black marble door is set into a vine-draped hillside, while a tall tower with a large telescope protruding from the top floor rises above the trees."
