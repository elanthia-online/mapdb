      "Encrusted coral surfaces arch inward, veins of pulsing algae tracing winding fissures.  Clusters of glasstide roses sprout along coral outcroppings, their translucent petals flexing with each passing current.  Some braided seagrass strands hang like a veiled screen before a narrow corridor, their fibers swaying with the flow.  Giant shell chairs rest on smooth reef projections, carved into deep hollows."
