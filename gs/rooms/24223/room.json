    "description": [
      "Bowing low toward the swamp, a weathered plank footbridge crosses a narrow stretch of water.  The brackish water swishes softly against the shoreline, the ground covered in pumpkin vines, some attached to decaying shells of squash, that snake over the land in criss-cross patterns.  Several tall black cypresses tower overhead, their branches hanging down at awkward angles, much like disjointed limbs.  Through the trees, a small house is visible."
