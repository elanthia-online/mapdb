      "Beneath a pair of heavily gilded chandeliers, two fel-framed divans covered in rich citrine suede face each other across a low table of crimson-stained fel.  A thick bearskin rug has been stretched out in front of a tall, black stone fireplace in one corner of the room, a brass-framed oil painting hanging above a crowned hardwood mantle.  Panels of crimson velvet have been drawn over an expansive window, a writing desk at its centerpoint."
