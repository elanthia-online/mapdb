      "Huge conifers mixed with spreading deciduous trees block out most of the moonlight.  Moss grows thickly on the tree trunks and carpets the barely discernible trail that pushes through the thorny undergrowth.  To the southeast, the Vipershroud appears to thin, revealing patches of starry sky.",
