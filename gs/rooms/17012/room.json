      "This large room is filled with long wooden tables and benches.  The high stone walls are stained dark by the appetizing smoke from the cooking fires tended by the white-smocked apprentices who work behind the huge wooden counter at the far end of the room.  Cooks hurry in and out of a heavy steel door in the far wall, bearing armfuls of frozen meats and preserved foods."
