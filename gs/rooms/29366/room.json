      "Crescent-shaped tables and some curving birchwood benches fill the grand circular room at the base of the lighthouse.  Winding stairs climb the structure in a spiral to the top, while torch-bright sconces ring the space with cheerful light, supplemented by a brick-faced fireplace placed behind a lacquered walnut and mahogany bar.  Squeezed onto a small side stage, a disparate band of musicians circulates in and out of the pub, playing a boundless profusion of merry, foot-tapping music."
