      "You stand at the base of a jagged path that stretches up the side of a sheer cliff.  To the southeast of here extends a narrow valley, quite hidden and superbly isolated from the rest of the Upper Trollfang region.  Glancing about your surroundings, you also notice that you have made your way far to the east and are now directly south of Zeltoph Mountain."
