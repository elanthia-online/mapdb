      "Crimson-flamed torches in coiled tentacle brackets line the walls of this chamber, their flickering light dancing over a hoard that has been secreted away here for an unfathomable amount of time.  While less blood and flesh adorns the floor, cobwebs stretch from corner to corner near the ceiling, and even still, the sense of being watched persists.  Across from a barbed stone door is a wavering exit."
