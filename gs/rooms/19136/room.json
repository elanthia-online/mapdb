      "Several pink-painted tables have been carefully placed around the room, each with a matching pair of chairs pushed beneath them.  Colorful pink-framed paintings of flowers adorn the whitewashed walls along with pink shelves holding various knick-knacks.  A white door with a painted pink frame leads out of the shop."
