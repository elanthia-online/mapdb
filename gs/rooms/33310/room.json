      "Thin planks of blackened wood line the walls of the small nook.  Faded and worn, once-decadent green and gold rugs adorn a narrow walkway, while an old worn desk rests in one corner.  Against the far wall, a tall bookcase stands with several items on its shelves.  Lying on a small crate, a barely lit lamp gives a dim golden-yellow illumination."
