    "description": [
      "The gravel and rocks scattering the ridge side give way to a rocky shoreline trail that, while steep, seems safely traversible.  Down the trail, glimpses of habitation beckon in the form of small, huddled buildings of wood and grass thatching.  Despite the hour, no firelights are visible from the village.  It is shrouded thickly in mists coming off of the water."
