      "Plaid tablecloths in shades of umber, goldenrod, and deep burgundy drape a collection of square tables with hay bale seating arranged in a circle within the open grove, far enough from the trees to avoid the mist collecting there and close enough to the central bonfire to feel its warmth.  Beneath a banner lofted by rough-hewn wooden poles is a gourd-adorned buffet with an autumnal plaid tablecloth, with stacks and piles of dishes and silverware stocked at one end."
