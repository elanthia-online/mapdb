      "The rough-hewn ground is littered with fragments of broken glass, each shard stained in old blood.  A smooth slab of obsidian dominates the center of the cave here, and the darkness along the walls shifts and bends with a life of its own.  A statue of carved glittering crystal perches above the chunk of obsidian, its twisted shape glimmering from an unseen light."
