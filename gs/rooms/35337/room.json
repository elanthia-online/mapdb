      "Devoid of windows, the small shop room is nonetheless brighter due to the lanterns that hang from the exposed rafters.  Bright white paint decorates the walls and ceiling, though the floor is fashioned of lacquered teak.  Working behind a counter, the half-elven jeweler Celamyr appraises a variety of jewelry and gemstones when not greeting customers."
