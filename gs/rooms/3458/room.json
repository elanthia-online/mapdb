      "The lane turns sharply north, its forward progress blocked by a low stone well.  Attached to a length of frayed rope, the well's bucket has been hauled out of its depths.  Its wood looks to have been dry for some time.  Voices of parties heading home or to nearby taverns echo off of the brick facades of the narrow buildings to either side of the road, but the stretch is quieter than most of the surrounding district.",
      "Barley Lane turns sharply north here, its forward progress blocked by a community well.  This section of town is somewhat quieter, although occasionally, the voices of parties heading home or to a tavern echo off the narrow buildings."
