      "Jewel-toned swathes of fabric are draped across the jade-washed stucco walls of the shop, the brocades and laces entwined with chain-strung faerthiel in accompanying colors.  Wrought pewter brackets loft cases in vertical rows against the back wall, the footwear displayed behind panes of glass set before the ivy-curtained counter covered in dye swatches.  A lace-appliqued shoe form stands nestled in the far corner, its surface covered in silk-petaled naefira trailing down toward the planked floor."
