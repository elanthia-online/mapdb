      "Intricately carved pillars of oak rise high then arch overhead in stylized branches from which thousands of tiny lanterns of crystal and wrought vaalorn hang, each burning with a soft glow and reflected in the tall lancet windows that pierce the granite walls.  Elegantly carved busts of regal elves line the room, gazing silently on the events on the polished mistwood dance floor.",
