      "Cloyingly sweet, the scent of roses fills the air and occupies every single space within the garden.  Thick, cord-like vines choke the swing and benches to such a degree that they actually hold them several handspans above the ground and make them impossible to utilize.  Dark petals decorate the overgrown grass within the small garden and are thickest near an arched opening."
