      "A rich merlot carpet stretches from end to end of this large, spacious chamber, which is aglow from the moonlight shining in through several arched windows along an entire wall.  Large, verdant green plants rest in terra cotta vases in each corner of the room, and the walls are decorated with detailed paintings of nearby historical landmarks.  A circular table sits in the center of the room, surrounded by several wooden chairs.",
