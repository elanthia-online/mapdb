      "Stretching out over the deep ravine, the finger of land teeters precipitously over a drop of hundreds of feet.  Grasses grow doggedly up to and over the land's edge, their roots poking out of the underside of the thin lip of stone and earth.  A single boulder sits atop the bluff like a rocky crown."
