      "Some deep-graven etchings decorate the edifice's wall, depicting scenes of strife and violence in a primitive technique.  Near to the wall, something has breached through the hard earth, leaving behind a collapsed tunnel that has sunk the surrounding ground.  As of yet, it has not challenged the integrity of the structure's facade."
