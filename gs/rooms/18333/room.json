    "description": [
      "No fish can be seen darting beneath the surface of the slowly rippling water as the darkness of night renders the cool depths of the lagoon a dark black hue.  Providing the only available light in the area, moonlight streams down through the pale clouds drifting across the night sky and casts sparkling illumination upon the water's surface.  A cool night breeze occasionally circulates through the area, causing the water to ripple with light and shadow as the wind engages the liquid in an ethereal dance.",
      "The occasional fish darts through the slowly rippling water, the flash of silver scales as it moves a bright contrast to the deep blue of the lagoon.  Though the lack of trees ensures no shelter from the sun in the midst of the lagoon, the cool temperature of the water alleviates the heat to a tolerable level."
