      "Elaborately paneled with a mosaic of coral, the ceiling rises high above in a dome of brilliant, vivid colors that depict the bed of an ocean.  Rays of natural light from narrow slats in the ceiling penetrate swathes of chiffon in shades of blue, green, and silver cut to resemble ocean currents cascading down from above.  Shelves are built into the walls and a few racks are placed about the room to display items for sale."
