      "To the northeast, a flight of steps leads up, so icy that climbing their hazardous incline seems an impossible feat.  This platform is totally encased in a frozen sheet that muffles sound and reflects light in a glistening shimmer.  Above the treacherous ascent, a ledge is visible - and towering above that, a monstrous, serpentine figure reclines, its head and tail forming a protective curve around the ice-sheathed dais."
