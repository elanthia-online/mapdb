      "Highly polished stone walls and floor reflect the dim torchlight here, making it seem more than it is.  Painted iron doors studded with gems indicate the entrances into two more prisoner cells.  A set of low steps leads up toward the exit of the prison, while some steep stairs lead lower into darkness."
