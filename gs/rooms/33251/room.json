      "Silence.  Loneliness.  Despair.  Here you are lost, with no clear idea of when you will be found.  The oubliette is a round, featureless room, with no visible entryway or exit, save for a tiny grating some thirty or more feet above you.  Water drips down steadily from the metal grate, causing a faint rhythmic tapping noise to penetrate the ever present silence."
