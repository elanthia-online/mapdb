      "Living in this room would be easy, with sofas and chairs arranged into intimate groups.  The hard wood flooring, worn over the years by the footsteps of those long gone, still retains its beauty with deep green area rugs softening the hard flooring and dampening footsteps.  Cabinets line the eastern wall of the room, shelves lined with mementos of the many who have passed through these rooms.  A cool breeze filters through open windows which open to a large balcony."
