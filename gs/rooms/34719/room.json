      "Atop a winding green stone staircase stretches a long hallway that proceeds past the staring eyes of countless snakes carved onto the dark walls in bas-relief.  The serpents span a variety of shapes and sorts, but each has eyes of emerald that seem to glint with viridian flames from within.  Undulating to the left and right as it winds southward, the walkway passes by the statue of a scaled man clad in luxuriant robes."
