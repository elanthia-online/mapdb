      "Lustrous woods, ranging from blackest ebony to palest box, are joined to make the sinuous marquetry floor of this comforable room.  Rattan chairs with cushions upholstered in autumnal-hued tapestry are drawn up alongside an oak-framed fireplace, above which hangs a silver looking-glass in an oak-leaf patterned frame.  An ornately carved bar of inlaid fel runs along one wall, flanked by twin silver and black banners.  Almost obscured by the vines wrapped around the entry arch, a carmiln medallion reflects the firelight from its polished surface."
