      "A massive bower of woven vines and branches arches over the path leading north, its towering height laden with sweeping ribbons draped in scallops along its limbs to the peak, where they are held in place by an elaborate arrangement of autumn foliage and accents of walnuts, pecans, and apples.  Just beneath and strung from lengths of handwoven hemp rope is a rustic sign that reads, \"Welcome to Ember Ridge Orchard.\""
