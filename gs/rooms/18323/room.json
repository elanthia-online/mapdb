    "description": [
      "The salty scent of the ocean drifts in on the air circulating through the trees that frame the expanse of lagoon shoreline.  Leaves and various plants sway with a cool evening breeze as they crowd for space between the trunks and bamboo shoots in the shadows.  Damp from the occasional splash of water, several large rounds of grey stone serve as a path to a decorated bamboo hut flanked on either side by flickering torches."
