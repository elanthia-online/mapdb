      "Arrow-slit windows allow the twilight colors of the sky to paint the southern stones in shades of amber, violet, and cerulean, while a large cobblestone fireplace brands the room in orange, red, and yellow hues.  Despite the warmth of the fire, the air is still damp and laced with a pervading chill.  Positioned between the spiraling stairs and a copper and oak ladder, several armaments are arranged upon statuesque stands, each depicting warriors in combat poses."
