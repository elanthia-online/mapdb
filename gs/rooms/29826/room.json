      "Eclectic and cluttered, the dust-free shop has shelves filled with bric-a-brac and knickknacks that range in color, shapes, and sizes.  Frosted globes hover scant inches from the ceiling, their soft white glow casting eerie shadows that dance and flicker.  Short and tall armor mannequins create a maze of interestingly posed bodies throughout the center of the floor."
