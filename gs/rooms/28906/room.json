      "Colorful pennants and banners snap and flutter in the consistent seaborne breeze from their position along the roof of a narrow log-sided hall, their colorful ends and metallic threading sparkling in the starlight.  Soft voices filter in from the west where the open-air market is quiet, while the sound easy conversation comes from the east.  A large sign post planted in the ground has several arrow-shaped planks nailed to it, each scribbled with tiny letters and images.",
      "Colorful pennants and banners snap and flutter in the consistent seaborne breeze from their position along the roof of a narrow log-sided hall, their colorful ends and metallic threading sparkling in the sunlight.  Voices rise and fall from the west where the open-air market is in full swing, while the sound of industry travels in from the east.  A large sign post planted in the ground has several arrow-shaped planks nailed to it, each scribbled with tiny letters and images."
