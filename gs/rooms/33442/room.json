      "This is a long narrow space under the foundations of the house.  It is cooler than the rooms above and rather a bit damper.  Long rows of dust covered bottles sit on wooden racks along one wall.  Casks of ale, mead, brandy and other liquid delights squat along the other wall awaiting their call to duty in the lounges and rooms abovestairs. Beads of moisture collect along fissures in the walls and an occasional drip echoes faintly through the still air."
