      "Ice blue walls surround this small alcove off the central nexus to the south.  The focal point of the space is a swirling white and green portal framed by an oval of wrought silver.  Myriad snowflakes have been etched into the metal, each one different from the last, much like their icy inspirations.  A cold breeze swirls around the area, scented of the unique flora of Icemule Trace."
