    "description": [
      "Except for the occasional moan or scream of agony from an adjacent sauna, few sounds pierce the silence in what could, at best, be called a large coffin.  Towering black wooden walls seem to push in from four sides, leaving barely enough room to turn around without hinderance.  The basement air fails to supply even a hint of a breeze to help evaporate the sweat puddling on the floor.  Not surpisingly, the stench rivals that of a troll king in mid-summer."
