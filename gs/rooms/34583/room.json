      "Several cushioned chairs and sofas are placed about the room.  A narrow bench with ornate clawed-feet rests before a small writing desk that is set between two large bookcases holding every form of book, journal, and scroll.  Evenly spaced about the room are pewter sconces, each holding a trio of candles, their symmetry broken by a large modwir-framed painting that dominates one wall."
