      "Moonlight pours through the glass roof onto lush greenery in terra-cotta pots, the petals of the scarlet hibiscus tightly closed for the night.  High-backed wicker chairs flank glass-topped sideboards set with cocktails, while green felted tables host lively card games and rolling dice.  A pair of ebonwood doors with hazy window panes opens out onto a lantern-lit patio overlooking the hotel grounds and expansive gardens."
