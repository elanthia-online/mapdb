      "Acicular crystal formations pierce through the mahogany planks of the repurposed house, their facets glinting from the pulsing glow emanating from a dusty, orb-capped chandelier.  A barbed wrought iron stand casts spiked shadows softened by the gentle, rhythmic illumination.  Barely concealing a narrow staircase, devore velvet curtains patterned in monochromatic florals echo the profusion of black star calla lilies framing the glass display case set to one side."
