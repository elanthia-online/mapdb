    "description": [
      "Judging from the copious jags of rubble poking out of the deep snows, the tower that stands near the western edge of the pale stone road once stretched high into the sky.  It has been brought low, and all that remains is a broken ruin as squat and useless as a spent candle.  What remains of the arched entrance suggests that it was once an entryway of staggering height."
