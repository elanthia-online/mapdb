      "The barley field is a buzz of activity--literally.  Gnats, flies, and other small flying insects wing their way over the green plants, alighting here and there with no apparent sense of purpose or direction.  Spiders weave their webs between and within the plants in hopes of intercepting some of these airborne insects.  Snails and slugs crawl slowly underneath the plants, searching for decaying matter to consume, while lines of ants industriously move food into their conical mound."
