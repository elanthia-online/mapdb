      "Several large boulders rising up from the sandy bottom dominate this stretch of the riverbed, rising far enough up to be a hazard to navigation without breaking the surface.  The algae and moss that have taken up residence there serve, in turn, as host to schools of minnows that nibble at their edges with dainty jabs."
