    "description": [
      "The eye-watering pungence of ammonia trickles from craggy vents along the ground, joining with a noxious fog that crawls over the floor of the natural stone gallery.  Thick lengths of ropy, mud-colored silk droop from the ceiling, but they have been eaten away by the corrosive gases and hang in ragged clots that ooze fat droplets onto the ground.  Only the rushing air currents of the cavern offer any relief from the toxic onslaught.  To the west, a gash in the wall offers access to a narrow tunnel."
