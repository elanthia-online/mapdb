      "Silk and vellum-crafted florals decorate the sky blue maedatha walls of the shop, the unfurling blooms partially covering the heartleaf-forged racks set along the periphery.  Hemp-wrapped crossbeams create the framework of the tent, the wood wound in diminutive faerthiel, the tiny lanterns illuminating the pathway to the northern room."
