      "A dense tangle of forest cucumbers grows in the space left where a large fig tree once stood.  The giant now lies in decay amid the vines, though a few of its pieces still offer evidence of the decades through which the tree stood tall and proud.  Around the circular area, a growth of young fig and branzila trees push their leaves upward toward the sky in a desperate, though silent struggle for the vacated column of light.",
