      "This small room seems even smaller because of the tremendously high ceiling here.  Nearly cutting the room in half is a large counter.  Behind the counter and hanging on the back wall is the Wheel of Chance.  Keeping a watchful eye on the entire proceedings is a large man, the hawker.  The only exit is through the narrow arch that leads back to the main gaming hall."
