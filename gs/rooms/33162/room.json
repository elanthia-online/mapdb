      "Elaborately figured silken tapestries enfold this space, their scenes of heroic battles retelling the glorious deeds of the House of the Rising Phoenix.  Comfortable chairs are clustered around a gold-veined onyx fireplace, above which is set a beveled glaes mirror framed in gold.  Along one wall, flanked by two gold-edged banners bearing the device of a crimson phoenix on a field of black, a small bar holds libations for the weary.  A faceted ruby medallion is set at the apex of the red marble arch leading into the room."
