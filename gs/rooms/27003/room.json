      "Gathering light to its corona, Tilaok dominates the northeastern landscape and eclipses the valley's shadow with its fiery presence.  Faint traces of verdant green light filter through the area from their origins in the protective shield, the edges of which mingle with the colorful ribbons of the northern aurora.  Seeming almost white in the fluctuating light, a glass-lined ring pulses nearby."
