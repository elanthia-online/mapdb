      "The ivy-framed windows of the vibrant stucco shops display wares behind painted panes of glass, the garments and artwork sat upon ship-styled shelves carved from driftwood.  A trio of filigree-set birdcages stand beneath the shade of a blue-purple wisteria tree, the arboreal form spilling a waterfall of blooms across the blown glass lovebirds perched within the aviary.  The sweet scent of wisteria blossoms permeates the air, intermingling with the coils of downy peonies decorating the shop doorways."
