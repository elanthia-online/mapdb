    "description": [
      "Scrub hawthorn branches have been fashioned into corrals for milling herds of roltons, their bleats echoing off a fringe of buildings circling the pens.  The animals bare their formidable teeth at each other, frightened into confrontation by their confinement.  A few lanky youngsters hang from the rungs of the fences, eyeing the animals and commenting on the quality of their fleeces."
