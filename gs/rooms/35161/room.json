      "[The Raider's Take, Mead Hall]"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Scattered with orange-tinted pine needles, the hard-packed floor of the mead hall stretches to the south, culminating in a high privacy wall to the north where a variety of naval raiding objects are hung.  Bronze braziers keep the space warm, despite the cool air filtering down through the gap where the western and eastern roofs end.  Benches flank rectangular tables beneath the protective cover and ascending steps lead to the inn's guest rooms."
