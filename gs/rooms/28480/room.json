      "This small space is clearly intended for work, not leisure.  A simple wooden desk sits to one side, piles of parchment mounded high on its surface.  A many-paned window allows for a great deal of natural light, though the walls bear several unlit torches which stand ready, should their illumination be required.  Interspersed around the area are a collection of padded benches.",
      "Stark and utilitarian, this room still carries the slightest hint of fresh paint.  The walls are a neutral beige color, and the carpet underneath is only the barest shade darker.  Unobtrosive candleabras are placed in each corner, and their combined light illuminates all four corners evenly.  A series of wooden benches are arranged neatly in angled rows, each facing a small mahogany desk which sits directly beneath a frosted glass window."
