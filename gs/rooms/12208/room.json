    "description": [
      "A mass of pulsing and twitching tissue sits to the west.  At first, the booming that rolls through the air sounds like thunder, but a moment of listening proves it to be too regular and rhythmic to be a storm.  Thump-thump... thump-thump....  All at once the source comes to you, and as you gaze at the tissue you realize it is a giant heart.  Grey-green worms chew through the flesh, and listening to the beating it becomes obvious that they are killing the heart, and whatever creature it belongs to."
