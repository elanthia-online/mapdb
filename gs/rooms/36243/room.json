      "Imperfect slate and travertine tiles are arranged to create a terrace just outside the kitchen, and a large pergola is strung with strings of tiny votive holders filled with flickering candles.  Beneath the flowering vines sits a huge slab of mica-sparked granite serving as a dining table, with long polished benches of rosewood flanking it.  Off to one side is a deep fire pit set with rods used for roasting and a hive-shaped oven for baking."
