      "A repurposed rum barrel, the perch is filled with the sound of caws from a cage filled with inky black crows hanging from the top of the main mast.  Half of the barrel bottom has been removed to allow access to the rope ladders leading back down to the main deck.  A tarnished brass spyglass is mounted to the barrel."
