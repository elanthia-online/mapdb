      "Amidst a persistent scent of charred wood and a faint crackle of embers in the air, the vague resemblance of a cookery emerges, its culinary furnishings and equipment mostly covered in a thin layer of ash and soot.  Currently in a restoration phase, a solid maple block and a tall oak pantry possess a number of items seemingly spared from the blaze, and the tiniest whisper of a recently cooked meal lingers in the air, inviting a promise of future endeavors."
