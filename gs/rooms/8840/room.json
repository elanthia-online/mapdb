      "A grove of large boulders throws a little shade over a cluster of buildings.  Rocks stand around, some half-carved, most just positioned, creating a haphazard walkway between the dwellings.  One large stone, certainly the most dominant one of the group, is carved into the image of a golem, its heavy features somber with thought.",
