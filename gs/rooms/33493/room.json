      "Dimly lit, the interior is tightly packed with cluttered aisles, leaving little room to move around.  Multiple instruments rest on lacquered wooden shelves, while several others are displayed against the walls.  Small bronze placards are placed near each instrument, detailing its intended use.  Despite the confined space, the arrangement of the instruments is orderly and systematic.  Against the far wall, a large glass case exhibits several wares for sale."
