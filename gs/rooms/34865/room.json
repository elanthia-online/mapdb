      "Sturdy floorboards of whitewashed oak form a decorative herringbone pattern on the front porch landing of this isolated cottage.  Centered prominently within the cottage's clapboard face is a tall witchwood door.  For as sturdy as the flooring appears, an ominous creaking can be detected whenever anyone nearby approaches the open doorway."
