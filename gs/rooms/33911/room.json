      "The high-arching ceiling of the stables provides respite for several hay-filled nests, the avian occupants quietly chirping from the rafters above.  Fine-grained planks of ashen haon form the foundation of the stables, the framework reinforced by blackened iron and branded in elaborate insignias.  The wide sash windows allow the ambient ocean breeze to idle through, the gentle draft rustling the hemp-bound bales of straw stacked neatly beside each stall."
