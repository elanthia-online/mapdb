      "Obvious effort has been expended to make this attic space respectable and neat.  No boxes or other storage containers clutter the corners, and the floor speaks of a recent soaping.  Brightly burning candles sit in polished sconces on either side of the door to the north.  Little crystals dangle from the holders, as if attempting to catch a casual observer's attention."
