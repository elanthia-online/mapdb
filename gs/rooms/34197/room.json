      "Towering stalactite columns drip down from the high, uneven ceiling of the natural cavern, descending into misted pools of blue-green water alight with speckled bioluminescent algae.  The heavy air swirls with drifting vapor that reeks of sulfur and a nigh-choking astringent musk.  Wet clusters of tiny pink and crimson eggs overflow shelves carved into the rock as well as the bulbous stone formations that cradle them.  Flaky white secretions discolor the dark stone, caked more thickly nearest the eggs."
