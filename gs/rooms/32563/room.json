      "Generously padded chairs surround small glass-topped tables covered in silk tablecloths, and ceramic tiles continue along the walls from the front room, adding a complementary decor to the area.  A dimly-lit corner offers a more secluded gathering spot, away from the constant flurry of bakery visitors."
