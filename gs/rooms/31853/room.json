      "The sharp smell of the sea permeates the air here, the scents of acrid smoke, rotten eggs, and burnt hair adding extra notes to the aroma.  Nestled into a hearth at one end of the room is a huge cauldron, the ceiling above stained black with soot.  Pushed into one corner is a water-stained wooden work table, a warped stool sitting askew in front of it, while a barnacle-covered wooden shelf is mounted above.  A discolored wooden door, its surface covered in a plethora of pinned papers covered in smudged handwriting, leads to a yard.  Much of the cottage is water-damaged, as though it has recently flooded."
