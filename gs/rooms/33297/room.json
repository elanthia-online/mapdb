      "Surrounded by tapestry covered walls, the gallery's landing is comprised of a clean, polished wood floor and sparse furnishings.  Emerald green runners line the way, each spreading from the wall-hugging stairs and disappearing into the wings in the northeast and southeast.  An aerial view of the vestibule is beyond a set of fel railings, while ornate pillars and a short wall provide a stone-framed view of the Great Hall below."
