      "Tidy rows of plush seats are arranged facing an elevated stage.  Dark blue velvet curtains drape the wall behind the platform, their sheen set softly aglow by dimly lit crystal-globed chandeliers suspended from the darkened ceiling.  Covered in lushly carved wooden paneling expertly designed to amplify sound, the walls of the auditorium gradually narrow until they meet the sides of the stage, providing a singular point of focus."
