      "Layered rock makes up most of the ground, covered in parts by drifts of sand and silt.  Shaleflare moss clings to the grotto walls, its soft bioluminescence illuminating the area.  Resting in the center lie a warped pine sea trunk and a battered oak sea chest, their lids open to display their contents."
