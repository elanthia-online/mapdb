    "description": [
      "The Dead Plateau's interior spreads out to the northeast as far as the eye can see.  A flat expanse of wind-scoured rock, the plateau would be easily traversable except for the myriad crevices and cracks that run helter-skelter throughout the interior.  Some are small and easily crossed, while others yawn widely with no discernible bottom.  Only the edge of the plateau appears relatively intact, and it is this edge that the trail follows."
