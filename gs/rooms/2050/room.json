      "At the top of a ridge, the jungle stands as an almost impenetrable guard against intrusion.  Vines loop around the huge trunks of trees and wind up into the darkness of the upper canopy like a living veil.  What little breeze is able to find the embankment is so heavy with fumes from the swamp below, it is more a menace than a relief.  A trail winds into the verdure, disguised by mammoth-sized leaves and roots.",
