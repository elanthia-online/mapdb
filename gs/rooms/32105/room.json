      "The air is moist, its scent so strongly laden with loam and decay that it practically tastes of it.  Formed from the halves of two broken altars, four stone benches are angled in toward each other to face a rocking chair that sits at the dead center of the octagonal chamber.  Beneath it, the makings of a ritual circle and its associated runes sprawl outward in imperfect symmetry before abruptly terminating just shy of the violet phosphorescence-riddled walls, each of which houses a tomb in its earthen embrace."
