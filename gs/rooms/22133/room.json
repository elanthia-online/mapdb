      "Set upon a small decorative table, tiny goldfish swim about a small bowl, their small bodies darting and dancing about each other in the water.  Several potted plants are placed along the hallway between a series of doors.  The pristine white walls are a perfect background for the verdant foliage.  Polished linden molding continues along the ceiling, the golden wood adding warmth to the area."
