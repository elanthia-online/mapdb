      "The south end of the wagon has been painted in muted green shades and clusters of ferns and crocuses have been propped up on the end of a set of rough oak shelves.  An oversized varnished oak couch sits snugly between a recess at the far wall of the wagon, the vibrant color of its cushion faded in the middle."
