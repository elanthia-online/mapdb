      "The howling of the wind resounds through your head, lulling you into a half-trance as you stumble over the ice.  The flying ice and snow pelting you leave you as numb in body as the wind has left you in mind, leading your thoughts downward in a spiral of near hopelessness.  Night seems absolute here, and try as you might to recall it, the memory of the sun's warmth eludes you.",
