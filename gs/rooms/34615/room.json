      "The roadway winds by an ornate stone colosseum that stands atop a low hill garlanded with bloodwood trees.  Severe bronze figures clad in a veneer of verdigris gaze outward from niches along the three-tiered building's exterior, baleful gazes staring outward as if in defiant challenge.  A stone-lined pathway climbs toward the entrance, flanked by lampposts hoisting great lanterns of dark steel and cut glass aloft."
