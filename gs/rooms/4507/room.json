      "Spiraling sharply to work its way past an enormous stalagmite, the path skirts the growth that projects from below like a giant tusk, piercing multiple levels of the cave structure.  The colors on the wall are rich and saturated, ranging at the top from a red-tinged plum to deepest blue.  Tiny bits of mica are imbedded in the rock walls, catching and reflecting sparks of light like embers in a dying fire."
