      "The walls of the store's entrance have been sundered and blackened, the larger holes patched with strips of metal and planks of wood.  Wisps of smoke and vapor spiral around a lazy little twisting dust devil slowly drifting across a patch of loose floorboards.  The shop continues beyond a long cracked display rack, narrowing sharply where the walls have almost entirely caved in."
