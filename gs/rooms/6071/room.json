      "The rows of barley plants make a sharp turn from the west to the northwest, or vice versa, depending upon which way one is traveling.  It appears as though the farmer has taken a little time recently to drag the hoe between these rows of plants.  Only a few weeds cautiously extend their stalks or leaves above the level of the barley plants, and the dirt between has been recently turned over.  The barley plants appear healthy and vigorous, appreciative of the weeding efforts."
