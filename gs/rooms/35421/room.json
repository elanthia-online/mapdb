      "This wagon's wood-paneled walls are painted a pale ivory and are further decorated with a thin, matte silver plating.  Between these plated segments, a series of lanterns have been hung by thin metal hooks.  To one side of the room is a lounging and viewing area, featuring a violet velvet couch next to a tall silver mirror with a  over it.  Opposite, several simple wooden pieces display the wagon's wares, including a table, a cabinet, a rack, and some crates.  At the wagon's rear is a slatted brocade curtain leading out."
