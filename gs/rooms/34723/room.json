      "An archway vaults over the entrance of the temple, formed from acrobatic bodies of pale green jade enthusiastically intertwined with one another.  Garlands of liana woven with orchids and rockroses drape over the delicate shoulders of a statue atop a dais trimmed in tentacles.  The glow of amber beeswax candles reflects gently off of the burnished green marble of the floor."
