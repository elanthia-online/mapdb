      "The narrow path abruptly ends where the high cliffs sharply veer to the northeast, widening the view of rock-strewn bluegrass hills gently rolling toward the snowy mountains.  Yurts are arranged in semicircles around small fires, each cozy grouping flanked by either plum or cobalt banners.  A thin layer of hoarfrost, glittering in the sunlight, clings like flock to the needles of the scant whitebark pines peppering the landscape.",

Yurts are arranged in semicircles around small fires, each cozy, orange-cast grouping flanked by either plum or cobalt banners.
