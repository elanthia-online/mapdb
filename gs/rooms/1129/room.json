    "description": [
      "A creek barely ten feet wide cascades down from the east and rushes off to the west, gurgling happily.  Sunlight filters through the trees on either side to sparkle off the flowing waters.  The creek is not more than a few inches deep and would be easy to ford if the trail decided to go that way.  Instead, the trail parallels the creek to the east and moves off into the forest to the southwest.  A slightly greenish tinge to the water suggests that it might not be potable."
