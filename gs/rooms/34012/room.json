    "description": [
      "High bushes encircle the quaint backyard that has a fanciful border of paper flowers in a variety of hues.  Wooden birds are propped in decorative cloth and wrought iron trees, their wings painted in brilliant blues and greens.  A long cotton clothesline houses a variety of clothing items supported by clothespins, while a woven wicker hamper beneath is filled with a collection of matched and unmatched socks.  Sitting alone, a deep steel wash basin overflows with miscellaneous armor pieces and props the dollhouse's whitewashed back door wide open."
