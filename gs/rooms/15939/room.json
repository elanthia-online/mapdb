      "Creaking and shifting incessantly, the elm wooden walls and roof, and even the rotting doorway, of the shack appear to be hanging on to the very edge of total collapse.  A short jagged-edge table stands in the center of the room, with two rickety chairs framing its length.  Along the rear wall, a makeshift chimney is filled with soot and burnt, decayed remains, and the air is filled with an overwhelming amount of dust and a sharp, rancid stench."
