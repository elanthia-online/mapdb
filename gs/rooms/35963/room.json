      "Carved with delicate flourishes of acantha leaves, the banister follows the broad, sweeping curve of the gleaming mahogany steps along the winding staircase.  Near the arched opening of a long hallway on the landing is a cushioned bench, designed less for rest than for ceremony, as though the climb itself is part of the hotel's silent pageantry.  Above, the stairs still wind on."
