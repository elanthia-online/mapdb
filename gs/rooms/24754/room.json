      "A large assortment of tapestries depicting ancient battles adorn the walls of this magnificent room.  A large bed stands in the middle of the room, covered with animal furs from around the realm.  In one corner is an exquisite desk made of the finest teak wood and fitted with obsidian latches, and in the other is a stone column covered in wood.  On the wall is mounted a rather well-used falchion with an engraved plaque below it."
