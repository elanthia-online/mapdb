      "Chain-strung ship lanterns illuminate a thick layer of cigar smoke hovering above a long basalt-topped bar lined with several mismatched stools and a buxom mermaid figurehead propped at one end.  Stacked against the back wall behind the bar, tapped oak barrels branded with exotic ports of call drip ale onto crates filled with bottled spirits.  Several tables have been pushed out of the way to make room for a dart board fashioned from a ringed section of tree trunk stuck with a bone-handled dagger in the center."
