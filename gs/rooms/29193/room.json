      "Enormous, jet black boulders guard the waterline beneath the westernmost pier.  Standing as sentinels against the onslaught of crashing waves, each shimmers only briefly with the reflected rays of the sun before its slick, dark surface is awash yet again.  Gulls perched atop each jagged behemoth squabble over morsels, filling the air with their raucous cries."
