      "No effort has been made to make this hovel inhabitable by any but those with the lowest of standards.  The wooden floorboards are so sodden and mired in the muck that they have grown a thick layer of mildew, creating a slippery hazard with every step.  Holes and cracks in the ceiling and walls have been covered with poorly cleaned animal hides and pieces of tin.  In the corner is a heap of moldering rags and scraps of fabric, and an overturned crate sits nearby, perhaps to serve as a table."
