      "Surrounded by railings and high walls of protective glass, the enclosure provides a view of a veritable of a small forest with a faux cliff.  In the distance, a mammoth nest is visible upon an outcropping and is built within the crux of two flat stones that are braced against each other.  Adult griffins fly back and forth from the spot, attending to the structure itself and occasionally disappearing within.  Near at hand, a set of winding steps surrounded by smaston bushes lead into a tall stone tower.",
