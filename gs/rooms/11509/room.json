      "Shattered glass lies scattered about on the floor where two large aquarium tanks have been broken, and a variety of fish skeletons lie mixed with other, more unusual, aquatic remains.  Several other glass tanks still filled with water stand throughout the room.  Large globs of green algae cover the sides of the tanks."
