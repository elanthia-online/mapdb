      "Customers, both corporeal and ethereal, pass through the high-arched witchwood doors framing the grey stone building, the sounds of coin-handling muffled by the embroidered tapestries suspended from floor to ceiling.  The vine-engulfed counters are separated by tall dividers formed from lacquered scraps of parchment, their surfaces scrawled in a variety of languages.  An avian skeleton gazes from atop a stack of books, mimicking the motions of preening itself as it attempts to stretch its bone-set wings."
