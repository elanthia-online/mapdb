      "Carved from the mountainside, the room is narrow but well-lit, and is mostly dominated by a varnished maple desk, behind which sits a lovely blue-eyed initiate.  Tall, branched candelabra of wrought iron frame the desk to either side, filling the chamber with honeyed light and the heady sweetness of hot beeswax."
