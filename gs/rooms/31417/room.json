    "description": [
      "Lifelike vines painted along the walls seem to writhe in an artistic display of optical illusion, their sinuous, briar-laden shapes twisting about a series of blued steel racks hanging above a dusty mahogany counter.  In one dusty corner, a vine-wrapped cherrywood box has been shoved under a scratched ebonwood shelf, a wild rose bush fighting to escape its terracotta confines sitting next to it.  Several actual vines creep in from cracks in the ceiling and dangle overhead in an almost menacing array of verdure."
