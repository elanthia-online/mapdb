      "Grass grows thickly around and in places over the large granite boulders that litter the hillside.  Downhill to the northwest, the vegetation sheers away to expose a great shadowy cut in the earth.  A narrow track runs along the top of the cut, following a more gentle slope downhill to the northeast.  The track curls around the hillside to the north as it ascends and disappears around a mossy knoll.",
