    "description": [
      "Spacious and airy, the lobby of this small island inn welcomes the weary traveler.  Tucked away in the far corner of the room, a simple wooden staircase spirals up, out of sight, to the second floor.  Casual groups of comfortably worn sofas and chairs are scattered about.  At the base of the staircase, a jovial innkeeper stands behind a massive counter, passing out keys and keeping an eye on the lobby.  Occasional bursts of laughter filter in from the archway to the north."
