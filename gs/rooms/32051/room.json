      "Bulging, magenta pustules dot the rounded purple caps of tree-sized toadstools draped with sickly green, tentacular vines.  Their cores have a faint, deep amber glow, adding to the garishness of the multicolored scenery.  Large enough to devour a halfling, carnivorous plants stand with their cilia-fringed mouths agape, waiting to snap shut around unsuspecting prey."
