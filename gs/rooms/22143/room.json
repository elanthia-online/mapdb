      "Tall bookshelves line two walls of the cozy chamber, their shelves filled nearly to overflowing with books, scrolls and folios of documents set in orderly rows.  A carved linden door stands between them at one end of the room, opposite an expanse of glass providing an inspiring view of Solhaven Bay.  Drawing the sea indoors with its color, a plush ocean blue rug covers the floor.  A large oak desk is positioned centrally, with a cushioned leather chair drawn up behind it and backed by the massive window."
