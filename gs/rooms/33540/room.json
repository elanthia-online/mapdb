      "Worn, dingy canvas walls, supported by a bronze-braced metal frame, trap the aroma of oil and rust in the compact tent.  Amongst tightly coiled springs and well-used tools, patinated gears and cogs litter the top of a worktable behind an oil-stained elm counter displaying gnomish gadgets.  A brass-caged lantern glows warmly from the low-peaked ceiling, the orangey light glinting off the rows of glass bottles lined up on a copper-riveted steel rack."
