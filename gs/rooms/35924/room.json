      "In the scant windows left open by the full, color-laden tree branches overhead, glimpses of the twilight sky press through, and the miniature paper lanterns strung from the underside of the canopies keep the darkness at bay.  Swags of gauzy bronze-hued fabric drape the fencing that bookend either side of a similarly adorned woven willow branch archway that leads to a bright clearing to the northeast."
