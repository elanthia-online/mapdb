      "Rocks slip out from under your feet.  You grasp convulsively at the stone around you, trying to get a more solid grip as you scale the side of the mountain.  The tiny trail you climb winds up to a ledge above you, which seems flat and stable, and down to the ground beneath you.  You only hope you make it up or down before you tumble earthward."
