      "Ivory sedge speckled with greenish-white flowers reside beneath the bright green boughs of ornamental shrubs that tumble into the area and abruptly stop at the cliff's edge.  Wind whistles as it passes by, the passing zephyr's fingers stealing loose flowers, gravel, grass, and leaves and carrying them down the side of the mountain.  An enormous crack in the granite reveals a small stream that bubbles up from under the ground only to disappear over the edge."
