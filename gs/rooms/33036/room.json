      "A display of ornate tapestries line the expanse of bare grey stone walls, rising from the tiled floor to the tie beam of the high vaulted ceiling.  Although spacious and airy with tall mullioned windows, the room feels cozy due to the inglenook fireplace taking up most of the back wall and the large oaken table and benches running down the middle.  In the far corner, shadowed by the overhanging gallery, stands a graceful harp and small stool, awaiting an adept to fill the hall with music and song."
