      "Shaded by venerable hawthorn trees, the walkway extends northward to an open-air stall beneath a portico.  Reaching out beneath the trees like the spokes of a wheel, walkways connect a score of workshops to the central portico, where an elven attendant waits behind a counter.  A tall gatehouse pierces the courtyard's southern wall and marks the entrance to the compound."
