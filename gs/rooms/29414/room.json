      "Several lanterns hang from above on the pavilion's support poles, providing illumination and casting pale light over everything.  Most of this area is open, with a carved mistwood display and a golden oak rack sitting several feet apart in the center.  Standing alone along one wall is a small faewood table.  A plush silk runner continues to lead deeper into the pavilion."
