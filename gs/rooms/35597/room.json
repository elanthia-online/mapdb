      "Unnatural cold that has nothing to do with the ocean wind clings to the deck of the old ship.  The old vessel looks too dilapidated to be seafaring, the planks of her deck weathered to a dusky silver where they are not stained grey-green by the spread of enterprising algae, but she sits tall and grim in the water.  A rope ladder dangles from a space between the ship's gunnels, its lowest rungs frayed and lost to rot."
