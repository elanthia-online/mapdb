    "description": [
      "Warm air bearing the scent of mineral-laden water billows from the northeastern end of the passage, where the tunnel broadens abruptly and gives way to a cavernous space.  The dark stone here is deeply scored, streaked by some pale, lichenous substance.  Tattered veils of sickly yellow-green webbing drape across the upper mouth of the cavern and trail rust-fringed filaments that drift with the movement of the air.  Rapidly dripping water echoes from within a ragged cleft set partway up the tunnel wall."
