      "Falling in unfettered folds from the conical peak to the grass-dappled ground, the walls are fashioned of canary yellow and anchored by large, tumbled stones in grey and white.  Scattered rugs of teal and chocolate brown rest upon the wild grass, whose blades peak up in stiff tufts wherever the rugs fail to meet.  A makeshift sleeping pallet covered in blankets rests beside a workbench covered in various jewelry-making tools, while a lantern hung from the central post fills the space with bright light."
