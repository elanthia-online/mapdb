      "The stench of fresh fish fills the air of the quay, which overlooks the jagged breakwater known as The Fang, its shape sullen and gnarled against the graceful expanse of the bay and its fathomless waters.  A vendor's stand, comprised of barrels and casks filled with shellfish packed in ice, is crammed into a small space between two other hawkers.  Moonlight gleams dully from the ice crystals in the barrels.",

Sunlight sparkles from the ice crystals in the barrels, lending motes of brightness to the otherwise dull and weathered appearance of the quay."
