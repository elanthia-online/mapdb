      "Within the dark depths of the wood, warm flashes of golden light bob and weave between the shadowed trunks of the trees, tiny motes that flare to life, die, then are resurrected in their dance toward the path.  The closer they get, the brighter they are, until eventually the meandering fireflies break from the underdark of the wood and join their light with that of the luminaries overhead."
