      "Holding court amid carefully arranged moss-covered stones, an enormous twisted beech grows along the western curve of the road.  Ropy roots disturb the cobblestones, creating a textured pathway that can be treacherous if not carefully trod upon.  As the road transitions to the smoother footing to the north, it inclines slightly to become part of an arching bridge."
