      "Fine-grained dark wood spans the length of the brig's deck, highlighting a pale silken canopy suspended above half of the vessel to protect the wares for sale.  A wide, spacious forefront houses a rich black walnut cabinet and a lacquered fel marquetry wardrobe, the pair flanking a damask-motif leather trunk placed at the center.  Sleek ebon linen sails loom overhead, casting floating shadows upon everything below their cover."
