      "Behind the clear crystal of the granite counter is an assortment of prepared meats and other delectables.  Smoked, broiled, baked and even raw steaks from a dozen or more animals decorate the shop.  In the middle of the rear wall, a rhimar door seals off the cold storage area.  The counter itself is made from two great slabs of granite separated by a clear sheet of crystal.  The floor is freshly scrubbed, though a line of brown stains runs from the front door, behind the counter to the rhimar door."
