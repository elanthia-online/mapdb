      "Twisting through the floral forest, the trail picks a path around the enormous, conical blooms blossoming in every direction.  Rainbow ombre petals mirror the colors of the aurora-streaked sky, layered to form the giant inflorescences.  Whiskered with drooping tendrils, soaring black bat flowers interrupt the pastel hues like stygian ink splattered on a watercolor painting."
