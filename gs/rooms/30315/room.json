      "Set within an alcove off to one side of the odd little shop is a short built-in oak counter set with three small displays.  The scents of caramel, cinnamon, and chocolate blend together in the close confines of the space.  Flickering candles offer just enough illumination to reveal the unique boxes for sale here."
