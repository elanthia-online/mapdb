      "A hawk of ebony is perched atop a stand of the same material, its talons clutching the upper roll of a scroll scrawled with a list of names.  Other such scrolls are furled and sealed with wax, housed in niches honeycombing the walls.  The low ceiling is inlaid with a skull made from polished ivory, pristine save for a crack digging into its left temple."
