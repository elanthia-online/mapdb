      "The surroundings walls are patterned with deep crimson mahogany, their surfaces wrought with delicate, swirling patterns that flow with the grain of the wood.  A variety of comfortable chairs are placed near several large bay windows, while a pair of arched doors stand to the north.  Several low-lit hallways branch off to the east and west."
