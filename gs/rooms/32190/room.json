      "Overturned wooden crates have been fashioned into makeshift patio furniture, and a water-stained parasol harpooned in the middle of an empty wine barrel branded with strange markings.  Open-mouthed stone gargoyles which have been dislodged from their posts on the steep roof block off a small corner section of the walkway that has begun to sag.  Initials have been crudely carved into the side of the chimney and then partially covered over by blood red paint."
