      "Sloping downward in two different directions, the passageway walls are draped in fuzzy blue-green moss, lighting the way with their luminescence.  A massive, rusted iron safe with its door pried open sits in the corner and currently is home to some tiny, glowing toadstools.  A clamor can be heard from beyond the tunnel to the west."
