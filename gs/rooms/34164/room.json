      "The cavern's ceiling droops precipitously toward a narrow tunnel in the west.  Water drips from the jagged mouth in an even patter, giving the impression of a maw trailing drips of saliva.  A patch of small crystals sprouts from the ground near the aperture.  Murky yellow light flickers fitfully in the depths of the multifaceted gems, casting a winking luminescence over shallow pools of water occupying depressions in the rough ground."
