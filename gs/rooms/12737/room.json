      "A pair of columns lean heavily against each other, pulled from their original position and no longer supporting the ceiling.  Along the base of the wall, the floor has been punctured, allowing glimpses to the watery floor below.  Yellowed bone fragments occupy a cracked wooden box nestled among some of the smaller debris."
