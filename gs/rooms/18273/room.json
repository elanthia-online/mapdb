      "The slowly ascending landscape begins to give way to the incline of a magnificent mountain.  Though darkness enhances the ever present ethereal mist inhibiting a clear view, the shrouded image of the massive formation is somewhat discernable to the scrutinizing eye.  The distant glint of fireflies dancing among the shadows in the northern foothills creates pinpoints of faint light, while the surface of the river lazily moving northwest gleams wetly in the light of the moon.",
      "The slow ascent in the landscape is prevalent here as the dense jungle gives way to the gradual incline of a magnificent mountain.  Ethereal, overlaying mist inhibits a clear view, though the shrouded images of the massive formation are discernable to the scrutinizing eye.  The path of the river continues northwest despite the change in landscape, and glimpses of the foothills further north can be seen."
