    "description": [
      "Conifers give way to a veritable alpine oasis perched on the side of the mountain, where deposits of slate and granite rise to prominence toward rocky crags above.  Nestled atop a gently sloping grassy knoll, a rustic fel-framed chalet is afforded a grand view of the vista below, with tended flowerbeds cradling its perimeter.  Patches of sunlight gently dapple the tree-laden path behind a simple cedarwood bridge leading across the brook, while a woven trellis draped in flowering wisteria beckons eastward."
