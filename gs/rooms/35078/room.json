      "Prosperous businesses crowd the northern side of the street, patronized by a steady stream of seafarers and traders.  Sheltered by a bend in the city's outer wall is a vast monument of volcanic glass that has been worked with surpassing skill.  It takes the form of a three-headed serpent breaching through storm-tossed waves.  Gold, silver, and gems have been heaped in a basin at the base of the statue, where tallow candles flicker and smoke in the icy wind."
