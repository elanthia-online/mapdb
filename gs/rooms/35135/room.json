      "Ruling unchallenged over a great pinnacle of jutting stone at the plateau's highest point, the Ashka Krol flies cobalt blue banners, each embroidered with a clenched black fist.  The grand fortress's walls are hewn from dull black basalt, but obsidian knotwork inlay around the portcullis guarding the inner yard glints harshly in the daylight.  Lookouts along the embrasures watch the path leading toward the entrance, their glinting crossbows ever-trained on the scant flow of visitors and supplicants."
