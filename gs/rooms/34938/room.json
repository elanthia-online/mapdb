      "Kraken-wrought lanterns are scattered along the bamboo-framed pavilion, their long tentacles grasping at the crossbeams above an elongated banana leaf-covered table at the center of the room.  A variety of vert-colored sailcloth cushions are placed along the length of the table, the seating resting upon the woven mats set along the wood-planked floor.  Set below an imposing pirate flag is a ship-carved basin, the container filled by a series of bamboo tubes flowing into the glass bowl."
