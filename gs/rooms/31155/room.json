      "Thermal-heated water bubbles up out of the ground, filling a calcium-ringed pool with its steamy blue-green water and warming the air.  Vibrant yellow and fuchsia azaleas stretch their flower-laden limbs in all directions, while tiny snow star and pink witch hazel trees with tufted flowers spread their shade to the southeast.  A series of bright white boulders collects rust-hued lichen on their smooth faces."
