      "Black basalt knuckles punch seaward, their slick faces lacquered with brine and rime.  Icy swells heave against the point, breaking to spindrift that salts the air.  A carved totem, weathered until only flakes of paint are left on its surface, rises from a cleft in the rock, its grim faces stacked in storm-dark wood, whalebone tusks pegged into snarling mouths.  Wedged into the spaces between black stones, abandoned rods lean like tired old men, lines trailing in the water.  The air smells heavily of kelp."
