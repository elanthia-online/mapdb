      "More glass cases line the walls in this small room.  A few benches devoid of any cushioning serve as uncomfortable resting places for those waiting for an audience with the city guardsmen.  A heavy tanik door stenciled with a crescent moon over an eight-pointed star leads into an office, and on the opposite wall is a set of sturdy brass-bound oak doors.  A massive glaes portcullis leads into the prison proper, while a black basalt archway opens into the entry hall."
