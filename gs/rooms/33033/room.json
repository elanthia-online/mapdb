      "Golden linden boards stretch across the floor, filling the space between the whitewashed walls with their warm radiance.  Frosted globes shed their pale white light on the surroundings from their anchored spot in the roughly hewn ceiling.  A rhimar-lined steel storage locker sits in one corner, several river reed harvest baskets hung from the walls surrounding it, while a thick maple butcher's block sits in the center of the tidy space."
