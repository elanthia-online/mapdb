    "description": [
      "Playfully embedded amid colorful potted plants that create a verdant separation wall, a vine-covered trellis strung with myriad silver and gold chimes connects the garden niche to a nearby backyard.  Curved stone benches are arranged in rows, creating audience seating around the niche's foci of a tile-lined alabaster fountain sporting a sculpture of Cholen.  Sunlight intermittently slips through the foliage, producing a play of colors upon the fountain's water and painting the stone in kaleidoscopic hues."
