      "The rough, cobblestone street dead-ends a the copper-faced doors of the Tradesman's Gates of the Solhaven-Vornavis wall.  Far to the west, you can hear the bustling sounds of the North Market.  A group of travelers mills about, drifting through the gates or off to the distant market, while a Vornavis Baronial guard converses with each of them one by one.",
