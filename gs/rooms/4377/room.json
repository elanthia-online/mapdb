      "Entering the hushed calm of this cavern, the mild scent of oiled leather wafts on the breeze.  A round oak table with delicate gold scrollwork covering the top is set in the center of the room, upon which rests a beige vellum placard.  Underfoot is a soft brown bearhide rug, while two distinctly female suits of armor stand sentry at the back corners."
