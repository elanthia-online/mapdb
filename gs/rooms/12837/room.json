      "Alternating slabs of pale and deep green feldspar line the curling, tentacle-like extensions of the strand as they funnel out.  Two long but narrow, scarlet marble plant-holders are crowded with variants of colorful tropical blooms, their heavy fragrances mixing in an indefinable but cloying perfume.  Set on the four corners of each planter, squat jade censers emit steady streams of myrrh-scented smoke, while a lovely young woman attendant sprawls upon the ground nearby, keeping languid watch."
