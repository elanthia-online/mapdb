      "A large round mound of hand-packed snow partially blocks the pathway on the eastern side of the road.  Two smaller companion balls of ice and debris lie nearby, an unfinished snow creature left by children called home for a meal.  Two lumps of coal and a small stick protrude out of the smallest of the spheres to create a crude face."
