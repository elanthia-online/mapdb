    "description": [
      "A thicket of modwir trees surges along one edge of the road, creating a blanket of darkness to envelope the exteriors of a handful of shops.  Children run playfully along the store fronts, peeking into each colorful window display before moving on to the next one.  A muted tune hangs in the distance, originating from an elven minstrel perched upon the edge of a wrought-iron bench, politely thanking shoppers that toss coins into a jar at his feet."
