      "The smell of pungent incense dominates this room.  A globe hangs from the ceiling casting dim light over the room.  A small, hand-woven mat lies on the floor in front of a small shrine with two unlit candles atop it.  Several other mats lie rolled up next to a small wicker basket.  Standing in the corner is a simple wooden box."
