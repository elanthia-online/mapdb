      "Swirling water rushes between the edges of the small island and the tall, ragged crags of the Teeth of Charl.  Large clumps of dark green seaweed speckled with brownish-white foam clog the tiny pass making it impossible for boats, or even small animals, to traverse the space between the mountains and the ring of protective cliffs."
