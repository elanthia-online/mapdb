      "A splash of incongruous greenery beckons from one of the planters in the form of a single fruit tree.  The sapling is heavily encased in ice, and appears to have been frozen swiftly enough to preserve a semblance of life to its graceful branches and spade-like leaves.  Spindly fruits with skins that glitter like spun gold hang from the branches, tantalizing but trapped in their frosty shell."
