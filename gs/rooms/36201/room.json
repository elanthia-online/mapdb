      "Midnight blue wool walls hang in deep, even folds, the fabric thick and tightly woven.  Along the seams, subtle stitching creates faint geometric patterns, and the panels overlap slightly at intervals, adding texture and depth.  Bronze lanterns hang from the ridge and edges, and wooden-panel enclosures are strewn with bales of straw.  An archway draped with a dark woven curtain rises along one wall, while a narrow wooden walkway runs through the center."
