    "description": [
      "A circle of stunted trees surrounds what must be one of the largest oaks in the world.  The tree easily towers above the rest of the woods, its branches nearly lost to sight.  Empty torch holders rest near the base of the trunk, and a thick carpet of moss covers the enormous roots that spread everywhere.  A path leading out of the forest splits around the base of the gigantic tree, the forks curving out of sight.",
      "A gigantic oak rises out of the dark night, surrounded by a pool of flickering light.  Burning torches stand in holders set near the base of the trunk, throwing eerie shadows about as they flicker.  In the light provided by the torches a path can been seen encircling the tree, and a faint light can be seen from either side of the fork."
