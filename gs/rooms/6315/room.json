      "You are in a large glade, ringed by tall and majestic oaks.  At its farther end, two of these venerable trees stand entwined as a living symbol of two souls bonded in matrimony.  In the pale moonlight, the oaks almost look like lovers hugging, renewing their special bond.  A small rosewood altar is set before the large oak trees, and an arch of modwir pine and spruce boughs leads to a shady path.",
