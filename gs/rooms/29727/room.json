      "Dominated by a peaked roof and mottled walls, the shop has a floor of overlapping rugs in a grass green hue bordered with goldenrod yellow flowers.  Dangling orbs of frosted glaes fill the space with a soft light that is ample enough to view the wares that are stored in a nearby oak bookcase.  Though the light does not fully reach a long oak table surrounded by river reed baskets, it still provides enough illumination to read the vellums found on and within them."
