      "The var passes between two large buildings, the Ta'Illistim Theatre to the south and the Public Library to the northwest.  To either side of the grand structures, you see a number of small but comfortable cottages that seem to be home to a community of young scholars and artists.  In the doorway of one cottage, two black-robed young elves engage in a heated debate over what is likely some obscure point of philosophy.",
      "The var passes between two large buildings, the Ta'Illistim Theatre to the south and the Library Aies to the northwest.  To either side of the grand structures are a number of small but comfortable domiciles that seem to be home to a community of scholars and artists, if the piles of books and the random bits of unfinished sculpture on the doorsteps are any kind of indication.  A small shop, converted from an older home, fits right in on the street."
