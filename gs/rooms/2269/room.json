      "In an apparent attempt to keep the weight of the noble Stormbrow from collapsing the shaft, several logs have been driven into the walls, with a few placed upright to support the ceiling.  Considering the piles of rocks and debris scattered about, this was probably the only thing that kept the tunnel from closing off completely years ago."
