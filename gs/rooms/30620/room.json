      "Circular in shape, close-fitting brick forms the walls of the room creating the foundation of the lighthouse proper.  Light from a warped, stained-glass window bathes the space in beams of bright colors.  Set back from the entrance is a polished mahogany desk with bits of shell inlaid along the edges.  A spiraling staircase leads up into the tall building."
