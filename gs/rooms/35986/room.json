      "Muted light accompanies a peaceful silence throughout the room.  Despite being simple and relatively unfurnished, it still looks comfortable.  A deceptively large modwir bed stands near the window, covered in pillows, with a bookcase nearby.  The stone floor is bare except for a large polar bear skin at the foot of the bed.  Heat radiates from the fireplace set in the wall below an exquisite banner."
