      "A rank odor, seemingly the combination of decaying flesh and tanning solution, wafts from the piles of animal skins stacked about the room.  Makeshift torches set a flickering glow against the crumbling cavern walls, as dwarven workers filter in and out of the area with supplies.  In the center of the room is a long wooden workbench strewn with tools and various tarnished metal objects."
