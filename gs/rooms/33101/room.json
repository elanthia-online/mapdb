      "Several cots line the room beneath detailed murals of various ship battles with body-strewn decks.  Each mural depicts a dwarven cleric walking cheerfully through the carnage.  The floors are scuffed and splattered with crimson stains, which are only partially obscured by various potted herbs.  A dusty cabinet is filled with chrism gems, white flasks, and obscure paraphernalia."
