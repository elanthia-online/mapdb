      "Stretching beneath a canopy of woven fabric, the gemstone stall spills across a low table covered in raw and cut stones.  Rough-hewn slabs rest along one side, their crystalline structures glinting at the fractured edges.  A velvet-lined tray displays finely cut gems, their facets scattering light in sharp flashes.  Loose strands of beads dangle from wooden stands, their colors shifting with the slightest motion.  Along the outer posts, knotted ropes secure the stall against the chance of wind."
