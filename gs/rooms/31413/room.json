      "An orange glow illuminates the area despite the lingering smoky haze that hangs in the air.  Occupying the southern wall is the source of that glow: a small forge under a large black vent that funnels smoke out through the domed ceiling's apex.  Sooty tables face the wall in a row, each with bins full of dirty sand underneath.  The sound of heavy footsteps accompanies a steel golem as it moves about performing menial tasks."
