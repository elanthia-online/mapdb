      "The brisk, icy air slips through the spike-tied canvas flaps of the tent, the dark fabric brushing against the trays set on nearby pedestals.  A pot-bellied stove of blackened iron stands at the back corner of the crate-walled room, the various pots and pans hanging above and interspersed by bundles of dried tobacco.  A clockwork basin of pipes and cogs loft an herb-filled box between the jar-filled shelves flanking the corners."
