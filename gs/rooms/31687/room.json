      "Propped more against the split rail fence than supported by its own stake is a rather handsome scarecrow as scarecrows go.  Its sackcloth face appears freshly painted, its flannel shirt stuffed with fresh straw, and its hat rakishly tilted so that one black eye peers out from beneath the floppy leather brim.  Leaves have fallen to rest on its shoulders, with some stuck in the longer stems of its straw stuffing."
