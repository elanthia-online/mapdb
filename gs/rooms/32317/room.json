    "description": [
      "A distributary of the Olbin laps at the shores of a small meadow that is dusted with snowfall.  Ice clings to the high grasses and glitters like a scattering of jewels over the wildflowers that have somehow managed to thrive in the strath's limited protection from the cold.  The ground is sodden rather than frozen, as if the river is occasionally discontent to stay within its appointed bounds."
