    "description": [
      "Several deep pools comprise this section of the stream, fed by a series of small waterfalls, and cinchona trees hold the greater trees at bay, creating a glade filled with an abundance of plants and flowers.  Colorful gingers, both torch and shell, commingle with bellflowers, jasmine, and starclusters.  Burgundy-tinged ti plants gather about the pools' edges, and vines drape across the top of the downstream waterfall.  Upstream, the trail has been blocked off, a carved sign placed along the teak blockade."
