      "Elaborate ivory cornice moulding and an equally ornamented chair railing adorn the entire upper and lower perimeter of the shop and add an unabashed elegance to the showroom.  Displayed along a hard rock wall in an eye-catching arrangement is an extensive collection of musical instruments, each in varying stages of wear.  Positioned at one end of a long mahogany table is a gold-trimmed mahogany bucket, while a mahogany podium flanks the other end, the auctioneer standing attentively behind."
