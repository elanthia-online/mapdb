      "The inside of this cheerfully appointed wagon is surprisingly spacious.  The walls are painted a pale goldenrod and artfully decorated with framed paintings, in various sizes, of bucolic landscapes.  The sweet smell of fresh-cut flowers suffuses the wagon, mingling with the robust fragrance of various aromatic teas wafting deliciously on the air.  Small tables dressed in fine linen, set with silver, and hosting elegantly carved wooden chairs, are carefully situated in the middle of the space."
