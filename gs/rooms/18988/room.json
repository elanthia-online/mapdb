      "Lacking any luminescent fungi, the only illumination comes from the cavern walls that are densely covered with glowing moss in shades of blue, green, and occasionally, crimson.  The less intense light casts a complex pattern of subtle, crisscrossing shadows upon the rock floor from the stalactite and stalagmite formations.  Several branching paths have been outlined in glassy, reflective stones."
