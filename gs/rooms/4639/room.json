      "Twin towers stand as sentinels to a vaulted archway leading out to the town common.  The adjoining, thick stone walls extend to encircle a grassy bailey, until they butt up against the stony face of the granite mountainside.  Protected within this small fortress are a rustic wooden hostelry and the grey granite facade of the bank.",
      "Twin towers stand as sentinels to a vaulted archway leading out to the town common.  Across from the bank is a pale stone gate that gives entrance to a corral near the wooden hostelry."
