    "description": [
      "The small domed shrine is comprised of hewn blocks of river stone.  Pine tar between the narrow cracks keeps out the worst of the ubiquitous chill, but it lends the air an acrid bite that overpowers the odor of the dozens of tallow candles warming and lighting the chamber.  They illuminate a large effigy on the rear wall of the shrine that sits atop a black block of stone veined with silver.  Carved from a single great whale bone, it depicts a woman with sorrowful eyes holding a set of ornate keys."
