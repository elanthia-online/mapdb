      "This round room is well lit with a blazing brass chandelier hovering high above a reflective polished marble floor.  Lacquered wood paneling extends along the ceiling and down the walls, provoking an atmosphere of austerity.  Plush velvet-cushioned mahogany chairs have been arranged around the edges of the room to provide seats for spectators.  A plaque in iron framework has been placed by the arch, and a deep circular groove in the marble floor designates a siegery battle area in the center of the room."
