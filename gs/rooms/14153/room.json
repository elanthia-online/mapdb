      "The stillness here is eerie.  The walls and floor are composed of highly polished brass reflecting upon itself and playing tricks with your eyes.  In the center of the room stands an ornately carved brass bracket, supporting a perfect silver sphere.  This does not seem like that type of place one would want to be caught by the monks."
