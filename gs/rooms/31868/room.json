      "Barely visible behind large drifts of cold-hardened snow, a frozen lake glitters in the ambient light.  A large riverstone manor sits on a small rise, surrounded by several outbuildings, and the cobblestone path ends abruptly at a foreboding thicket of trees and briars.  Several twisting trails lead behind the manor to additional buildings."
