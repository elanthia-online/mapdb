      "Flanked by stark white travertine pillars, charcoal grey planks form a walkway along the shoreline as they connect a sprawling pier system to the mainland.  Tide pools filled with colorful sea anemones and small fish dot the area, providing a glimpse into the vibrant underwater world.  Crowning nearby cliffs, a pageantry of verdant greenery sways in the seaside breeze."
