      "Trailing in from the west, a bright white lattice stretches to the ceiling and is held in place by ties to the central support of the tent.  Metallic hooks and rough oak pegs are affixed to the structure, which forms a sort of wall that separates the center of the space from this section.  Placed against the exterior canvas tent wall, a low round table topped with wares is illuminated by a lantern that sits in its center."
