      "The large room seems to be in some sort of organized chaos.  Disheveled cooks with dirty aprons bustle about, some putting and some taking things off the wooden island counter in the center of the room.  A service table designated for ready-to-go trays of food sits next to a winding metal staircase that leads upstairs."
