      "Hardly more than a narrow alcove, this cramped space is almost entirely taken up by a battered oak closet along one wall and a dented steel dust bin at the far end.  Emanating from a narrow cleft at the end of the alcove, the soft stirring of wings and high-pitched squeaks overhead suggest that a small colony of bats has taken up residence."
