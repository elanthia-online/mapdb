      "Dozens of windchimes hang from the splayed branches of the tall, foliage-bare trees, the murals upon their carved trunks faded by the elements.  Sporadic melodies rise from the hollowed lengths of bamboo, sea glass discs, and aged brass bells as the occasional breeze ripples the surface of the nearby pond.  Stitched with symbols of the Great Houses, silken banners hang from gnarled driftwood poles buried alongside thin benches offering places to rest and reminisce."
