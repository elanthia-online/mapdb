      "The tattered remains of an ancient banner hang from two of the skull crenellations on the outer wall.  The strips of cloth move not at all in the utter stillness of the night.  A jumbled pile of bones to one side may once have been a skeleton, though it's impossible to tell what creature the bones might have belonged to due to the presence of three skulls.",
