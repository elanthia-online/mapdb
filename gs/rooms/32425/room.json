      "Mountain ash trees lean over the roadside, heavy with clusters of bright red berries.  They shadow the wreckage of a cleric's shop set back from the street, protected from prying eyes by high hedges.  Heavy doors of elm bear the scars of axe blows and the windows are shattered, but a barricade on the other side blocks entry."
