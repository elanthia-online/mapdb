      "Droves of the dead lie in niches along the walls.  Weapons interred with them have turned to dust and rust, but still the desiccated corpses lie, wasted fingers clenched around the splintered remains.  The head of a huge metal greataxe, somehow spared the ravages of time, lies in the middle of the path, its edges notched and dull."
