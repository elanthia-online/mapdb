      "The trail wanders through an area devoid of undergrowth, meandering around and through a maze of thick buttress roots at the base of the trees.  The roots create a fanciful landscape in the darkness, gnarled and tangled into formations that adhere to flights of fancy more fitting to illusion than logic.  Here and there, orchids cling to the trees, their ostentatious blooms swaying in the moonlight on reed-like stems.",
