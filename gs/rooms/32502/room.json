      "Dark wooden posts support the high ceiling of the exchange hall, which houses several wooden tables and chairs, many arranged in circles to offer plenty of space to allow conversations and trade to occur.  Heavy brocade curtains are pulled back along each wall to provide just enough light to seep in through a collection of large glass windows.  The wooden floor has lost its polish and is now marred by countless scuff marks from boots."
