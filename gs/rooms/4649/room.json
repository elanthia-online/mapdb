      "Fragrant wisteria coils around the white-washed latticework that has been suspended as the ceiling, from which dangles several of the smaller wares for sale.  Stocked shelves are festooned with garlands of lilies and roses, while lovely bouquets sit upon display tables.  An antique rocking chair with a throw blanket folded over one arm rests cozily beside a simple carved stand."
