      "The pier extends over the aquamarine waters, its charcoal grey planks connected by white travertine pillars.  A row of smoking and illuminated copper lanterns hangs from the pillars, their glass panels fogged with salt spray.  Beneath the pier, schools of silver fish dart through the clear water, creating shadows that stretch and shrink with the tide."
