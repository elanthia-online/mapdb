      "The crystalline white walls shed their light upon a dark marble floor, both hues echoed in the marbled arch that separates the foyer from the main tower.  Grand arches stretch across the foyer, one bearing a chiseled inscription.  Next to a long hallway that leads towards the ballroom, a doorless closet holds snow-soaked outer garments and muddy footwear.  A number of lounges provide seating to enjoy the ambiance."
