      "Off-white canvas splattered with varied pigments form the walls and high ceiling of the labyrinthine pavilion which is illuminated by dusky orbs that shed flickering multicolored lights.  Thick carpets stave off the cold of the festival grounds, though a light breeze does trickle in beneath the unbound ends of the tent's flaps.  Plain and unassuming, a small bookcase lined with art-covered shelves rests against the western wall."
