      "An antique wall hanging hangs on one of the smooth sandstone walls, and a painted nightscape ceiling rises overhead.  Some potted luminescent toadstools sits in one corner of a solid plank ebonwood floor.  There is a iron-bound ebonwood chest on one side of the shop and a twisted dark metal rack on the other."
