      "Overhead, the flaring overhang of the manor's roof shelters half of this sprawling balcony, including a broad mahogany bar, from the depredations of weather and the drifting mist of the nearby Cascade of Tears.  The semicircular floor is a mosaic of irregularly shaped blue and green tiles arranged in a loose spiral and bound to the north by the curve of a low stone balustrade.  Below, flowers bloom amidst the verdant foliage of a garden perched at the water's edge."
