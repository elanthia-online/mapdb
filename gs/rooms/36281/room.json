      "Hanging upon the black walls, wooden shadow boxes are illuminated from within by thin rods of glowing blown glass.  White pine curios occupy the four corners, their tops covered in large earthen pots of glossy blue and teeming with ivy plants whose gangling limbs are coaxed into tiny hooks that encircle the room at ceiling level.  A thin runner of mingled blue and green knotwork leads to an exterior door."
