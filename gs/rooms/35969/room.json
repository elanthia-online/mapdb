      "From beyond the surrounding shrub brush comes the low murmur of a brook, its waters moving unseen but steady, a hidden current threading through the forest.  Trees rise thick around the path, their canopy sealing off the sky until the wind sighs and lets slip streaks of azure, violet, and coral light.  A pale ring of mushrooms rims the track's edge, their caps glistening in the dimness.  Beside them towers an ancient tree, its limbs trailing with grandpa's beard moss that sways in the shifting air."
