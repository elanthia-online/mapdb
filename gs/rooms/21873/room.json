      "Sheathed with oak planking, the walls and floor give the room a rustic, yet purposeful air.  Each wall contains a double door leading to other areas of the keep, while hanging from high above are several large tapestries.  Well lit by oil-lamps dangling from the rafters, the chamber prominently displays a giant banner stretched over the southern doorway."
