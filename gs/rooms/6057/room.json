      "The corn stalks sweep southward to avoid a cluster of large rocks.  A huge boulder, twenty feet wide and equally high, holds sway in the soft soil and weeds.  Around it cluster eight smaller boulders, large in their own right, but dwarfed by the giant they surround.  They wait patiently, as they have probably waited for hundreds, even thousands of years, for a word of advice from the larger, obviously more successful boulder."
