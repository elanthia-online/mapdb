      "Climbing into the hills that mark the southern end of the river valley, the pathway is a balding stretch of cobblestone being devoured by mosses and grass, but it widens into a full road as it climbs southward.  Through the elms crowding in from the northwest, the waters of the Frostmain are visible, choked heavily with silvery mist transformed into glowing clouds by the starlight."
