      "A faint, constant chittering sound seems to emanate from the huge mound of reddish earth and dried mud that towers above you, and now and then a small rock or clump of dried mud tumbles down the side of the steep slope as if something moving above has knocked it down.  The scrub brush and wild stalks of wheat grow more sparsely here, half-buried in piles of dirt and stones, and a sour, burnt odor fills the air.",
