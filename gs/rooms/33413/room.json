      "Leaving the cliffs of Kraken's Fall behind, the landscape transitions from tall grasses and beach vines to rolling dunes and is pockmarked with large greyish white boulders.  Small tidal pools along the western edges are fed directly from the lapping ocean, while nearer at hand a pale, sand-smoothed boardwalk connects pebble walkways to the area's small houses.  An incline of smooth steps provides access to a flat plain that overlooks the beach."
