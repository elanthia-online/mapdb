    "description": [
      "Foot-wide blocks of ice are neatly stacked to form makeshift walls around a small rocky area at the edge of the seaside cove.  Vibrant blue hues of the bay's water bleed through the nearly translucent ice perimeter, and frequent gusts of brisk air from the ocean causes a string of multicolored flags to flap relentlessly against its fury.  A burly sailor dressed in blue and white stands behind a large rock-carved table displaying a basket of chisels."
