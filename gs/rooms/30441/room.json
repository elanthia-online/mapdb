      "Charl's Teeth, menacing in their volcanic majesty, rise ever skyward to the west.  Torrents of water tear through the narrow crevices in the black obsidian barrier, and waves of enormous height pound relentlessly against the unseen side of those cliffs, the excess of the deluge cascading down over the rock face on this side.  Trembling with constant movement, the teal-into-blue water heaves easterly toward the outer shore of the encircled island."
