A cleared walkway has been made through the center of the room, flanked on both sides by workbenches and coffee tables, each with its own individual look.  Along the southern wall, a collection of blueprints has been pinned to the aqua-striped wallpaper, each diagram giving detailed instructions of table construction.",
