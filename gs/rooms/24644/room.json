    "description": [
      "Dappled moonlight illuminates the spacious courtyard of an elegant, two-story mist grey manor.  Cultivated beds of ivory stargazer lilies line the cobblestone walkway from the base of a gracefully arched gate to the ebonwood doors of the manor.  A sweeping expanse of ancient willow trees dots the landscape, their drooping boughs shadowing several scroll-worked marble benches.  A series of granite stepping stones winds around the side of the grounds."
