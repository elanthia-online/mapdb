      "A carved, wooden rolton has been nailed to the center of this otherwise unadorned rectangular table.  The rolton is foaming at the mouth and a frozen snarl dominates the small wooden face.  The carving is so poorly done that the rolton is only barely identifiable.  Wooden chairs sized for all races surround the table."
