      "This small, natural niche in the dense wood is outlined by a series of small square hay bales and tree limbs bedecked in strands of bright vellum luminaries.  A few larger pendant lanterns with patterned glass shades cast geometric shapes on the leaf-covered ground, making the fallen colors glow in the light."
