      "Deep gold draperies edged in royal blue line the walls keeping any outside light from reaching within.  Several carefully placed sconces and candelabras fully illuminate the room, leaving no shadows and creating an ideal space for showcasing the array of wares filling the various tables and display cases.  A swirling green vortex churns between the oddly extended and bent sides of a sturdy cedar weapon stand and a cedar weapon rack, placed in such a way that the two points of each meet at an apex in the middle to contain the anomaly."
