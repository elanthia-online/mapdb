      "This spacious room houses a myriad of effects used to prepare for a theatrical production.  Costumes, makeup, and other accouterments of the profession lay in various levels of organization around the area.  The back wall is occupied by a large wardrobe, on either side of which hang faded handbills, highlighting theatrical productions of years gone by.  A burgundy velvet curtain leads back to the stage."
