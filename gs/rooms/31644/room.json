      "A black-lacquered desk dominates the center of the room, its legs carved in skeletal forms of avians both large and small.  An armor-clad warrior portrait looms behind the leather-backed chair, a trail of brittle cobwebs connecting the two in a drape of dust and bits of feathers.  Flanking the stained bureau are wooden racks filled with bottles of viscous fluid, their slender vellum labels faded from exposure to the curtainless windows, leaving the contents to congeal in oddly shaped forms."
