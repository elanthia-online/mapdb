    "description": [
      "The Mageborn's bow rises in splintered ruin, its fractured timbers jutting sharply above the grasping surf.  Rusted metal bindings cling stubbornly to weathered wood, leaving trails the color of dried blood down the faded and flaking blue paint.  Relentless waves crash against the hull, spraying seafoam onto the salt-crusted features of a battered figurehead in the form of a woman with a proud countenance and ringleted hair.  The hull below is shattered, allowing the ocean into the ship's forward hold."
