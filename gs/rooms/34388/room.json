    "description": [
      "A thick-cut pine log palisade surrounds the courtyard, meeting at a large open gate.  A hitching post sits near the entrance of the enclosure, flanked by fresh hay bales and a water trough.  A large hand-carved black marble bowl rests on a polished steel pedestal in the center of the courtyard, a ring of birdseed hulls littering the snow beneath the bowl.  Off to one side, a small round table sits in a relatively protected area.  Unlit torches line a snow-edged pathway from the entrance to a rose-carved ironwood entryway with a pair of sturdy double doors."
