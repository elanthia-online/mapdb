      "A heavy layer of squishy silt has accumulated in this area of the tunnel, forced in by the continual lapping action of the stream just to the east.  The silt grasps at feet and legs, attempting to immobilize anything that has the audacity to try to pass through it, and it only seems to get thicker to the northwest. Although the emerald water covers the silt in this area, the thin layer casts very little light, making it difficult to see well more than a few yards in any direction."
