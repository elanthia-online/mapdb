      "Cleanly hewn and polished walls of sandy marble enclose the room, trimmed with boxy patterns of carved knotwork.  A detailed circle of runes dominates the center of the floor, worked in pearlescent white tile amongst the greater pattern of wispy cloud patterns.  Tightly rolled sheaves of paper peek out from small niches in the numerous scroll racks that line the marble walls."
