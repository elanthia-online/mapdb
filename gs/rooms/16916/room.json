      "Set deep into the back of the mine, the office of the Warden is marked by a large portrait of himself and polished gems set deep into the walls of the room.  A long oak desk is covered with various papers, and tall quills are placed carefully in the holders.  To the right of the desk, a large keg of ale is within reach of the warden, while a huge mug sits on top of the desk."
