    "description": [
      "A wide gallery curves in a gentle crescent, following the southern wall of the cavernous hall.  Its northern edge stretches out over a vast chasm that plummets into unleavened darkness, but a masterfully carved railing of hoarbeam stands between the unwary and the pit.  A pathway is formed of cubed cerulean glaes set into the black stone of the gallery walk, intricate golden inlay forming a border between the two.  The stonework is exceptional in its detail and evenness."
