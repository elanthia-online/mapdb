      "A long counter extends from the north wall nearly to the south wall, splitting the room neatly in half.  Two large stone pots, one on either side of the counter, house luminescent toadstools, their glowing caps providing ample light by which to conduct trade.  Behind the counter a smiling dwarf goes about the business of opening boxes, creating lockpicks, and cheerfully helping customers.  A metal work table abuts the west wall, behind the counter, and a sign resides on the counter."
