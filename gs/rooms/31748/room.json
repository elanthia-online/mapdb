      "A series of dripping candle-laden chandeliers illuminate a variety of oil paintings lining a long walnut-paneled hallway.  Plush carpet runners in wine-dark hues muffle footsteps on the gleaming hardwood floors outside of closed doors, some with notices hanging on the burnished brass handles.   A brass trolley cart stacked with luggage waits in an alcove at the end of the hall."
