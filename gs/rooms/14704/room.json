      "A large geyser pool dominates the area to the west, with vivid stripes of muted colors radiating out from the deep blue of the water in complex patterns.  Small puddles have collected within indentions in the rock, and they sparkle in the sunlight like jewels.  The flat vista stretches out in all directions with nary a plant in sight, other than the jungle gathered at the perimeter of the geyser flats like an attentive audience.",
