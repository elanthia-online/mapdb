      "Dozens of hand-sketched silhouettes cover the velvet-draped walls of the shop, the sheets of pale vellum drawn in vibrant images of gowns encircled by calligraphic notations.  Faenor-wired mannequins are posed before an ivy-carved resaeun display, the quartet bedecked in custom-tailored pieces and intricate footwear.  Framed by twin vases of glazed porcelain stands a ceiling-high mirror, the reflection creating the illusion of a much larger interior, the looking glass suspending garlands of parchment flora."
