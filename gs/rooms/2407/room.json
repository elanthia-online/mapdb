      "Arms slung casually over one another's shoulders, a group of halflings enters the Thirsty Penguin.  A mother cat rests on the broad stone step, consenting to the occasional caress but flicking her tail in warning at the approach of strangers.  From beyond the swinging doors come the sounds of clinking mugs and hearty laughter.",
