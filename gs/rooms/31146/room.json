      "Juniper bushes stretch across the northern edge, the blue-berried foliage providing a natural barrier between a sinuous pathway that heads in a southerly direction and the edge of the cliff.  Vinca drapes in a curtain of periwinkle flowers over the mouth of a cave, while spongy sheet moss grows between the loose stones that dot the ground.  A dormant lantern hangs from a large iron ring that is conveniently hammered into the granite wall."
