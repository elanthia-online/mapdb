      "Piles of modwir cases are displayed about the small room, their insides lined with soft velvet to cushion the various treasures nestled within.  Several glass boxes show off a wide variety of curiosities through clear panes.  Although the containers are organized haphazardly, a pair of attendants seems to know exactly where each requested item is."
