      "A pair of cast iron sconces hangs on one of the paneled mahogany walls, and a steeply angled ceiling rises overhead.  A worn rug sits in one corner of an ornate ceramic tile floor.  There is a clawfooted cherrywood table on one side of the shop and a floral-etched ceramic case on the other."
