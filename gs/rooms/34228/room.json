    "description": [
      "Spun cocoons the color of rust and mustard hang pendulously from the walls, supported by ropy, mucilaginous webbing in the same ugly hues.  They throb and twitch spasmodically, bulging grotesquely in places.  Several spent casings lie discarded nearby, shriveled but unable to dry entirely in the moist environment.  Intensely warm and heavy, the air is heavy-laden with a sour vinegar stink that clashes revoltingly with the earthier odor of mildew."
