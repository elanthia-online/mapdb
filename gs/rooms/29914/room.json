      "A boundless flame roars from the vastness of a chasm running parallel with the eastern wall of the longhouse, the lowest verges of which are lost beyond sight.  Riotous in hue, the flames have blackened the timbers above, and their heat has left the stone brick hearth behind them pocked and dark.  Buckets full of sweet-smelling herbs burn in the fire, belching thick smoke with a cloying, honeyed aroma."
