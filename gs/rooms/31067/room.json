      "Climbing up higher, the trail winds its way up the mountainous terrain.  The pine and fir trees scattered about the rocky pass sway slightly as the wind picks up noticeably, chilling the air.  Piles of stone and dirt are scattered about bits of rock and boulders that line the narrow path.   Here and there, bits of sparce greenery try to etch out a place in the harsh environment."
