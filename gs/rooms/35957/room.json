      "Moonlight spills through muntined windows across black slate tiles, catching on brass fittings and the curve of a great hearth set with a cast iron stove.  At the center, a dining table of polished blackwood is set with silver candlesticks and a simple arrangement of aurora marigolds, while four bourde-upholstered chairs wait neatly around it.  Walnut cupboards line the room, displaying fine porcelain dishes and crystal jars filled with a variety of spices."
