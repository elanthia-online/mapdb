      "Nestled against the bright white wrought iron railing, a small table of filigreed metal is flanked by blue-cushioned chairs with high backs.  Fragrant bee balm, sweet marjoram, and sage grow in wide profusion along the cliff edge that resides just beyond the railing, the thick vegetation providing a verdant foreground to the ocean view.  Filling the air with its lyrical chorus, the sound of the fountain to the south trickles in."
