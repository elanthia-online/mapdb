      "The paneled hallway ends at an oak doorway, above which is a sign in the shape of a bulging pouch of coins.  A tapestry adorns the north wall, showing a fleet of ships, apparently heavy-laden, approaching a sprawling harbor town.  The light from the brass lanterns highlights the rich colors of the tapestry, practically bringing the scene to life before your eyes."
