      "Aglisten with a fresh coat of polish, a wide spruce bar with ko'nag accents runs along the far wall of the mead hall.  Behind it are fat casks full of mead, the heady odor of honey and alcohol rising from them to fill the capacious space.  High tables are arranged about the room in a rough semicircle, encircled by outsized stools comprised of wood and thick leather."
