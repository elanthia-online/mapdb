      "Glossy ebonwood floors stretch out from the door and across the room, with matching furniture that sits against walls with forest green, satin-sheened paper with an upper edging of onyx vines near the crown molding.  Ahead and slightly to the right is a satin cord-barred staircase, while a heavy ebonwood door has been placed beneath the railing on the side of the staircase.  To the left of the entrance is a wide ebonwood arch adorned with silver-drawn violet silk curtains that leads into a study, and another archway at the rear of the foyer offers a view of what must be a formal dining room."
