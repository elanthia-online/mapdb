      "The lacquered floor has been fashioned from a mixture of parqueted light and dark wood.  A freestanding desk in the center of the room has a long-haired elven woman behind it.  Against the left wall is a stockpile of wooden crates stamped in black with a logo of crossed laces.  A colossal bronze sign hangs above the grand archway, which leads to an illuminated hallway."
