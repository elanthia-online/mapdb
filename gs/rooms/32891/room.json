      "Crumbled bits of the Old Ward Wall scatter across the cobblestoned thoroughfare as its body was obliterated in the past due to a downed palm tree.  The wide body still rests across the rent in the barrier, though its trunk has been largely sawed and sections of it removed.  Curving between the backs of shop buildings, a narrow alley slips deeper into the town, while a nearly pristine road tracks westward."
