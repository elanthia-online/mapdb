      "Starlight filters through arched panes of glass, illuminating draped verdant tendrils with a silvery glow.  Shelves of potted herbs cast faint shadows on the ground, while vines along wrought iron supports form intricate, moonlit patterns.  Wide wooden tables hold neat arrangements of jars, tools, and drying plants, their surfaces softly shimmering under the starlight.  A subtle scent of soil and blossoms lingers, blending with the cool night air.  Shrouded by curtains, a glass-paned door leads deeper inside."
