      "The modestly elegant walls of this oak panelled room are lined with shelves holding leatherbound tomes of Dhe'nar history and magic.  Two stuffed chairs sit in front of a large stone fireplace, logs and kindling neatly stacked beside them.  The flames of a fire happily burn in the hearth.  A carved oak bed sits in the corner, covered with a quilted spread and edged with faint runes of ancient Dhe'nar legend.  A large window frames a massive oak desk whose legs are carved in the likeness of great drakes."
