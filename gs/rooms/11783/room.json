      "A few beams of sunlight have managed to break through the tree cover and their glittering reflection can be seen dancing upon the dark waters of the swamp.  The marsh-dwellers have set up a platform for fishing, and one would suspect they bring in a good haul of catfish and mudpuppies from time to time.  A rusted tin bucket has been firmly bolted to the wood to hold the day's catch.",
