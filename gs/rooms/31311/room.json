      "Gossamer swathes enclose the teak pavilion with an ethereal rainbow of sheer fabrics that gently flutter under the coercion of a delicate breeze.  Cushioned by flyrsilk pillows with a bold hibiscus motif, a collection of rattan chairs is cozily nestled in one corner.  Alexandrite vines twine around the wiry legs of an aureate teacart set before the backdrop of a vellum-paneled divider painted with blue macaws."
