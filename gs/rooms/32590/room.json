      "Flanked by folded shutters, wide-open windows devoid of glass allow the tropical air to filter through the small storefront that is illuminated by the warm starlight.  Smooth oak floors support a wide glass-fronted counter, while dark pine and teak planks cover the walls where a series of shelves are anchored by wrought iron supports.  The keel of a small sailing vessel has been cleaved in twain to form the exiting archway."
