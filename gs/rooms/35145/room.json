      "Garlands of dried herbs and flowers are hung at intervals across the cross-beamed ceiling, scenting the fur and pelt-covered walls nestled with long canvas cots.  A petrified wooden cabinet stands angled away from a small pot-bellied stove, the straw-lined container filled with rolls of fresh bandages and poultice-filled jars set beside a stone mortar and pestle.  Reed-woven hampers are set alongside the cots, filled to the brim with clean linens and wool blankets folded in neat stacks."
