      "Large chunks of the same limestone as the cliffs to the north tumble over each other to the southeast, thrusting a protective arm around the harbor.  Waves break against the weathered ivory of the jetty's surface, and a lone lantern flickers in the darkness of night, casting its pallid light over the rolling surf."
