      "Dwarven miners wander in and out of the stone arch to the south.  Those proceeding north are dusty and grimy, their faces covered by a layer of sweaty dirt and their beards tangled.  In contrast, those proceeding south are clean and neat, with washed faces and combed beards.  The tunnel to the south appears to be tighter, of much rougher construction than the surrounding area, and also poorly lit.  The dwarves moving in and out seem to pay no attention to the change in construction."
