    "description": [
      "Rough oak floorboards form a small, squarish landing that encircles a rickety set of wooden stairs that descends to the level below.  Whitewashed walls, newly painted and clean, lend a sterile and austere air to the small space that is only enhanced by the scent of medicinals in the air.  Wrought iron hooks flank a closed white door, their curved edges supporting various overcoats and smocks."
