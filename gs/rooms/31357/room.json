      "Large portrait windows on three sides of this room allow for plenty of natural light, which illuminates an oval wooden table with padded chairs, a long counter with a white ivory basin at one end, and a tall white cupboard.  The faint scents of cinnamon and sugar hang in the air, remnants of previous culinary experiences."
