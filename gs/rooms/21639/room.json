      "Two staircases cross here, one set of steps upwards and one down.  The cramped space smells faintly of food and sweat and the passing of many people.  A mural runs across what would otherwise be a featureless wall at the back of the landing.  A thick iron door leads into a salle, while through a large open arch rows of tables and benches are visible."
