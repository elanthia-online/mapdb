      "An imposing statue of white marble stands to the side of the flagstone path proceeding through the castle ward.  It depicts a man of powerful build, armored in chainmail, as he menaces a huge striking serpent with a blade.  The eyes of the man have been gouged out, and chunks of white stone litter the surrounding grasses.  Nearby lies a bent pickaxe that appears to have been the vandal's weapon of choice."
