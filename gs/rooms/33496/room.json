      "Pennants placed every few feet along a widening muddy track provide a colorful escort to a pair of viewing stands on opposing sides of a sodded racing track.  Centrally located, a sky blue and white-striped pavilion buzzes with activity as jockeys prepare for upcoming races.  A supply cart pulled by a team of stout ponies is unloaded of its burden near the entrance."
