      "Jet black stones, blasted smooth by the constant force of the ice and snow, rise out of the frozen landscape.  Charred, frozen hunks of coal sit in the lee of one of the great stones.  They once served to cook a traveler's tiny meal, now held captive by a sheet of clear ice.  The rocks bear chip marks at their base, telling a tale of a desperate attempt to gain freedom from the arctic cold."
