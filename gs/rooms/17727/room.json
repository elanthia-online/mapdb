      "Sunlight intrudes easily between the warped boards and roof slates of this shack to illuminate various medical items, a good thing because the windows are so grimy as to be almost opaque.  A mannequin leans against a corner with nearly its whole figure swathed in bandages.  Against the far wall an assortment of cabinets hold medicinal ingredients of various shapes, sizes and potencies.  Several cots in remarkably clean condition occupy spaces here and there, and a ladder drops into depths unseen.",
