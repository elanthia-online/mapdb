      "The forest is bright and airy here.  Travel is easy and passage is possible in several directions.  To the south lies a large open meadow, while the path to the southwest climbs a gentle slope winding between white birches.  The ground seems to level off to both the north and east, with several majestic oak trees towering to the east.  The sound of running water can be heard near at hand.",
