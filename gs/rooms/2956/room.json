      "The gallery bends at an oak-framed maple door in the eastern wall, continuing to the southeast toward a wide marble-arched opening that leads into a chamber that smells of preservatives and old parchment.  Jewel-toned stained glass panes wink from the windows along the southern wall, letting in moonlight but mostly repelling the draft.",

      "The gallery ends at an oak-framed doorway leading east toward a private chamber.  To the southeast, a narrow archway leads to another, smaller chamber.  Several panes have broken in the diamond-paned windows along the southern wall, creating an icy draft."
