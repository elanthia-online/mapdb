      "Footsteps ring on the steel plate floor, the noise reverberating off of all of the metal surfaces.  Outside of the fabric swatches in front of the bottles of dye on the copper shelves, nothing soft or yielding is present in this room.  A large orb hangs brilliantly from a braided mithril and faenor cord."
