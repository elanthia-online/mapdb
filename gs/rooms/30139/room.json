      "Not much more than a raised wooden platform, a small stage lined with brass lanterns welcomes the next bardic performer.  Stools are lined up in front of a long bar crafted from polished teak, tapped barrels of ale and wine behind.  A small tip jar sits at one end of the bar next to a music box plinking out a jaunty tune."
