      "The plain white walls of the office appear almost out of place amongst the assortment of books, maps, documents, and alchemical instruments scattered about.  A large map stretches across one wall, with smaller maps of other continents pinned to the edges to expand it.  On the opposite wall a large window next to a big oak desk shines sunlight into the cluttered room.  A small tray at one edge of the desktop, the only clear space amid the tall piles of documents, holds refreshments."
