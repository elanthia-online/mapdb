      "Pale blue wool felt hangs the silvery beech frame of the spacious tent.  Occasionally they flutter as a cool breeze catches the material.  A small worktable covered with various tools sits to the back of the room.  Thick wool carpeting is scattered with large cushions that provide comfortable seating in the workroom."
