      "Rope-strung mirrors lay in graduated lengths on either side of the curving archway, casting distorted images by the faint glow of an avian-shaped iron lantern, its flame-lit eyes flickering in the ambient breeze.  A silk-woven partition partially conceals a narrow wooden door and ladder, the screen hung with a variety of household tools left in disarray.  Small wire-formed cages encircle the spiraled wrought iron staircase, the enclosures piled with dusty feathers that spill across the rug-covered floor."
