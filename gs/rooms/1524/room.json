      "In contrast to the smooth walls and estates to the north, the tall granite buildings crowding this section of South 'Haven look as though they existed long before the wooden platform that supports most of South 'Haven to the west.  Streets running to the east are barely wide enough for a single wagon, and narrow alleys separate the aged townhouses and residences fronting on the cobblestoned market plaza.",
