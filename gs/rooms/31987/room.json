      "A rusted iron gate dominates the open, dirt-packed road, its bars bent and broken beneath the wrought metal raven adorning the top, its gilt-pronged eye sockets gouged by heavy vines piercing through the available space.  The crumbling facades surrounding the gate cast ominous shadows through the broken windows, each one marked by a faded blood red sigil."
