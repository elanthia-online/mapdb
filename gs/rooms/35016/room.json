      "Retreating from the bluffs, the trail widens into a well-trodden road that rises and falls over a series of coastal hills.  Rich, fertile soil has given rise to an abundance of dusty red tundra grasses that ripple and wave in the freezing gale.  Trees dot the landscape, but none are of significant height, for their trunks are stunted by the constant battering of the elements."
