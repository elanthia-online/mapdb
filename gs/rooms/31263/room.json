      "The repulsive odor here almost distracts from the excruciating cries that echo through the corridor.  The recently painted stone walls are already peeling and cracking from the damp air.  A filthy tray rests just outside a tiny wooden door at the bottom of the wall.  There is a metal barred door leading to an inmate's cell and a solid steel door that yields no clues to what lies beyond."
