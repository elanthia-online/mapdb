      "Tall grasses to the east give way to a congested tree line to the west, the path narrowing as it yields to the dense vegetation.  Uneven patches of the jungle floor have been cleared away to make room for small shops and travel between, a splintered haft of an axe or hatchet all that remains of the endeavor.  The blinking of fireflies reveals other nocturnal visitors in the canopy above, who quickly scamper away upon being sighted."
