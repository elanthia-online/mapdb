      "Radiating from around the copper housing of the foremast, rays of birch are inlaid into the teak decking to create the image of a sun within a dark sky, the design shadowed by the dusting of snow across the ground.  Nearby, a shelter acts as a companionway to the floor below and is covered with weather-treated oilcloth to keep ice from slicking the stairs.  The muffled sound of rattling ropes and pulleys draws attention to the lashed and furled sails, the sky blue fabric dangling thin icicles from above."
