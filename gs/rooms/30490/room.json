      "Jagged rocks form the opening to the west, which leads through rushing, white-capped waters towards the open waterway, while to the east the cavern widens into a circular cove with a ceiling of glittering limestone.  A wide rough wooden dock, ringed by boats, offers a safe anchor for visiting vessels."
