      "Light from a few scattered candles reflects from the gaily striped rainbow-colored walls of the tent, illuminating the bare interior with a faint multihued glow.  Bits of charred wood and fabric and what looks like a few fragments of bone are imbedded in the freshly packed dirt floor, and a vague scent of something burnt hangs in the air like a memory.",
