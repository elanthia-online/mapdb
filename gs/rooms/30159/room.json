      "Enveloping darkness floods the senses with only the faintest trace of visible light streaking from the narrow slits of the grated trapdoor high overhead.  Long forgotten bones dangle precariously from heavily corroded manacles that litter the mossy granite surroundings.  Breaching from a deep fissure in the northern wall, a torrential stream rushes into the cavernous chamber before branching off in a series of pitch-dark apertures."
