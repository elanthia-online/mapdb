      "Fog lies heavy on the ground and obscures the southern path into the town below.  A few scraggly hawthorn trees cling to the rocky hillside and cast spindly shadows on the narrow track that winds uphill to the northeast.  High above, at the crown of the hill, the bulk of a round stone tower cuts a wide shadow across the starry night sky.",
      "Fog lies heavy on the ground and obscures the southern path into the town below.  A few scraggly hawthorn trees cling to the rocky hillside and shade the narrow track that winds uphill to the northeast with their nearly bare branches.  High above, at the crown of the hill, the bulk of a round stone tower glitters in the sunlight."
