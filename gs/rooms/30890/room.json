      "Lush, ametrine-hued velvet banners fringed in gold line the polished marble walls of the entrance hall.  The arched ceiling has been inlaid with a bevy of multicolored crystal shards, sparkling against the dark stone like stars in the night sky.  Inset with a burnished plaque, a thick, black granite pillar rises between a pair of mottled, giant glowing toadstools."
