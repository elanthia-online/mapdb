      "A flock of seagulls whirls high above a wooden mast overhead, one occasionally diving towards the water below.  A constant breeze ripples both the sea and the fabric of a winter white flyrsilk sail, the riggings moving rhythmically back and forth above some cannons on either side of the deck.  An overturned bucket serving as a makeshift stool sits in front of a fishing pole abandoned against an obsidian mistwood gangplank."
