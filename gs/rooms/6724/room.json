      "No one seems to be home in this decrepit hovel, and you wonder what sort of creature could actually live in this filth.  A fire pit dug in the center of the tent holds some gnawed on bones covered with ashes.  The stench inside here is revolting, turning your stomach as you gasp for a breath of fresh clean air."
