      "A flock of seagulls has taken up residence in the jetty's ten foot tall bulwark of tumbled stone to the east.  They perch quietly, beaks tucked securely into their breast and wing as they rest in the cooler night air as it drifts in from the ocean.  Seaweed strands cling to the limestone, their desiccated tendrils looking like extended fingers attempting to bring the jetty down into the murky depths of the water."
