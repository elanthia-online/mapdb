      "Turtle grass sprawls in loose mats across the floor, weaving through the broken remnants of a collapsed shale wall.  Jagged slabs lean against one another in precarious angles, their surfaces slick with moisture and streaked with pale veins of mica.  Sunlight streams through high gaps in the cavern ceiling, scattering fractured beams across the ruin.  A polished nacre mirror perches atop a tilted shard of stone, while a barnacle-encrusted shell-shaped sign lies nestled amid the grass nearby."
