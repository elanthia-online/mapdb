      "Fragrant, spicy smoke is visible in a thick cloud that hangs heavily in the air, originating from a thick, half-smoked cigar resting upon a jewel-studded tray on an enormous brass-accented desk.  A well-worn trollskin mantle hangs from a wrought iron stand in the corner beside a mithril claidhmore and rolaren axe.  On the opposite wall, a solid blue marble sideboard features an assortment of potations favored by the Guildmaster."
