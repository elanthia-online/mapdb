      "A single copper urn remains upright on the floor, while its counterparts have been smashed as a segment of the wall fell into the hall.  Faded chips of paint offer a mere glimpse of the vivid images they once formed on the stones.  A humanoid skull sits in the shadow of a massive pillar that is missing its top half."
