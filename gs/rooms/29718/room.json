      "Aisles created by river reed baskets form clearly defined paths upon the overlapping grass green rugs to the north and south, while tall bookcases are angled towards the easterly and westerly sections of the pavilion.  Standing alone in the center of the space, a long oak table covered with a red cloth houses a pillar-like lantern that sheds illumination throughout.  From somewhere to the south, a light breeze tugs on the various scrolls that are for sale."
