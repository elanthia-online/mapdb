      "Slumped over amid passionflowers, heliconia, and other tropical flora, a bowed ancient canver tree has crushed another of its kind beneath its significant girth.  Insects buzz and flit through the enormous, tangled mass that is the tree's branches, entrenched in a sea of pink and white blossoms.  The splintered husk of the crushed tree lies half-buried alongside the depressed mud of the trail, now home to a family of noisily chirping crickets."
