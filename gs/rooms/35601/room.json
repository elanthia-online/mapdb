    "description": [
      "A black wooden hatch reinforced with dark steel opens into an aged but orderly chamber.  Varnished planks gleam beneath the steady glow of ship's lanterns, their tarnished brass polished free of corrosion.  A mahogany desk stands against one bulkhead, unfurled charts secured by the weight of a sextant that looks newer than most of the cabin's other accoutrements.  Faded velvet drapes frame a porthole over a spacious bunk, admitting pale sunlight that illuminates gleaming motes in the air."
