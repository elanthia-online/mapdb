      "Dimly lit, this room has a dank, musty smell to it.  In the dim light provided by the sole lamp one can make out row after row of small cages.  Peering inside the cage closest to the door reveals that the occupants are bushy tailed squirrels.  Further back in the room is a small desk with little scraps of paper and a sign on it."
