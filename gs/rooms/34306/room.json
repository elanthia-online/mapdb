      "A sharp southeast curve makes a lofty descent to a wide stream that spills over stair-like rapids.  Felled timber bound together with long strands of braided, reinforced twine bind the logs together in long planks that stretch from one bank to the other, forming a makeshift bridge.  The top of the wooden structure appears unfazed by the climate, but early stages of decomposition to its underside have begun.  A silvery blue glow backlit by clouded moonlight shimmers along the water's edge."
