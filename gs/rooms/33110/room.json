      "A row of carefully stacked wooden crates lines one wall, and opposite is a metal basin on a large pine stand.  Nailed to the wall above the basin is a small piece of mirror, while a frayed linen cloth hangs from a nearby hook.  Covering the pine flooring is a worn, blue wool rug, and a large, crimson lobster claw is nailed next to a door."
