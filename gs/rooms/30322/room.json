      "Thin curls of wood, piles of sawdust, and various bundles of bright wire rest within the weatherproof jars beneath of small oilcloth-covered awnings and worktables.  Vibrant spheres of colorful glass hang from ropes in overlapping patterns by each station, adding color to the otherwise brown, green, and grey landscape.  Situated amid the workstations is a domed sinew and hide tent decorated with bright ceramic tiles."
