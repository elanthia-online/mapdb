      "A huge pile of fallen rocks, left by some long-ago landslide, blocks the entire width of the ravine to the east.  Scraggly bushes grow in the patches of soil that have built up in the sharp nooks and crannies, and the half-dried corpse of what looks like it was once a large dog lies shattered and impaled where it fell.",
