      "The mizzenmast towers over a wooden capstan, its large wooden drum wound with thick hemp rope and ready to be turned.  Some paces behind a shadowy black zebrawood wheel, the pathway leading to a wooden door is impeded by a jumble of fishing nets and an overturned launch boat.  A pair of fishing poles lean against a thick teak post on which hangs the recently polished ships bell."
