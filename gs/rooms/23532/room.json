      "Ivory crown molding joins cream-hued walls and the soaring vaulted ceiling.   An arched oak door stands to the side of a black marble fireplace, which is nestled into the western wall and has an ivy-etched mirror centered above it.  Facing the hearth is a plush floral-patterned couch framed by a set of petite lor end tables.  The northern wall boasts a series of floor-to-ceiling windows that look out onto the moonlit garden, broken only by a pair of multi-paned glass doors.  Along the eastern wall is a polished lor arch leading into the dining area."
