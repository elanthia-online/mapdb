      "A deep sinkhole yawns near the southern edge of the disc, its edges ragged and uneven as if clawed away by the fury of the rushing sea.  Standing over it is a ghastly statue depicting a hideous deviation of the humanoid form, with tentacles sprouting where its arms ought to be, its sinister, squinting eyes staring out over the restrained and vengeful sea.  The air is charged with power, an odd tingle barely audible as a crackling hum."
