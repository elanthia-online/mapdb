      "This long gathering hall is lined with rough wooden benches and a few posting boards with odd scraps of parchment tacked on them.  A few anxious-looking young men hover about the edges of the room, their nervous pacing a sharp contrast to the resigned attitude of some older folks resting on the benches.  At the far end of the hall, a sturdy maoral table serves as a desk, its contents meticulously arranged.",
