      "[A Neatly Dug Rectangular Grave]"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Apparently, this is a relatively deep hole, six feet deep and seven feet long by reckoning, seemingly rectangular in shape rather like...a grave.  It's a grave.  The size and dimensions, hard pack of the dirt, the precise cut of the walls, vertical and slightly intimidating from this angle, give it away.  Yep.  This is a grave."
