    "description": [
      "The cobblestone path leads through a pair of tall iron gates, and on the other side, the jungle seems to be successfully held at bay.  The overhead canopy of vines and verdant tree branches here is low, brushing the tops of the gate and its flanking stone wall.  Dark purple blossoms dangle just out of reach, and several thick clumps of ferns drape leafy fronds along the path.  All vegetation stays well away from an arrow-shaped sign pointing at the gates, except for a tiny, out of place, cobra lily sitting in a miniscule boggy spot."
