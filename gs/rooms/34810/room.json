      "Racks along the rough stone walls hold great barrels of wine, ale, and mead, leaving space in the center of spacious cellar for sacks of barley, hanging carcasses that have been salted to preserve them, and stacked wheels of stoutfoot blue cheese.  Despite the efforts of a lone torch ensconced on the northern wall, the cellar is bitterly cold.  Frost glints from the walls and ceiling.  A short ladder allows egress through a riveted pine trapdoor above."
