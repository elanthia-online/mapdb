      "Small pillars of matte alabaster support a domed ceiling of thick glass that casts thin rays of light over each surface.  A crucible of porcelain sits in one corner, its inside pitted and stained with use.  A small workbench of similarly hued stone dominates the center of the workroom, its worn surface faintly etched in a pattern of graceful lilies."
