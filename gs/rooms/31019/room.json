      "Stark white and austere, the service building is chiseled into the very bedrock of Ornath's south-facing cliff.  Thousands of niches stretch from a gold-veined marble floor to the curved ceiling and are filled with pillar candles in shades of white, black, red, blue, and green.  With every candle lit, the entire area is filled with a warm golden glow that illuminates a copper and teak front counter behind which an albino half-krolvin clerk works."
