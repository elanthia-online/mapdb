      "This windowless office is cloaked in shadow except for a bright candle on a chest-high desk in the center of the room.  Illuminated by the golden flame, a nearby stand lays bare the interior of a thick tome.  Barely discernible cabinets stand around the desk, their presence hinted at by the flicker of the candle's flame.  A shadow of the desk wavers on the carpeted floor from the dancing candlelight.  Almost invisible in the darkness, a set of stairs offers a way down."
