      "Swathes of fabric are strewn across the room, creating a dizzying meld of colors and patterns.  Tightly wound bolts line the wall behind a worktable and a worn leather armchair.  Short, silk-covered settees are pressed against the chiffon tapestry-covered walls of this workspace, while mannequins representing the sizes of various races are dressed in half-stitched garments on the other side.  There is a square opening in the floor with a honey-colored teak ladder set against it."
