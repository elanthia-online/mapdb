      "Stretching from one end of the space to the other, exposed rafters support the peaked ceiling and are strung with dried herbs and flowers.  A carved wooden bed rests against the flat northern wall where a decorative carving hangs over its headboard and a large wooden footlocker rests against its footboard.  Spindled balusters support a small railing that overlooks the room below, a nearby ladder providing egress."
