      "Thuja and cypress trees loom in quiet rhythm, their interwoven boughs creating a screen before a tile-lined patio where food vendors work over glowing embers.  Frosted glass lanterns cluster beneath the arches, their softened light pooling against the marble floor.  Resting within the colonnade is a white pine kiosk, its pale surface standing out against the deep hues of woven blankets, cloaks, and shawls draped in brilliant layers."
