      "Brightening the crammed shop with a rainbow of vivid hues, varied fabric bolts occupy every surface, heaped in precarious, pyramidal piles.  Dip-dyed sindon curtains stretch from one plaster wall to another, the peeling facades cluttered with leather straps and striped galabias.  Smoke coils from the smoldering chips inside a chalice-shaped brass incense burner nestled in the chaos on the counter, suffusing the air with the musky fragrance of agarwood.",
      "The small shop is crammed with cloth of every type and description.  Vividly colored bolts sit on every surface, and straps and fragments of leather clutter the walls.  The whiskery old elf who is proprietor of the mayhem sidles toward you, smiling craftily.  He is wearing a striped galabia, the long, loose robe seen in abundance on the cobbled thoroughfares outside.  Heavy incense scents the air, coiling up from a lit stick stuck into a brazier on the counter."
