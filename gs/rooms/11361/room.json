      "A couch and three chairs, sparingly upholstered, look uncomfortable, even when you imagine them new.  Perhaps comfort was never their intent.  The tapestries covering the walls, however, are another matter.  You sense they were once plush and richly woven, but many unkind years have exacted a heavy toll on them and they are now too faded and moth-eaten to even discern what they once depicted."
