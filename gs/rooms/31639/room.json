      "Faded sketches of charcoal-drawn avians cover the peeling walls, the strips of emerald exposing a bare framework of stone and wood stained in ichor.  A faint haze of ghostly white smoke trickles from beneath a narrow door, intermingling with the scent of roasting meat wafting on the other side of the hall through a doublewide archway.  Curtains of black devore velvet frame either side of a lasimor-framed doorway, the fabric restrained by circular wreaths of dried florals, the withered petals scattered across the floor."
