      "Oak-framed chairs of burnt sepia velvet are arranged before the silver-washed railing, the leaf-carved legs resting against the marbled ivory floor.  Heavy curtains are draped across the ceiling-high windows, obscuring the light through layers of sage-on-hunter green brocade, the fabric pooling below a lacquered mahogany table affixed in the far corner.  A spherical brass lantern emanates a soft glow across the table's surface, providing a faint modicum of light."
