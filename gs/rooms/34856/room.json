      "Rugged in its construction, the small stone room is scattered with various urns and crates, each a tangle of scrap metal, wires, and gears.  An overturned wooden barrel stands before a narrow slab of slate balanced between two splintered crates.  Exposed beams support a single lantern that illuminates the area in a pale glow.  Partially hidden in the shadows is a small archway covered with a tattered blanket."
