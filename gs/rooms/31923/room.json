    "description": [
      "The narrow hallway is paneled in dark wood, and the ceiling and upper walls are painted a rich, dark green, so dark as to be almost black.  Long thick carpets, red and blue and cream co-mingled, run along the wooden floors.  From above, a single stained glass shade casts a warm and colorful light.  A staircase leads up to a higher floor, and a doorway and an archway branch off of the entryway, leading deeper into the cottage."
