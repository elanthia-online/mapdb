      "[Dragonspine, Snowy Trail]"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Chiseled into the mountainside by the extreme weather conditions, the narrow, snow-covered trail follows the natural contour of an intensely steep ridge.  Massive outcroppings far above cast crippling shadows along the path and blot out any evident tracks, making the journey quite precarious.  Higher up the trail, a few towering trees bend to and fro, nearly concealing the jagged mouth of a narrow crevice boring down toward a plateau below."
