      "From high atop the main mast, a platform enclosed by a wooden railing serves as a lookout point.  Rope ladders attached to either side of the landing wind their way through billowy sails to the main deck below.  A brass spyglass dangles from a length of leather cord attached to the mast for safe keeping."
