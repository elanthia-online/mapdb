      "The dock terminates in a series of crates supporting scaffolding and stocks, the wood marred with deep gouges and permanent bloodstains.  An incongruously bright banner reads, \"Welcome!  Bring silver and shop to your heart's content!\"  Fine print has been stitched beneath the welcome stating, \"Goods, services, and attitude subject to change.\"  There is room for a handful of vessels at various docking berths on either side of the ominous stockade system."
