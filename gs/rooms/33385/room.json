      "Protecting the inner courtyards of the baron's castle, the wall is crafted of sandstone and slate blocks.  Below the crenellations, a paved yard stretches to an outer wall, while to the inside lies a well-manicured garden subdivided by a snowblossom-bordered walkway.  A narrow set of stairs descends from the top of the wall to the garden, where a small door provides entry to the castle."
