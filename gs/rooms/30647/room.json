      "Extending up through the open-air dome, a towering oak tree stands as a focal point in the courtyard, borders of foxglove and hydrangea delineating a path that encircles the keyhole-shaped indoor garden.  Fragrant orange and lemon trees flank the buildings that dot the area.  A two-story edifice looms over one end of the neatly trimmed lawn, and at its base a long pool shimmers in the sunlight.  A silver-gilt gate leads out, a weathered hut just off to one side."
