      "Widening slightly, the eastern section of the staircase has a small alcove filled with a stone bench and a large dragon egg sculpture nestled within creeping vines.  Steam from the surrounding travertine terraces cools in the night air, shimmering in the starlight as it dampens the surrounding stones.  Stone steps continue the ascent, their surface carved with scales while opposite, stairs descend towards a small harbor."
