      "Polished copper lanterns hang from several beams, their light shedding a pale warmth over the straw-covered wooden floor.  Several rows of stalls line the walls of the stable, each entry beautifully carved with a blooming flower.  Cleaned and polished tack hangs from pegs set into the walls, a stand of saddles placed underneath."
