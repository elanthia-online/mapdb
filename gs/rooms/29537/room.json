      "The western quadrant of the hall's upper gallery is dominated by a pair of Ossian pine doors with a quintet of silver stars above them.  Curving to follow the walkway, a blue wool runner with silver edges proceeds before the chamber.  Nooks along the walls hold snowflakes of azure glass, each resplendent and unique."
