      "Stretching across the center of the tent and bound to support poles in the ceiling, wooden racks of heavy garments occupy most of the traversable space.  Frosted globes in bright white provide an almost daylight-like illumination within the dark walls, while small braziers fashioned of tiny bowls set within piles of glittering sand provide a comfortable warmth.  A small wooden sign rests next to a small wicker basket near the exit."
