      "Some glass-paned double doors along the side of the manse open out of a cozy sunroom lined with tall glass windows.  Neat rows of fruit trees frame a path leading away from the doors through a small orchard, mostly consisting of wintercrisp apples, but with a few hardy varieties of plum and cherry mixed in.  The air is crisp and clean and the walls of the estate muffle most of the noise from the abounding town."
