      "Lacquered paneled walls encapsulate the room where heavy brocade curtains hang to the sides of several bay windows, which look out towards the western gate of town.  Curls of smoke drift lazily near some green felt-topped tables, where several visiting patrons are raucously engaged in games of dice and tiles."
