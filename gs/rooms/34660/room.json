      "The rows of tombstones become less even as the ground grows more hilly.  A pauper's gravestone, devoid of ornamentation, is spiderwebbed through with cracks, but most of the memorials are well-tended.  Several have bouquets of mournblooms and other flowers left before them.  No offerings sit before a small black monument near the furthest verges of the lichyard, but it is heavily ornamented with the forms of entangled serpents."
