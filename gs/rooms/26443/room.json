      "The dark rose stain on the glass windows complements the hue of the ebonwood frames while also muting what natural light filters in.  A series of darkened silver sconces hold flickering candles throughout the room, casting dancing shadows across the merchandise racks and a series of brass hooks.  Dark rose carpet embroidered with swirls of cream and ebony silk spreads across the hardwood floors, terminating at a large hallway."
