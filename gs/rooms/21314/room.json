      "Imprints of decorative seashells are scattered across the textured surface of sandcast walls, like shells dotting the sand of a beach.  A nicely worked red spidersilk rug covers the floor, which is tiled with rare ivory and scattered with a collection of large, colorful pillows for lounging.  A stained-glass window occupies the far wall, and opposite is a painted mural flanked by scented candles in sconces."
