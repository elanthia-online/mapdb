      "Far from the road, farms cling to the rolling land to the south, thinning in number as hillocks grow into proper hills.  A few have tended fields, but just as many are overgrown, the wilds racing to reclaim land that cultivation stole.  The closest field is choked by wild crallisberries, their fruits white as bone amid the verdant greenery."
