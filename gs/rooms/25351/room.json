      "Meticulously manicured grass and narrow rows of wildflowers line the edges of this path between the front gate and the manor.  Relatively open, this vantage point provides a clear view of the ground's enormity.  Anxious visitors scuttle up and down the pathway, some toward the front lawn area and others toward the front gate."
