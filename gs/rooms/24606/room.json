      "Swinging to and fro, several pale silver paper luminaries hang from the ceiling of the small workroom.  A tall stiff-backed chair and worktable rest along one side of the room, while a series of curved hooks decorate the other.  A pair of large potted toadstools stand sentry to the beaded curtain leading back into the main showroom."
