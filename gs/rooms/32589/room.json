      "This large room opens up to a generous view of the bay through a trio of floor to ceiling windows.  Dominating the room is a circular raised-map carved table surrounded by high-backed velvet upholstered chairs.  Above, the beams of the vaulted oak ceiling display a large, split-color flag, while off to the western corner a roped-off staircase leads to the floors above.  Standing opposite the stair is a detailed diorama, beside which sits a stack of tea crates branded with an onyx rose."
