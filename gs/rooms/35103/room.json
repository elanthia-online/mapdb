      "The roar of frantic betting echoes loudly from the arched stone entrance of a gambling hall, accompanied by the clink of plentiful coin.  The hall's cracked facade occupies a wide stretch of the run, and an array of carriages and carts are hitched in its yard.  Here and there loiter krolvin sailors with brimming coinpurses, ready to tempt fate.  The richness of coldleaf tobacco wafts from one open window."
