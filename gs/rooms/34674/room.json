      "Wooden beams crisscross the low roof of the backstage space, which is a bit cramped but tidy.  Desks with attached mirrors sit along the walls, each vanity laden with pots of face paint and lipstick in a rainbow of colors.  Several have wigs hung from pegs along their sides, and though most are the color of natural hair, a few come in vivid greens, pinks, and purples.  An emerald green curtain separates the small room from the stage, and a painted green door leads out into the theater."
