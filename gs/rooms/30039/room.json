      "Beyond the jagged edge of the hanging gardens' ruins and far below, the snow-clad woodland spreads to the furthest vagaries of vision.  Here and there, the primordial forest is broken by dozens of sprawling settlements, but from such a distance they seem very small.  The wind is cold and cuts like glass, screaming over the crumbling edifice like a vengeful banshee."
