      "Ornamental monir pillars line the room on each side, framing a spacious carved stone table surrounded by wrought iron chairs.  Partitioned from the main meeting space, nooks of opulent ivory leather booths face an immense pane of glass that looks out on the exchange hall below.  Tall ferns and potted greenery loom over blue cushioned couches, their foliage providing a secluded place to relax.  Positioned against a statement wall of brushed muted copper is a tessellated mistwood credenza."
