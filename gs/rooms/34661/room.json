      "In a glazed pot by the rear window of the shop, a tuft of moon sedge soaks up the daylight.  Several cots, reasonably comfortable but simple in make, are arranged neatly in the room.  Healing herbs, several gemstones, and a roll of bandages sit on a folded fabric square atop a small table near the window.  The acrid scent of astringent hangs faintly in the air."
