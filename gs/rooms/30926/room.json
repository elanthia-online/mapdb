      "The den is an airy chamber, graced with wide expanses of openings created by the growing walls of the banyan tree.  Netting, so fine it is almost transparent, provides a covering to the natural windows, and small tree frogs cling to its exterior here and there like vivid green ornaments.  Against one wall, a small fire burns within a heavy pottery container, its smoke cleverly vented through a flue to the outside."
