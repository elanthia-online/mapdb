      "Gilded leaf and vine motifs engulf vivid emerald-colored walls, highlighting the tome-filled cases of lacquered lasimor framing the curved archway from floor to ceiling.  A myriad of framed portraits cover the remaining spaces, briefly illuminated by the blackened iron sconces flickering foxfire green flames before a set of elegant glass doors, the sparks scattering into the air.  An ebony velvet runner leads upward from the jet marble floor toward a set of wide stairs, the railing of metal arabesques flanked by a duo of onyx wrens."
