      "The gravel path begins to turn westward at this juncture, while to the north, the dark silhouettes of statuary and a dilapidated chapel are voids against the color of the skyline.  A gentle breath of stirring air is constant here, and beneath the whistling of it through trees is the most subtle of whispers, indecipherable but unmistakably there.",
