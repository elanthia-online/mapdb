    "description": [
      "The bluff to the east has dropped off into the river, and the thick forest is so close to the edge as to prevent movement along the bluff in that direction.  The trail winds down the side of the bluff in a narrow and treacherous manner until it reaches a large section of rubble strewn below.  Negligence could send one plummeting either into the rushing river or onto the sharp rocks.  Neither one would be pleasant.  To the northwest the trail easily follows the edge of the bluff."
