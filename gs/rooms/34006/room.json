      "Burgundy and ivory paints create an alternating striped pattern upon the smooth stucco walls of the tidy room, while thick drapes of ebon stand guard around a pair of small windows.  A long wooden stand filled with leg greaves is displayed beneath a row of lanterns, while a small lacquered table houses a variety of matching arm pieces.  Balls of yarn and spools of twine surround a rectangular slatted box filled with mittens, gloves, and gauntlets near a rocking chair that occupies one corner of the small space."
