      "Crafted with a high, domed roof, the wagon has a large interior, which is filled with various items used in alchemy.  A stack of cauldrons dominates one corner, while several crates of jars, vials and flasks fill another.  Partially hidden by a large copper rack, a narrow door is set in the back wall.  A small cloth-covered opening leads out to a tented area next to the wagon."
