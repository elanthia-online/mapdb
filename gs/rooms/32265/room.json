      "Weapons long abandoned, rusted and bent, litter the ground as far as the eye can see, which is limited by the amount of smoke and distorting waves of heat in the air.  Smaller buildings topped with horned and spiked fortifications are occupied now only by the flames that can be glimpsed through the windows and doorless entries."
