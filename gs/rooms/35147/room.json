      "Dark red banners sway overhead, the velvet fabric gleaming faintly in the light of torches lining the huge hallway.  A high, vaulted ceiling of raw black timbers lends a cavernous quality to the space, turning the whispers and footsteps of passing guild members into distant echoes.  A crimson runner travels past dark copper statues of robed krolvin holding spheres, tomes, and daggers aloft.  Stairs descend to the lower story."
