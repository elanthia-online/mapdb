      "A stand of wind-stunted trees hangs back from the cliffside trailway, stooped under the weight of glistening snow.  They are a ragged collection of pine and alder and larch, and in their shadows, tundra grasses flourish.  A thin thread of woodsmoke beckons on the wintry breeze, but it is mostly masked by the pungence of evergreen sap."
