      "Littered with thousands of unwanted wrappers, the floor of this shop is concealed beneath a swirling, colorful sea of trash that shifts with each introduction of a new customer.  Bright and bold candies are painted across the walls and ceiling, and cotton candy-like streamers dangle from each candle-filled sconce that fills the room with dancing shadows.  An oversized sofa strewn with lozenge-shaped cushions is a vessel of respite in the otherwise choppy shop."
