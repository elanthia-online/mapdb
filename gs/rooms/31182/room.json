    "description": [
      "The terrain is rough with pockets of rimy rocks, alpine clubmoss sprouting from between the cracks like verdant, clustered fingers.  Ground cedar grows in abundance on scattered patches of flat land, creating an ideal cushion for selectively placed morduska hide tents.  Tan camel furs, extra protection against the brisk air, drape over the peaked shelters.  A trail wends by the pyramidal saxifrage lining the base of a towering granite escarpment."
