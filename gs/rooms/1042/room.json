      "Something has disturbed the grasses at this point in the trail, and although the way is obvious to the west, it is totally indiscernible in the other direction.  The heavy mists do not help matters, limiting vision to twenty yards at best, and the wet grass seems to be especially tall all around.  A dark obsidian boulder perhaps ten feet high sits nearby, its surface scarred and deeply gouged by implements unknown."
