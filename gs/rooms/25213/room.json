      "The walls open up into a circular chamber, the dark grey rock dotted with deep pits and fractures.  The entrances to several different tunnels line the curving walls, each narrow passageway quite dark and featureless.  A skeleton hangs limply from a pair of manacles bolted to the ceiling, the lifeless bones liberally draped with a shroud of cobwebs."
