      "High placed narrow windows strategically line one wall of this large room, breaking up the otherwise unrelenting expanse of stone.  Cold and bare, this room's sole purpose seems to be defensive in nature.",
      "Various vellum cut-outs are placed across the narrow windows of this large room, casting kitten and dragon-shaped shadows across the wax-splattered floor.  Dust bunnies tumble across the ground, the original intent of the room lost to a makeshift play room filled with dolls, blocks, and weaponry."
