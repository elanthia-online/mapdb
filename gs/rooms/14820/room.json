      "The trees around you are thinner here, and you find yourself standing before a large, tranquil lake.  Bright silvery moonlight dances beautifully upon the water.  Several candles can be seen floating in the distance, their pale flames barely visible.  The shrill cry of a bird suddenly pierces the silence as it flies by with a large silvery fish in its beak.",
