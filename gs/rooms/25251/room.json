      "Desultory gusts of biting desert winds have half-ripped down a metal-woven tapestry hanging limply from scaled hooks strung on a beveled iron rod.  An enormous amount of structural damage has occurred to part of an outward-facing wall, scattering sandstone debris and a fine chalky powder throughout the hallway."
