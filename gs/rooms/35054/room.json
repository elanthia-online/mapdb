      "Short steps separate the intimate chamber from the looming majesty of the adjoining hall.  A dazzling collection of moldering relics and strangely glowing magical items occupies a series of reinforced ebony cases along the far wall, neatly catalogued and evenly spaced.  Specimens marked for immediate sale occupy velvet-clad tables spaced in a semicircle.   Between the cases, an archway houses a winding basalt staircase that winds up to a small outdoor patio atop the building."
