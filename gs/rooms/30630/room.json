      "Circular in shape, simple paneling covered in a thick layer of whitewash lines the walls of the open corridor.  Set into one part of the inner hall is a varnished oak door with a crude trident etched into the lintel above.  Along another section is an iron-bound oak ladder that leads higher into the lighthouse.  Looking over a cast iron railing, one can see into the lowest chamber below."
