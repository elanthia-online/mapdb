      "Sagging shelves and collapsed cabinets fill what once served as a storeroom.  Various items litter the room, all of them seemingly rusty, rotten, shredded, mildewed, or otherwise rendered useless by the passage of time.  A thick layer of dust covers everything, and is stirred up in clouds with every move you make."
