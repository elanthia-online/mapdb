      "A series of two-story houses dots either side of the road here, though most have fallen into disrepair.  Plants have long since broken through the paths and walkways that line the unkept yards, and doors and shutters hang off their rusted hinges.  Spiderwebs cover many of the windows and porches, and a number of the roofs have notable holes."
