      "A barrel-vaulted wine cellar is dimly lit by glass-paned lanterns, the walls lined with wooden racks filled with dusty glass bottles, most of which are empty.  A cache of steel-banded hickory casks flank an aged oak press.  To one side of a curtained archway, a board of cheeses, breads, and fresh fruit have been left on a three-legged table, a trail of crumbs leading away from the fare to a small mouse hole in the corner."
