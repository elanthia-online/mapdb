      "Statues, figurines, and other sculptures fill this room, each representing one of the unaligned or lesser deities of Elanith.  Though not gaudy, the sheer variety of colorful hues in the decor lends the area a quiet exuberance which refuses to be classified as either dark or light.  The sense of presence here is not as commanding as that of the Lornon and Liabo antechambers, yet one can easily perceive an underlying, sometimes chaotic, energy in the air."
