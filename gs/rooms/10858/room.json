      "A swift breeze gently rustles the leaves of this large haon tree, partially obscuring your view of the town to the west.  The thick branches provide a natural support for the frame of the shop, while smaller branches form a railing which surrounds the porch.  Hanging off the edge of the porch is a spidersilk ladder which leads to the ground far below."
