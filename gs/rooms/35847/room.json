      "Rivulets of slowly moving, dark liquid descend along the brambled walls around a cylindrical large copper kiln, pooling within a naturally formed basin on the floor.  A blackened smoky quartz pedestal is wedged between two gnarled branches that jut upward against an angular, thorn-covered ceiling.  Wavering buffets of cold air from the west constrasts harshly with the constant, oppressive heat in this corner of the hovel."
