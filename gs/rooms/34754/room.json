      "Reliefs spread along the walls of the chamber, depicting felines lazing, hunting, and at play.  Their ancient pigments have been faded by the grinding passage of time, but the carvings themselves have been well preserved.  A mosaic depicting interlocking felines, one ebon and one crimson, spreads from the base of a low sandstone pedestal.  Atop it stands a wide brass bowl caked in dried blood."
