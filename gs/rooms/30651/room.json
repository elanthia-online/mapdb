      "Extending above the atrium, the balcony provides fresh sea air and an excellent view of the property.  Mezereon shrubs with pale lilac flowers decorate the silver railing that encloses the area.  Marble tiles veined with silver create a spiraling nautilus shell mosaic traversing the length of the terrace.  Wrought-iron chairs huddled in small groups encourage quiet conversation."
