      "Contorted spires of bubbly igneous rock jut from the sands of the beach like accusatory fingers.  The stone and sand are a study in contrasts, the former blood-dark and craggy; the latter bright as diamonds and fine of texture.  Inland, the beach makes a reluctant segue into an overgrowth of vine-draped banyans and wild sugarcane, their verdance enhanced by the stormlight in the skies overhead.  Tropical flowers in a riot of mismatched hues border a steep path delving boldly into the overgrowth."
