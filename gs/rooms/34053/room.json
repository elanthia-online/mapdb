      "As imperious as it is dazzling to look upon, a dragon of white and blue diamond tesserae adorns the zenith of an arch framing some tall golvern-framed double doors in the northern wall.  Standing to either side are lofty figures of golvern.  The twin warriors stand with their hands on downturned greatswords, the features of their faces mostly lost to the shadows near to the cavern's ceiling.  Even further overhead, a massive chandelier adorned with glistening stones casts flickering spills of light over the cavern ceiling."
