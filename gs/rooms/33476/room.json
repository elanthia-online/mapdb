      "A tattered merchant permit hangs on one of the whitewashed shiplap walls, and a rough-hewn post and beam ceiling rises overhead.  A plush white sheepskin rug sits in one corner of a wide plank pine floor.  There is an antique oak cabinet with frosted glass doors on one side of the shop and an ornate oak rack set with polished brass hooks on the other."
