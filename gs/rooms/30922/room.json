      "A glade surrounds the huge bole of a banyan tree, shielded by its leafy canopy high above as well as surrounding curtains of buttress roots.  The jungle floor is remarkably clear at the tree's base, although the curling fronds of ferns and broad-leafed sheffleras accent the clearing here and there with their verdant emerald tones."
