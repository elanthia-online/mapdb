      "Floor-to-ceiling windows decorate the western and eastern sides of the kitchen, which stretches from one end of the manse to the other to create a large eating and culinary space.  Counters and cabinets decorate the southern walls, leaving only enough room for the exit to the vestibule, while the open golden linden door offers access to the garden.  A large and round table rests at the heart of the room, surrounded by spindle-backed chairs.",
