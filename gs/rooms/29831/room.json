      "Windows line the walls of the wagon, though each is rendered useless by a heavy layer of soot in addition to the shield rack that blocks an entire row itself.  On a small counter beneath one of the windows is a steel-framed note and a dingy oil lamp, and a tattered ivory vellum sign lined with faded script is hooked carelessly over one of the rack's supports."
