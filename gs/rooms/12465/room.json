      "Families in this cul-de-sac grouped together, bringing in souvenirs from more tropical areas, planting date palms, banana trees, and coconut palms.  A sandbox nestles between two houses at the end of the street, remnants of tumbled sandcastles piled within its confines.  A few scrub pines dot the area, creating a slightly comical look to the street."
