      "The street curves sharply into a hook-like bend following the curve of the wall, which is in turn guided by the bounds of the plateau the city dominates.  Cut from the same bleak stone as the walls guarding the city, a courier's shop lurks at the end of the flourishing row of businesses.  Hanging over its door is a dyed teal jute banner depicting a set of winged boots.  Customers laden with parcels and post bustle in and out of the single-door entrance."
