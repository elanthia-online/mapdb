      "A sparkling silver sign graces the southwestern entrance to Silver Park.  Brightly colored bunting spirals down the poles in a red, green, and blue braid.  An intricate wrought iron fence abuts the festive sign, continuing around the perimeter of the fields.  A few houses dot the opposite side of the road, affording them a panoramic view of the unusual landmark."
