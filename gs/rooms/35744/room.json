      "A narrow recess in the hold is framed by a wrought iron cage that encloses double rows of still-sealed barrels bound by rusted iron hoops.  Fissures in the walls weep trickles of brine, but the skim of water on the warped deck planks is shallow and does not appear to have penetrated the aged tar sealing the containers.  Flecks of black powder cling to the lids, and the acrid tang of sulphur hangs heavy in the mildewy air."
