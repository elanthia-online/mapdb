      "A mosaic arch of pearl and agate tesserae, damaged by time and the oppressive dampness, frames the threshold of the stateroom's rear chamber.  Brass sconces hold the spent remains of the last candles that burned within them, but the glass cages that shielded the flames are but broken shards in the muck on the deck.  Damaged ebony chests gash the silted planks of the floor, their fittings corroded to crusted ruin, and the cloth they once held has been reduced to moldy tatters."
