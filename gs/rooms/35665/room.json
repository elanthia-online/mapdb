    "description": [
      "The stern of a ship bobs amid the waves, moored to its battered neighbors by haphazard stretches of line and a few stubborn pieces of wood.  Coral has begun to reclaim its other half, which is scattered across the shallow seafloor, vibrant clusters of pink and orange creeping across broken planks and the rusted remnants of metal fittings.  Fish of all shapes dart in and out of the crannies of the wreck, their scales flashing in the sunlight that pierces the clear water above."
