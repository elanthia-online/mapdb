      "Checkered tiles of white and black porcelain stretch across the floor, the contrasting pieces pristinely clean and polished to a high shine.  Scattered throughout the area are some small round tables covered in white linen cloths and flanked by matching chairs that create a cozy eating environment.  A large sign is positioned at the center of the entry, offering instructions for diners."
