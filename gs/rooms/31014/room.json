    "description": [
      "Tall ceilings rise above this spacious, rounded showroom containing a rack, a table, and shelves of leather goods for sale.  Stained glass windows stretch up the eastern wall framed by long white gauze curtains that drape all the way down to touch the floor.  Bright light from the plaza outside shines through the kaleidoscopic glass.  A curtained archway in the west wall offers a glimpse into a busy workroom beyond."
