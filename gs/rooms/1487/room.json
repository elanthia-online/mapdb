      "Piles of driftwood, obviously pieces of wrecked ships, litter the quay.  Several of the boards have names burned into them, proclaiming the ships lost to the fury of the ocean.  They do not seem to have been stacked here by humans looking to clean up the beach, but more appear to have been washed here at the will of the sea, or perhaps a greater force looking to clean up the blue waters."
