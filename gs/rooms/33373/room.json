      "Ebony-framed chairs of burnt emerald velvet are arranged before the silver-washed railing, the vine-carved legs resting against the marbled ivory floor.  Heavy curtains are draped across the ceiling-high windows, obscuring the light through layers of jade-on-burgundy brocade, the fabric pooling below a lacquered ebonwood table affixed in the far corner.  A spherical kelyn lantern emanates a soft glow across the table's surface, providing a faint modicum of light."
