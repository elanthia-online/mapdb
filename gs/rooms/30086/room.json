      "Crates and bundles sit just outside of the waterline where the rollicking tide rushes towards the land with what equates to a roar at times and a whisper at others.  The rough, irregular stones of the jetty form a backdrop to the land and a break that keeps the rougher, larger storm-tossed waves at a bay.  A scattering of discarded building supplies, and long launch poles rest upon the sand."
