      "Night and day, working-class halflings stream into the Honeybeer Inn, which stands across Bootlegger's Alley from this section of the wall.  Entering gaunt, tired, and hungry, they leave looking well-fed, rested, and restored to good spirits.  It was perhaps a feeling of envy for these patrons that led a lonely guard to carve a bees' hive and beer mug into the icy northern wall."
