      "Vibrantly colorful to the point of being lurid, the collapsed remnant of a fortuneteller's tent drape over the cobblestones of the intersection.  Sitting upright before the spill of fabric and broken furnishings and oddly untouched, a crystal ball is aglow with refracted daylight.  Several embossed fortune cards flap in the stiff breeze, painted with elaborate figures and scenes."
