      "Wrought iron lampposts are spaced to either side of the roadway, but they are unlit and the glass of their lamps is badly stained with soot.  The lane winds beneath the facades of baleful buildings the color of smoke, crowded by passersby and a somber mix of coaches, wagons, and carriages drawn by black horses and other grim beasts of burden.  A faint hint of perfume and tobacco smoke threads through the smells of the throng."
