      "The cliff rises steeply to the south above a wide swatch of dark sand.  Seaweed has been strewn among the rocks by an exceptionally high tide, and now lies drying in the sun as gulls search it for tidbits.  A row of cabins is nestled against the cliff, interspersed with a few gnarled trees."
