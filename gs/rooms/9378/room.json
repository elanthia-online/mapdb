      "The foyer is decorated with banners from nearby cities.  A large, pine desk sits in one corner of the room.  Near the entrance, a rickety podium, covered with a thick layer of dust, stands to greet visitors.  Chairs and tables, clearly not often used, are placed at intervals along the unadorned wooden walls."
