      "Creeping along the ceiling and walls of the room, a thick labyrinth of leafy vines creates a verdant enclosure, allowing only a series of wooden hooks to peek through.  Tendrils of greenery weave in and out, blanketing the floor and surrounding a tall oak hutch.  The foliage travels around a glass-inlaid ironwood door, a small copper handle barely visible through the massive tangle."
