      "Almost swallowed by the dark, briar-filled woods, many wooden edifices fight for life against the ice-hardened snow drifts blanketing the area.  Strings of jacinthe-hued baubles glow against the dark green cedar boughs to light up the path cutting through the woods.  Off to one side of the path, a giant ice sculpture sits, carved into the likeness of a jack-o'-lantern on a manticore's body.",
