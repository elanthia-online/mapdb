      "Flanked by torches, the arched entrance of the structure opens out onto a well-tended garden dominated by sage bushes.  The torches hang in elaborate bronze sconces wrought to resemble partially unfurled scrolls.  The wall opposite the entrance features a glinting mosaic of jeweled tesserae depicting a man holding a burning brand before a kneeling throng.  Waves of intense heat distort the air around an amber-inlaid grey marble arch at the mosaic's center, making its edges shimmer and dance as if alive."
