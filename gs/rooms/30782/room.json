      "Far above the main deck, higher than the top of the yards of fabric sails, a platform encircling the main mast looks out over the ship and to the sea beyond.  A spyglass hangs from a length of knotted leather cord tied to the narrow railing.  Carved into the wooden trapdoor in the platform is a detailed kraken, a broken ship wrapped in its suckered tentacles."
