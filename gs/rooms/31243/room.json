      "Silver-threaded ivory carpets line polished birch floors, wending through the pavilion's lushly lined interior of amethyst silk and ivory velvet.  A padded crystal case rests near the end of one carpet, while a rich mahogany chest is thrown open near the center of the area, a silver-framed parchment discreetly placed to one side."
