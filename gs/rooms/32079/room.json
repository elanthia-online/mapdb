      "Deep and sluggish, the water plods along its course, the riverbed overhung with a thick canopy of leaves from the enormous trees along the banks.  A stoppered glass bottle is carried downstream by the current, narrowly missing a jumble of roots and rocks protruding from the eastern hillside.  An unmarked tombstone rests in the shadow of an ancient weeping willow."
