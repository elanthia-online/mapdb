      "Crescent-shaped, the courtyard stretches from the iron-fortified gates towards several broad steps that lead to the keep's heavy ironwood doors.  Alures offer guards viewpoints of the city beyond as well as the courtyard, while access to these places are concealed within the four towers that dot the curtain walls.  Balconies and windows also overlook the cobbled expanse, their ledges draped in pennants of emerald green emblazoned with a single ivory swan."
