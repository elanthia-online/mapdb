      "Pristinely clean, it is clear the kitchen staff takes great pride in keeping the place neat and orderly, even while at the height of preparation and cooking.  Two large ovens sit side-by-side, fueled with fragrant wood from a stockpile stacked below.  A tall fireplace is well ventilated, as not a wisp of smoke escapes out into the room, despite all the pots hanging from the rack set over the the flames and glowing coals.  Scarred but well-conditioned, an oak worktable dominates the center of the room."
