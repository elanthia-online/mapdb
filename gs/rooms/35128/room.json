      "The northern wall of the city ends in a jagged breach, and the cracked remains of the heavy basalt blocks composing it litter the lip of the chasm that has broken the city in twain.  Through the vast gap, the harsh beauty of the island beckons, snow-capped forests and rolling hills drawing the eye to the cold black shores to the north.  Heedless of nature's fury and splendor, a cedar plank shop stands in the shadow of the wall, built on the foundations of an older stone dwelling that has been lost to time."
