      "Iceblossom and resting poppy festoon the grey granite arch looming over the entrance of the sprawling village.  Homes and businesses of raw timber are writ large, their doorways wide and tall enough to handle occupants far beyond the breadth of the widest dwarf or tallest giantman.  White stones pave the winding paths among the oversized dwellings and are kept free of debris and snowfall.  The air is laden with the huskiness of incense smoke."
