      "Carved into the stoic cliffs, this hideout emerges, its structure an assemblage of shipwreck remnants.  Sun-bleached walls rise to a vaulted ceiling, lined with portholes allowing a view of the sky through the lush canopies.  In the heart of the chamber, a masterfully carved war table stands ensconced by chairs assembled from salvaged ship wood.  One wall is adorned by a forged stove, while on another, a well-worn dart board hangs, made of aged wood and ringed by scores of near-misses."
