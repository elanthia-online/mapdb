      "One slip could be the difference between a good night's sleep and a night's sleep for good.  Fortunately, the steep trail has been reinforced with chipped wood and gravel, soaking up some of the mud that causes the trail to become impassable.  While the peak of the trail appears to end in a few hundred feet, the base is still quite a distance away.  A small patch of wildflowers offers a burst of color in an otherwise gloomy area."
