      "The interior of the wagon is richly appointed, its walls of golden oak rising from a floor carpeted in thick sage-hued rugs to a ceiling of sturdy beams.  At regular intervals, gilt-based lamps are stationed around the perimeter of the area, creating a warmly lit space in which to browse wares.  A single table occupies the majority of the floor space, its legs carved to resemble a majestic wyvern, while cases marked with the crests of the elven houses edge the walkway leading further into the shop."
