      "A dusty skylight admits a faint glow of moonlight to the cramped attic passageways, and a draft from some crack in the wall sends dust-motes glimmering in the dim beams.  Boxes, crates, old paintings and rolled carpets fill the attic, and a space has been cleared for a few old pieces of furniture to serve as a sitting room."
