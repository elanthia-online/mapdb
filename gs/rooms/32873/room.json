      "The grey-hewn walls of stone are covered in flecks of precious metal and gemstones, the surface glinting with the ambient light cast by several silver-forged lanterns leading towards the manor.  Dried tufts of cave moss frame the pathway to a carved haon door, the wood decorated with a lively scene of several dwarves in a bustling market, the intaglio encircling a gilded plaque.  Nestled into the corner of the door and walls is a mine cart-shaped donation bin."
