      "Heat, sere and overpowering, washes up in shimmering waves from a chasm splitting the plateau in twain to the west.  Steep walls of slick obsidian plummet toward a narrow ribbon of lava dizzyingly far below.  Only a railing of wood stakes and braided sinew stands between a hapless traveler and a final fall.  A bridge of volcanic stone, its parapets elaborately carved with a tangle of sea serpents, spans the gap.  The sturdy bridge seems a thin and treacherous thing given the drop to either side."
