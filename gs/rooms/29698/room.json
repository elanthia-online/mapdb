      "Frames of driftwood form the body of the structure, rising high to meet the faded flags of leather and canvas that drape across decorated alcoves set within recess of the pentagonal design.  Woven rugs of hemp muffle the ambient noises of the outside, leaving only the soft crackle of lanterns casting beams of light towards the northern recess.  Faint wisps of incense caress the offerings laid bare before a grey marble statue, fading as they reach the open air.",
      "Frames of lacquered bamboo form the body of the structure, rising high to meet the lengths of pastel-dyed silks that drape across decorated alcoves set within recess of the pentagonal design.  Muted taupe rugs, crafted from soft wool, muffle the ambient noises of the outside, leaving only the soft crackle of lanterns casting beams of light towards the northern recess.  Faint wisps of incense caress the offerings laid bare before a grey marble statue, fading as they reach the open air."
