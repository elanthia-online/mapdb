      "Crossing a wide stream to connect the western and eastern side of the ridge is a felled-timber bridge that stands a few feet above the rushing water.  Faint outlines of a towering peak, higher than any other visible point in the vicinity, becomes visible when the cloud cover thins to a translucent veil and reveals the hidden beauty.  Intense golden flashes illuminate the sky behind the concealing nimbus in a captivating light show."
