      "Various ships are scattered across the bluish green waters of the Eastern Seaboard, their colorful sails of leather and sailcloth decorating the horizon.  Rope-lashed crates flank the faenor-railed bridge across the boardwalk, the containers stacked alongside the resaeun-framed booths displaying their wares.  A silk-sailed galleon topiary stands at the center of the nearby dock, the foliage surrounded by pearl-crested waves of turquoise arathiel."
