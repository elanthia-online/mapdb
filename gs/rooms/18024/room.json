      "Snapped in two and frozen solid to a fence, a street sign lies forgotten, unreadable through the many layers of opaque ice.  Sled tracks mar a sizeable hill built by the unceasing winds, the neighborhood children taking advantage of the steep slope.  Hints of gold paint flicker from the housing set back from the road."
