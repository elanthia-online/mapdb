      "The sheer absence of light makes traversing this enclosed tunnel tricky for even the most experienced hunters.  While feeling along the walls could aid in navigation, the coating of mucilaginous slime may dissuade the squeamish from relying upon that method.  Echoes from nearby chambers provide intermittant distractions from the darkness."
