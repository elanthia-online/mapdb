      "The front half of this large, festive tent has been sectioned off from corner to opposite corner, leaving a triangular display area.  A single pole stands in the center, supporting the peaked roof.  Twisted paper streamers of every imaginable color arc outward from the top of the pole to the uppermost sections of the walls.  A brightly painted table sits against the partition, and a large display stand sits along one wall."
