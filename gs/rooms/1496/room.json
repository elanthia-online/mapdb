      "Surprisingly, the courtyard wall facing the intersection with Murre Road is constructed of solid grey blocks, as is the manor that can be seen between the polished brass bars of the courtyard gate.  The tops of yew trees visible above the wall are undeniably similar to those of many other potted trees in South 'Haven, but the stone wall and manorhouse are remarkable in this platformed part of town."
