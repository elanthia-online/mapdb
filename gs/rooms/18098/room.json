      "The modwir walls of the wagon are stained with an assortment of colored inks.  Splashes of red and blue mix with greens and other hues to form a colorful mess.  Dozens of glass-paned lanterns hang from ceiling beams and hooks on the walls, providing an ample amount of light within the wagon."
