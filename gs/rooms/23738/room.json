      "Sandwiched between the mortared walls of the building's exterior and the wood-panelled uprights that give shape to the rooms within, this narrow passage is barely wide enough to squeeze through, even when pressed sideways against the grimy surfaces.  The air is stale, with a pervasive mustiness that assaults the senses.  Though some light filters in from tiny cracks in the closely pressed walls, it provides little illumination and does nothing to the eliminate the claustrophobic feel."
