      "Moonlight breaks through a single, small round window, casting a gentle beam upon an awkwardly placed splintered oak bureau containing the remnants of a large rat's nest.  Several shelves line a shroud-draped wall, most of which are broken and covered with dust.  From beyond a garland-framed arch, the sounds of creaking floorboards echo throughout the area with no hint to their source.",
