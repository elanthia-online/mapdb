      "Carved jack o'lanterns flicker with an eerie yellow-green light in a semi-circle along the circumference of the short, battered wooden interior walls of this tiny hut.  Shadows dance across the remnants of a stained wooden workbench and a gouged patchwork table in the center of the space, clearly abandoned long ago.  Indiscernible whispers echo throughout the hut, or maybe it is just a passing wind forcing its way through the gaps in its thatched roof."
