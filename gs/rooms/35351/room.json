    "description": [
      "Refurbished tobacco wood furnishings fill the air with an earthy aroma that is sweetened by the delicate citrus and sweet clover notes of the bright red and sunny yellow ranunculus that fill the porcelain vase in one corner of the room.  An enormous bed covered in a thick comforter dominates the cobalt blue-tiled floor, while an ivory porcelain wash basin rests upon a nearby bureau.  Stained glass mosaic tiles decorate the stucco walls, each depicting brightly colored abstract representations of crustaceans."
