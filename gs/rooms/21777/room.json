      "This spacious room is warmed by sunlight streaming in through a window facing east.  A large canopied bed covered by an emerald green down comforter lies against the wall directly beneath the window.  The oak floor is covered by a luxurious snow-white puma fur rug that almost looks as inviting as the bed.  In one corner stands a small bookcase filled neatly with several leather-bound books with esoteric titles.  Occasionally, you hear a faint sound coming from underneath the bed."
