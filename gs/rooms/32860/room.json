      "Two huge toadstools in large stone pots illuminate a large, comfortable room.  Dusky brown granite benches line two of the marble walls, facing each other across the sapphire carpet.  Mounted above one bench is a stuffed tusked boar head and above the other hangs a huge silver lion head with a gaping maw and savage looking fangs.  On one wall, a silver arch allows exit to the corridor outside, while on the other wall a curtain provides entrance to the locker area."
