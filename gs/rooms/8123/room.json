      "Round tables and old chairs occupy most of the floor space.  The tables all have lit candles on them, many of the candles stuck onto wine bottles.  The wooden floor is worn and uneven, more a dirty-grey than the original brown.  On the walls hang weapons, a couple of brass-studded targes and several finely carved oak crests."
