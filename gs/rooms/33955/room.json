    "description": [
      "Perhaps once a cozy home, this abode boasts only scratched wooden floors where furniture might have stood and the sort of wear in which derelict buildings are so often clad.  The scent of smoke hangs heavy, and the peeling dark green-striped ivory wallpaper is stained with a notable soot line near the ceiling and various oddly pristine spaces on the walls where paintings likely hung.  Leaving a vast emptiness before it, a tall ebonwood-framed counter with glass inserts stands near the back of the room, and atop it rests a sectional filigreed case."
