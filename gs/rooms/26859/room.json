      "Large glaes orbs fixed along the walls cast a dim green-yellow light throughout the tunnel, and add a rich tint to the otherwise pale lichen that has formed along the stone.  Neatly placed cobblestones lead to the manor's carved haon door which is set directly into the solid stone wall.  A rough-hewn donation bin has been tucked into a small crevice in the rock, and a large gilded plaque is affixed to the front of the door."
