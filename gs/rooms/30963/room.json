    "description": [
      "Gold veining creates decorative designs upon the smooth pavers that stretch across the courtyard, the tightly fitted pieces free of vegetation or debris.  Large brackets anchored to the cliff face dangle incandescent globes over the quiet streets, producing a soft illumination that dispels the dark of the island night.  Several shops dapple the northern edge of the courtyard, their wide-open doors facing a series of stone steps that lead southward towards a central fountain."
