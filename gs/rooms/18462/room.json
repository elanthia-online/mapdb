      "The cheerful interior of the wagon features bright yellow walls painted with vividly clashing violet wildflowers.  Strung from wooden beams, garlands of fresh and dried spring flowers give the wagon a sweet floral scent.  A rickety oak table has been erected in the middle of the room, with a small sign propped up against it."
