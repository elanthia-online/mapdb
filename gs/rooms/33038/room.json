    "description": [
      "Golden linden beams span the light and airy chamber, dividing the painted ceiling into twelve distinct scenes.  Draped in sapphire silk, a canopied feather bed is flanked by nightstands topped with pillar candles, while a nearby washstand houses a clear glass bowl and a neat pile of white cotton towels.  Cushioned box seating sits beneath the open mullioned window, providing both storage and a means of viewing the garden and verdant forest beyond."
