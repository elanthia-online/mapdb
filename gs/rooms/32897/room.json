    "description": [
      "Warehouses and customs buildings cluster along the western side of the curving road, their dark roofs and white stucco walls a contrast to the cobbled street.  Nestled amid the structures is a long two-story tavern that has bawdy music spilling from its doors and windows.  The southernmost edge of the street grows sparser as grasses are reintroduced into the environment along with a smattering of palm trees."
