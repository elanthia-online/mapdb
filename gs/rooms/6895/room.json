      "Several tall bolts of cloth lean in the corners, carefully tied about the middle.  The crimsons and azures have long since faded into ruin, and the dust makes them unrecoverable, but they do serve to speak of the prosperity of this smuggling operation.  A stack of hides stands next to them, looking ugly beside the elegant material."
