      "The sound of crashing waves permeates the room, with the occasional high-pitched cry of a gull.  The walls are divided a third of the way up by curved wave caps, the water painted in deep blues, greens, and purples.  The upper portion resembles the sky, with puffy white clouds and a seagull in flight.  Sunk into the ocean-blue floor so only the top sections show, a replica five-masted sailing vessel sits near a model pirate ship, its tart-over-crossbones flag unfurled.  A glass-covered mahogany pedestal rests at the edge of the room."
