      "Waterlogged oak planks have been scattered with a variety of animal pelts, their furs matted and caked in smells and substances unknown.  Rudimentary wooden chairs, bound in frayed lengths of sinew and leather, sit in a half-circle in front of a discolored fieldstone fireplace.  A stack of blackened crates serve as makeshift tables, each one covered in candles in various stages of melting."
