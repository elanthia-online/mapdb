      "A crude canopy of rough pine planks and tattered canvas stretches low overhead, providing only basic shelter to the wares housed in this open-air structure.  Jewelry dangle thick from a series of small iron hooks hanging from the planks, the long strands of glittering chains and beads strewn about in a cluttered and disorganized mess.  Behind a narrow row of cases is a crooked pine-planked door."
