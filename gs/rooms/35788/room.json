      "Wide, glassless windows wreathe the semi-circular room filling it with pale moonlight and gentle seaborne breezes that bring a chill to the night air.  Anchored to the conical ceiling, fine bug netting encircles a four-poster white birch bed draped in silky beige sheets and a down-filled chocolate brown comforter, while an ornate and carved mahogany armoire rests against the southern wall near a tall screen of linen that leads to the cottage's commons."
