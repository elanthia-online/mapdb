      "The ground is quite soft here and you notice that your footprints are quickly filling with water as you pass.  Swarms of bloodsucking flying insects, similar to mosquitoes but much larger, seem to sense that you are having trouble moving through this area.  They land on every inch of exposed flesh and the resulting pain is enough to cause you to cry out in frustration."
