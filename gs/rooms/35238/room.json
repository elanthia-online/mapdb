      "The air is thick with the pungent stink of tanning agents and the sickly sweet odor of animal carcasses.  Windows opened to let the malodorous melange escape share the stony walls with fine furs and fangs from a wide assortment of beasts.  Behind the counter a swarthy furrier works her trade, aided by tanning racks and vats of murky yellow fluid.  A massive skull with curled horns and a long jaw hangs over the partition."
