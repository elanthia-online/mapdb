      "The darkly stained white oak flooring from the living quarters continues into this study where a carved mahogany desk and velvet-backed chair dominate the center of the room.  Behind the desk, a large city map has been hung on the bright blue wall between a pair of sconces.  The walls on either side of the desk are lined with white bookcases containing books dedicated to various historical and nautical pursuits."
