      "Forming a large arch over the wide canal, blue limestone blocks are fitted with green pavers to create a wide bridge with verdigris copper railings.  To the west and slightly below, the canal waters are controlled by a series of sea gates that adjust the flow depending on the direction of the vessels trapped in its sections.  Dike revetments curve along the northern and southern banks, protecting the city in the event of stormy weather."
