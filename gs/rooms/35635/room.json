      "Curtains of vines heavy with scarlet and sunny yellow flowers cascade down from the high branches, their bright petals like a waterfall of color suspended in the air.  The humidity lends intimacy to their honeysuckle fragrance, drawing hummingbirds and butterflies that flit tirelessly among the blossoms.  Droplets of water patter down from the canopy, moistening the earth of the path.  It is soft and springy, carpeted in fallen petals in myriad hues."
