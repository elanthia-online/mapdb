    "description": [
      "White marble pillars form a perfect circle, their bases connected by a low wall that separates the space from the sea beyond.  Beneath the domed roof, thousands of blown-glass fishing orbs hang from delicate iron chains, their cobalt, emerald, and amber hues shifting in the changing light.  At the center, a marble statue of Niima rises from a sculpted tidepool of anemones, one hand extended to a child kneeling at the edge, offering a single windflower.  Beyond the open archways, the ocean stretches to the horizon."
