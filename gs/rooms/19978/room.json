      "The far wall is painted to resemble the exterior of the large temple of Wehnimer's Landing.  Darkly hued, a wrought-iron gate is depicted in the foreground.  To one side of the gate, a replicated glowing white stone rests on the grey marble floor, while on the other side a pillow-topped gold pedestal stands alone.  On another wall, two gold-framed paintings hang above a glass-topped display case, its contents glittering in the light of ensconced lanterns set along the walls."
