      "The sounds of hammers and saws echo from a shipyard nearby, as the creation and repair of war vessels carry on at all times.  Cold winds rip across the pier, carrying the salty scent of the sea and the pungent odor of fish guts.  The dark waters reflect the dreary sky, creating an almost gloomy ambiance."
