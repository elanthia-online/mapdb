    "description": [
      "The rancid stink of fish is almost oppressive, enhanced by the heat pouring off of a river stone hearth that dominates the northern wall of the hut.  Windows look out onto an anemic marketplace, but the sole door opens out onto the banks of a slow-moving and crystal clear river framed by drifts of snow.  Across from a small bed is the source of the stink: a stained table piled high with gutted fish."
