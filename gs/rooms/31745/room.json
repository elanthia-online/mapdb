      "A statuesque oak looms over the graves here, aged well beyond mortal reckoning as its trunk is so broad that six giantmen, standing arms outstretched and hand in hand, could not fully encircle it.  Its branches are low and inexplicably long, as if sagging beneath the great masses of long moss that drape from their lengths, and the gravestones sheltered beneath them are darkened by the lichen that has grown to overtake the names chiseled there."
