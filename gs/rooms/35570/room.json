      "Shallow beds of turtle grass weave through a series of low coral formations, their rough surfaces cradling clusters of massive tridacna gigas.  Sunlight spills through wide openings above, striking the giant shells where vivid algae-rich mantles bloom in waves of blue, green, and violet.  Rippling patterns shift slowly across the soft flesh, throwing colored reflections across the water.  A polished nacre mirror rests against a coral ledge, while a barnacle-encrusted shell-shaped sign nestles amid the grass nearby."
