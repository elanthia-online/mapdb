      "The stink of tanning solution and uncured hides sours the air, barely fettered by the presence of floral sachets in the windows of nearby shops.  Trappers wait in line outside the furrier's shop that is the odor's obvious source, most carrying pelts, but a few laboring beneath the weight of a whole carcass.  Hanging from the thatched roof of the shop is a bright blue banner.",
      "A rather squat-looking wooden store perches south of the road and the sound of high pitched shouting rings out from within.  Hanging from the thatched roof of the furrier's store is a bright blue banner."
