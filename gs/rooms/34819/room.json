      "Hacked and burned, the northern buttress roots of a large ceiba are cleaved close to its trunk, while southern ones have arcs carved into them provide egress into the swampier parts of Bittermere Woods.  Departing from the tumbled cobblestones of an ancient pathway that is partially claimed by the forest, a moss-covered stepping stone walkway disappears into the northern expanse.  Suspended in the dark canopy, heavy black iron cages sway as avians land upon them, causing shackles bound to skeletal feet to clang against their undersides."
