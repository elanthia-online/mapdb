      "Disturbingly, this small alcove is a complete disparity from the main part of the cottage.  Skilled trompe-l'oeil has been applied to the walls, the rendering of clouds all around creating the despairing illusion of floating.  Fanciful designs of feathers drift here and there in hues of fuchsia, cerulean, and twilight.  Atop several clouds are playful circus scenes featuring striped tents and ferris wheels, flying pennants and strung with lanterns, but they are devoid of any customers."
