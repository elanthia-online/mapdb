      "Numerous small cubbies are carved into the thick walls of the tree.  Scrolls, books, and various other archival records are neatly tucked away, each organized by a general category.  A tall teak bookshelf stands in the center of the room with a variety of artifacts displayed upon it.  A dozen padded chairs are arranged to provide comfortable reading spots.  Opposite a series of small teak desks stands a large iron door."
