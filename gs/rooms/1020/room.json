      "The mist below glows white from the moonlight.  The stars are filtered out by the bright moons, but are still visible.  The dark ledge is smoothed somewhat, and traces of moss line the small indentions of the rock.  The stiff breeze adds a chill to the air.  A rocky crevice leads upwards, and the ledge expands towards the northwest.",
      "A few small, puffy white clouds float in the air around the peaks of the mountain range above.  The deep blue sky shimmers beyond the mountains and clouds.  The stiff breeze adds a chill to the air.  A rocky crevice leads upwards, and the ledge expands towards the northwest."
