      "Flowers of every color imaginable fill the area with their pleasant, fresh scents.  Several large, glass cases protect the more fragile flowers, while hardier flowers fill vases and planters on various tables spread around the circumference of the room.  A tiered oval table takes up the center of the room and displays bouquets, floral assortments, and an order book for custom orders.  Florist Leylana flits around, tending to the blooms.  A rounded arch, recessed into the western wall, leads back to the concourse."
