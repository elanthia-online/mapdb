      "Sleeping furs are tidily piled against the back wall of the domed tent, while a firepit at the center is surrounded by various cooking stones and baskets of food.  Whittling tools are carefully arranged upon racks lashed to the walls of the tent, their polished ends gleaming in the ambient light of both the nearby fire and the frosted globes that are attached to the support posts of the ceiling.  Near the exit, a low round table is stacked with wares."
