      "Lining the road like a king presiding over his land, the fence separating the road from the western lands is well-kept.  A sheen of bright white paint covers the posts and rails, and the construction seems to be fairly new.  Even the grass beneath it is trimmed back.  The rhubarb on the other side of the road, however, is teeming with wild growth."
