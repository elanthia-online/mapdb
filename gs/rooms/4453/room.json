      "A pair of stout wooden cases fronted by glass doors take up one corner of the chamber, while a smaller more delicate curio atop a pedestal sits in another.  The locks on all the cases look quite intricate.  The insignia of the Grenroa Clan, a pair of crossed golden shovels, adorns one wall."
