      "Velvet-padded wooden stools are spaced near to the railing of the small balcony, meant to provide rest for the musicians who entertain the abbey's guests.   The traceries of the parapet are ornate and intricate.  Several music stands are stowed to one corner, discreetly out of view of the grand hall below.",
      "Wooden stools that once provided rest for the musicians who entertained the abbey's guests now lie broken and splintered upon the floor.  The traceries of the parapet are less ornate and intricate than those of the buttery screen below, indicating that this room was perhaps a later addition."
