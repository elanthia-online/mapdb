      "Undermined by the relentless prying of snowmelt, a face of the adjacent mountain has sheared away, collapsing into rubble that blocks much of the ancient white roadway.  Revealed by the rockslide, a vast stone figure strains from the wounded mountainside, one cracked hand outstretched as if reaching skyward.  Much of the colossal form is still trapped within the unyielding rock of the mountain."
