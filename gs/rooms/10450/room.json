      "Sunshine from above warms the grassy sward of this area as the ground slopes up to a hillock to the east.  An old oak planked wagon can be seen here, modified into a makeshift shop for one of the local merchants.  Piles of boxes and other goods have been stacked up along one side of the wagon, allowing for easy access to the merchant's goods.",
      "Gentle moonlight illuminates the area, making the moderate slope of the hillock to the east quite noticeable.  An old oak planked wagon can be seen here, modified into a makeshift shop for one of the local merchants.  Piles of boxes and other goods have been stacked up along one side of the wagon, allowing for easy access to the merchant's goods."
