    "description": [
      "The outskirts of a small hamlet are sheltered by a curving palisade of pine stakes.  A narrow gap in the wall serves as the only means of egress from the settlement.  Dwellings of raw timber, with windows of glass or oilcloth, huddle around a hard-packed dirt road leading deeper into the heart of the small village.  Near one home, furs hang on a laundry line, flapping on the sharp-edged breeze.  Smells of woodsmoke and fresh fish flavor the crisp, frigid air."
