    "description": [
      "Austere and cramped, the storeroom is lined on two sides with wooden shelving holding stock to be sold.  Through the middle of the room, a simple cotton rug provides some covering for the rough hewn wood floor as a silver-latticed lantern overhead provides lighting.  Against the back wall, a set of stairs leads up to a carved oak doorway, while a gilded ironwood chest rests upon a small platform in the open space beneath them."
