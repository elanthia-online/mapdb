      "The cavernous hallway continues to the east and west, its tall stone walls interrupted on its southern expanse by the lintels of an immense ora door.  Across from the door is an alcove, the entrance surrounded with a dense halo of carved sigils.  Ora braziers are set into the rock to either side of the alcove."
