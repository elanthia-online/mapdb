      "Austere in its appointments, the only major decoration to the tent is a large, black wool carpet edged in gold silk fringe which covers the ground.  Shelves, chests, and cases are places about the room to best present their contents.  Numerous square, crystal-paned candle lanterns suspended from sturdy fel support poles provide a warm light as the heady scent of burning incense wafts though the air."
