      "The overwhelming stench of blood blankets the tunnel, worsened by the heat belching from geothermic vents furrowing the walls.  Ringed by tumorous slime molds attracted by the subterranean moisture, the gashes look like wet, uneven mouths.  Several niches large enough to hold several humanoids have been etched out of the rock to either side of the winding path, half barred by walls of hardened resin.  One open chamber's floor is tacky with half-clotted gore."
