      "A small courtyard has been partitioned off by a mostly intact wrought iron fence that stretches along the path to the northeast and as far eastward as the eye can see before it disappears into darkness.  Behind the vine and rust-encrusted bars of the fence is a collection of uniform grave stones, all in neat rows and all of approximate size and shape.  At the center of the arrangement is a statue encircled by a round bench that traverses the circumference of its base."
