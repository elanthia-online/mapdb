      "A cacophony of caws and squawks fills the rookery tower, resounding off of the low eaves of the roof.  Hundreds of ravens dwell in the space.  The scent of their droppings commingles unpleasantly with the sweetness of a layer of straw on the floor, which is also scattered with shiny black feathers.  Windows in each of the four walls provide a high vantage of the stately village below."
