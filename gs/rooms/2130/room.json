      "A quiet cul-de-sac in this land of flames and ash, this area is bracketed by the volcano's cone on the west, the lava fountains flaring along the ridge to the south, and the streams of lava flowing from them to the east.  Even in this area of relative peace the blanket of ash makes footing unsure."
