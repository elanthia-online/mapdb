      "This cave is hot and humid, the air heavy with the smell of fungus.  Crowds of glowing pale blue trumpet mushrooms release luminous motes that tumble through the darkness over tall golden parasols and creamy flathead toadstools that compete for space in the nutrient rich deep brown humus below your feet.  Heavy droplets fall from green moss tendrils that hang overhead."
