      "Bayside Road widens here, as throngs of people head southward into the North Market.  More than a few are drawn by the mouthwatering aroma of fresh-baked goods wafting from the doorway of the half-timber building opposite the bridge.  To the northwest, the Market Bridge spans the bay, heading towards Marshtown."
