      "Leaping flames of bronze, copper, and gold climb the steel supports of a foreboding prayer gate before the entrance of a glinting fane.  The ornate facade of the structure is wrought from intricately etched metal the color of the sky on a moonless night.  In marble planters along the high outer wall, purple nightshade flourishes alongside a riot of crawling green jasmine vines that are heavy with fragrant blossoms.  Along the wall, torches burn in smoked steel brackets despite the hour."
