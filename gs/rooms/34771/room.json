      "Luminous garnets studding the face of the northern wall limn the uneven stones of the walkway a dark carmine hue.  They cluster most tightly about the bulk of an oily black alcove enameled with crisscrossing webs, casting their inner fire over the pages of a slender black tome atop a silver pedestal.  Tattered cobwebs drip down from the ceiling in glittering curtains, forming jagged patterns at the corners of of the shrine."
