      "Awash with the soft glow of several lanterns, the pier's end is spacious and open.  In the center, a wooden table holds navigation charts secured by small stones to prevent them from blowing away in the gentle seaborn breeze.  A faint haze of mist darkens the horizon, turning the aquamarine waters indigo further away from the encompassing light."
