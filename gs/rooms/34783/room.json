      "While the area directly around the road itself is cleared, large areas of the foliage become progressively dense the further away from the path one would dare to travel.  The tree branches spreading overheard appear to link seamlessly together, blocking any hint of light from above.  The effect makes the immediate area a patchwork of soft light and deep shadow, while in the distance, the shapes of what appear to be large rectangular boulders lie at the edge of your vision."
