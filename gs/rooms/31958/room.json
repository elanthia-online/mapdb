      "Gnarled, fruitless orchards stretch behind the moldering frames of ruinous houses, shrouded by smoke curling from the orange embers tucked within the wreckage.  A blackened cottage, a stalwart survivor observing the still smoldering scene, stands defiantly beside a ramshackle stand with a slashed canvas canopy.  Facedown in the churned mud between widely spaced cobblestones, a wooden doll in tattered clothing lies abandoned before a gouge-riddled storefront."
