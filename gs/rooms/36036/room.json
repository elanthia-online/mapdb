      "Warm lamplight spills across tightly packed shelves of small-size armor, each piece crafted from supple goat hide, brushed wool, or polished leather.  The curved walls of the ger are lined with felt panels stitched in spiraling horn motifs, and a faint scent of juniper smoke lingers in the air.  Tools hang neatly beside a low workbench."
