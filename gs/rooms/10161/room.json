      "A sudden rise in the landscape and the trail stair-steps up among a small crown of boulders.  From this vantage point, the sun glimmers off the surface of the lake, its size difficult to judge from this distance, yet docks on opposing shores are evident.  Below, the ground slopes down to a steep ravine cut long ago from the ravages of a river.",
