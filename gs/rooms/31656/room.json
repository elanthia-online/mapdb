      "Formed by an ancient landslide, the river waters flow into a substantial pool before tumbling down over a natural dam in a crooked line of rocks.  High on an illuminated ridge, an extensive orchard filled with apple and nut trees glows like a smoldering ember against the darkened hills.  A small fleet of boats are left unattended near the shore."
