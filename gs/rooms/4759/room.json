      "Nearly consumed by creeping tendrils, wide-leafed ferns and prickly briars, the barely visible path winds its way through a forest of black oaks and the occasional yellow birch.  Hanging from a stout branch, a wooden placard about the size of a human face moves gently in the slight breeze.  The woven cord which suspends the placard is badly frayed, but appears strong enough to maintain its weight.",
