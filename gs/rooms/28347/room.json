      "Torchlight, faint but warm and inviting, spills into the dusty chamber from the ruinous remains of a stone barricade.  Splintered stones, sediment, and dried-out dirt are scattered about the uneven ground that gently slopes upward as it spreads to the southeast.  Chalk, charcoal, and paint lend their pigments to the smooth walls at opposite ends of a ravaged aperture."
