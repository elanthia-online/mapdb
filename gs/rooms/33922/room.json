      "This small but cozy room is neat and tidy.  Dual candelabras spill warm, golden light across a modest desk facing an arched ironwood door in the north wall.  A pair of padded chairs faces the desk, all resting on a geometric-patterned, rust and gold carpet.  A low cabinet runs the length of the west wall across from a stone bust standing on the eastern side.  Behind the desk, barrels of rolled up papers flank a large bookcase."
