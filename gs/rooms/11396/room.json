      "Perched from the top of a battlement is a single flagpole bereft of flag or banner.  Painted up and down its length are spirals of rust, which coalesces at the base of the pole, staining the metal brackets that attach it to the stone.  Beyond the battlement, lies the western domain of the Citadel in its ruined glory, left as testament to the fall of the mighty fortress."
