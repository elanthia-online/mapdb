      "Blue and white tiled floors and an elongated heart of pine dining table give the kitchen a welcoming, pastoral charm.  The aroma of freshly baked tarts infuses the air around a spotless, hammered bronze kettle perched upon a stout cast iron stove.  Innumerous copper pots and pans are suspended from staggered ceiling hooks, placed opposite some beveled silver beech cupboards and a steel-topped walnut serving cart."
