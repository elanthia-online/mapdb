      "Exquisite rose bushes of every known variety line the carefully manicured rows.  Crushed white gravel paths are defined with white trim boards, keeping the rock from straying too far away.  Couples drift idly along, stopping frequently to sniff the aromatic buds.  Beds of peonies, gardenias and carnations add extra variety, as do the daisy and delicate orchid plants."
