      "A small but thick grove of eucalyptus stands to one side of the path, a flock of red-tailed black cockatoos clinging to its branches.  Birds constantly fly to and from the trees, switching places and starting loud, raucous disputes about choice perching spots.  Rolling hills of heavy flaxen grasses stretch on around the area, fully surrounding the trees."
