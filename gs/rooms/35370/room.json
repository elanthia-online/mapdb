      "Stone steps wind through travertine terraces, rising alongside steaming mineral pools too hot for mortal flesh to enjoy.  The ancient stonework displays the marks of time, worn smooth by countless footsteps.  Carved into the rocky wall, a dragon's claw opens empty and inviting, its scales catching the starlight.  Iron lanterns hang from hooks, their stained glass panels casting vibrant reflections of red, blue, and green onto the travertine surfaces."
