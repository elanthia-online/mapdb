      "Spilling down from a slight incline to the southwest, dark sheet moss blankets the ground to provide a cushioned step that is springy and airy.  Creeping vines of patchwork-colored woodbine drape across boulders to either side of the path, while lavender, pink, and white rhododendron bushes lend a touch of softness to the dark hues that paint the landscape.  Partially covered by the foliage, a slender birch trunk with most of its bark peeled off rests amid red and orange fiddlehead ferns."
