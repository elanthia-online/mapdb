      "The area behind the stage is in disarray, with wooden props scattered about the floor while fanciful costumes are overflowing from iron-bound chests.  Bins of old paint rest near a few discolored wooden sets, their transformation still incomplete.  A few stools rest before a row of vanities, and a dim passageway leads back to the theatre's auditorium."
