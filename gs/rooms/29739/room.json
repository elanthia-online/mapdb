      "Five distinct piers made of water-roughened oak and teak come together to create a large docking structure with ample room for portage.  Cork and canvas bumpers pad each docking slip, and the soft sound of waves slapping against wooden support posts fills the air.  A carved driftwood sign reads, \"Drenched Thrak Pier - Slips 6-10.\""
