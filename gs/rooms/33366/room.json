      "Lofty vaulted ceilings above are inset with panels of crystal-clear glass revealing the arcing skyscape painting the heavens outside.  Adjacent to a beveled door and a narrow hallway, a motley crew of preserved beast heads hangs over a spacious rune-etched fireplace housed in an encasement of natural stonework.  Hunting-themed oil paintings in gold frames adorn the polished cypress walls with a rustic flair, yielding to a fauna-carved rowan arch on the eastern wall.  An overstuffed tartan couch is grouped with an oaken reading desk and a suede-lined wicker basket."
