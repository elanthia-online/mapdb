      "Giant piles of grain are neatly kept in enormous bins in this large storage facility encased by four walls of thick granite rock.  Against the far wall, a multi-tiered malting rack houses a thin layer of grain on each level that is being continually misted by workers.  Huge vats of water stand nearby, soaking ample quantities of oats and barley.  A steady flow of malt-laden carts pass through a reinforced invar arch to the west, only to return empty."
