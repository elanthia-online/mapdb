      "Thick canopies of black rolton hide are pulled tight to form the walls of the tent, with a singular curtain of bone beads leading out.  The ground is almost moist and black with old blood.  Piles of nibbled bones lie in a corner, flies buzzing around some gamey meat still clinging to greasy ligaments.  The air is heavy, almost suffocating."
