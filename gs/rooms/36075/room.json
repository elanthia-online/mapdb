      "Branching off the main pathway, this glade is interrupted by a gently bubbling brook.  Conifers crowd the edges of the green, bowing in to cast shadows over most of the open space, while the whistle of songbirds can be heard above the water's noise.  A simple cedarwood bridge arcs low over the brook, heading off towards a grassy knoll."
