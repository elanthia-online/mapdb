      "Painted green ivy meanders along the eaves of this cheery bedroom's whitewashed walls.  A green glass wash basin stands ready for use beside a large soft feather bed whose sheets have been embroidered to match the room's colorful eaves.  A delicate perfume of ocean salt and fresh flowers floats about the bedroom."
