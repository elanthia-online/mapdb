      "Facing off from opposite sides of the wagon are a sturdy wall-bracketed stand housing a variety of polearms and a wide floor-to-ceiling sword rack laden with goods.  A finely scripted parchment sign in a silver frame stands sentinel beside the ebonwood door set into the rear wall, and distorted shafts of light snake across the plum carpeting from the whorled crystal windows set near the ceiling."
