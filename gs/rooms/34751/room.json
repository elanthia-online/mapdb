      "Lurid tapestries of scarlet and milky green silk flutter overhead, making the humanoid forms they depict undulate and writhe.  Cushions in the same colors are strewn in uneven rows across the smooth marble floor, proceeding toward northbound steps clad in runners of sumptuous velvet.  In jade-framed niches along the walls, friezes depict bodies embracing and clambering atop one another while an exquisite woman shrouded in green smoke looks on."
