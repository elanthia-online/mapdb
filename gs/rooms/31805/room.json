      "The emerald-colored walls peel across the scratch marks on either side of a pine-framed curving archway, the haphazard slashes continuing along the narrow wooden door blending into the lasimor framework of the enclosure.  Stone-hewn nests adorn the railings of the wrought iron staircase, the marble cradles filled with ivoried bones fused with dark cloisonne.  A spiral wrought iron ladder leans across a parchment-filled wall, the anatomical sketchings highlighted in vivid scarlet ink."
