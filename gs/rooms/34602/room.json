      "Shadowed in deep indigo, the dark walls of the workshop are lit by a sextet of colored glass globes that hover and bob about the room.  A marble-topped workbench covers two sides of the chamber, its surface covered with every instrument, beaker, and apparatus imaginable.  A colorful glass mosaic is pressed into the central wall."
