      "Devoid of nearby furnishings, a black rose mural decorates the western wall under the light of several frosted glaesine globes that dangle from the ceiling.  Plush argent carpeting dappled with ebon threads lends the otherwise austere space a coziness that is enhanced by the presence of a dark plum crushed velvet settee.  A lacquered white door leads to the hallway, while a silver and black bourde curtain provides access to the storage facilities."
