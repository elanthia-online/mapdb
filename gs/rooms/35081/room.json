      "Garbed in a soot-stained blacksmith's apron, Bladeturner Agrakh stands proudly between matching racks on either side of the showroom.  Many of the armaments on display have carved bone hilts, while others are graced with a haft of dark wood.  The hammering of metal against metal resounds from a workspace in the back of the shop, and a ruddy glow from the forge intermittently illuminates the interior between the moving shadows of those busy at work."
