      "In the shadow of a rust-stained railing, the outline of a fallen sailor stains the deck, dried blood having left behind a silhouette that neither the sun nor the sea can leach from the wood.  Though there is no sign of the hapless mariner's remains, frayed ropes tangle across the deck alongside shattered barrels whose pungent odor suggests they once held salted fish.  A dilapidated helm, crumpled and corroded, stands like a lonely sentry near the deck's edge, looking out onto the shiftless waters."
