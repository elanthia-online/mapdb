      "A large table fills nearly half the room.  Sitting on the table is a detailed model of Teras Isle.  The town of Kharam-Dzu, the Fhorian Village, a volcano and lava flows--complete with club-wielding pyrothags--fills the tabletop.  At the far end of the table you can see a small ferry leading from the town to the Kiramon mines, and even a few miniature Kiramon poised near the mine entrance.  Winding its way across the landscape is what appears to be some sort of racetrack."
