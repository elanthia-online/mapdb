      "The thick fog wraps the area in a stifling cloud of wet mist.  Sounds are deadened and breathing becomes more labored in the heavy air.  The grass drips water, running down the blades to pool on the trail.  At this point the trail changes direction slightly, proceeding levelly to the west but rising gently to the northeast.  Lights of various colors appear far off in the distance to the northwest and south, just barely visible in the fog."
