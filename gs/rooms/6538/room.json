      "Shadows surround a massive stone fireplace standing next to the door.  The rock is coated with the grime and soot accumulated over years of use.  Next to it lies a massive slab of stone with deep holes drilled into it.  The room is silent except for a few chirps from birds nesting in the rafters overhead."
