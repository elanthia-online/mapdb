    "description": [
      "Pale ash poles lift the ceiling of the tent into four peaked corners, joined one to the other with slender framing beams, and are strung with webs of rough-spun twine between.  A narrow table sits toward the rear of the space, occupied by a row of small apothecary jars and mounted at one end by a well-used ash branch perch.  A mesh-domed cast iron brazier stands off to one corner, while a wide-lipped silver bowl cradled by a forked ash limb pedestal occupies the heart of the area."
