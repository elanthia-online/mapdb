      "The stone floor is tacky and red with the spillover from red fluid dripping down the eastern wall.  Due to the cant of the ground, the coagulating liquid has pooled at the feet of a carved figure recessed into the western wall.  The wild-haired female gigas statue looks little bothered by the flood."
