      "Patterns of swirling blue-green veins run through the variegated surface of the stone, pulsing with green-tinged light reminiscent of a sky made sickly with stormglow.  The lip of the disc is nearly parallel with the ocean's surface, which rages and surges just paces away, sending sheets of spray spattering onto the stone.  Between stone and sea is a plummet through the air down to the bared seafloor far below."
