      "Passing an unseen boundary, the tall grasses of the grasslands give way to bright yellow-green fescue that frames the beige tracks of the village.  Pockets of rock-strewn soil break through the turf where saussurea grows in thick clusters, its pale, downy blooms standing high above the scattered stones.  To the north, a small hill rises above the surrounding gers, its summit ringed with pennant-topped posts and crowned by a carefully built bonfire stack."
