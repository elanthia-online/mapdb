      "Jagged rocks and boulders litter the floor, many strewn with the large, shed skins of lizards announcing their status as favored rubbing spots.  A small pool releases steam into the tunnel, making the air quite stifling and almost unbearably hot.  Fresh droppings beside the water lend a noxious odor to the moisture-laden air."
