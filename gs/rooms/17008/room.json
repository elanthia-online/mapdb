      "The crack leading into this cave is narrow and pointed at the bottom, but it widens toward the top to allow the entrance of even the largest of beasts.  A cold, black rivulet cuts a deep channel across the cave floor and tumbles out onto the trail outside.  Tree branches and a collection of other odds and ends, both from nature and civilization, have been woven clumsily into a huge nest that straddles the brackish water."
