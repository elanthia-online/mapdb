      "Chipped, pale pink, raised panels enclose this entrance hall with sliding doors closing off the two side rooms to the east and west.  Sideboards have been pressed up against the mold-coated walls around a round center table, each surface holding various dolls.  A wide set of stairs leads up to a small landing where a single door sits.  Broken, unadorned dolls hang from miniature nooses from the railings."
