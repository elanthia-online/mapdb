      "Imported Terasian glaes statuary stands stoically behind the brass-accented desk of the Guildmaster.  A wrought-iron rack lined in velvet houses several precious instruments while the stone shelf behind it contains numerous tomes and manuscripts.  Displayed on the deep blue granite walls are a series of detailed oil paintings and illuminated scrolls from famous dwarven writers."
