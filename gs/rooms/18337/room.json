      "The shadowy form of the mountain rising in the north dominates here as the jungle terrain thins to the edge of the coastal cliffs.  Moonlight shimmers on the dark surface of the ocean below the cliffs, and only a small portion of the southern expanse of beach is discernable through the dark shadows brought by the night.  The salty scent of ocean breeze teases the senses, and the wind whistles eerily through the few defiant trees and patches of grass still clinging to the rock-laden soil.",
      "The view of the mountain rising in the north dominates here as the jungle terrain thins to the edge of the coastal cliffs.  A breathtaking view of the ocean below is limited to the southern expanse of the beach as the prominent curve of the northwest coastline hinders further sight.  The salty scent of ocean breeze permeates the cliff, and the wind dances over the few defiant trees and patches of grass growing within the rock-laden soil."
