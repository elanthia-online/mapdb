      "A narrow tunnel leads down into the ocean, its walls covered with glass.  The undersea passageway provides a view of the ocean life beneath the waves.  Large murky shapes move about in the distance while nearby a troupe of sea creatures, including a red lobster, a blow fish, a seahorse and some star fish play tiny instruments while watching you pass."
