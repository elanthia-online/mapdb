      "The dim chamber is steeped in gloom, lit only by the streaks of light filtering through cracks in the ceiling beams.  Burlap sacks slump against the walls, their bulging forms crowding between tarnished trunks and a line of mismatched cabinets with warped drawers half-ajar.  The web-strung beams overhead creak with each clammy draft, while the warped floorboards bear scuff marks and dark, grimy streaks."
