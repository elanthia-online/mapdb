      "Hidden behind the fractured door, this dry cramped space holds a few levels of broken, leaning and fallen shelving.  The air is still and heavy, carrying with it the scent of mold and disuse.  The floor in the closet is cluttered with broken planks, jars and shards of pottery, while a heavy wooden rack still holds a few damaged tools."
