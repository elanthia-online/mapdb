      "Much of the wall of the cavern above has given away and collapsed into rubble near the tiered base of the plaza, exposing a fossil that spans nearly the length of the cavern.  Some glossy black bones, half lost in the darkness of the subterranean grotto's upper reaches, spread in unearthly configurations across the wall.  They suggest a creature of terrible size and horrific configuration, multitudinous arms and spread wings trapped as bony impressions within the ancient rock."
