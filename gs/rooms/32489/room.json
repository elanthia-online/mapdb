      "Guarded by an abandoned watch post, an unimpressive servant's entrance occupies a bend in the castle's walls.  Crates and barrels, some emitting powerful aromas of rot and fetor, sit by a pair of double doors that lead into the castle.  One barrel has begun to leak, exuding a sappy black substance that stinks intensely of death."
