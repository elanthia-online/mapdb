      "Bright-berried yew trees line the street, muffling the sounds of merrymaking echoing from the nearby gaming hall.  The bright rowhouses of Porter Street give way to wider boarding houses with balconies protected by wrought iron rail.  One tennant flies a pennant of giantkin tartan, while another has a ship's flag draped from their balcony.",
      "The sounds of gaiety from the Silvermule are slightly muffled by the yew trees lining the street.  The bright row houses down on Porter Street have been replaced by slightly wider stucco boarding houses, apparently the homes for many of the Silvermule's workers."
