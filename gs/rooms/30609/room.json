    "description": [
      "Built kitty-corner between a sun-crested stockade fence and a railing-guarded cliff, a two-story whitewashed shop sits within a field of shaggy grass.  Large windows of stained glass, comically depicting a colorful halfling baker, rest in the face of the white-washed structure, as does a bright red door that has been left partially open.  Just to the right of the building, a sturdy knotty pine staircase leads to the second story."
