    "description": [
      "Wind sweeps across the tundra as it departs from high granite peaks in the distance towards the low valley, its gossamer fingers causing a nearby strand of spindle-trunked birch to rattle and sway.  Colorful leaves of verdant and gold hues dapple the reed-thin boughs, generating a soft whisper that carries through the area.  Bristle-headed black sedge and wide-bladed alpine grass mingles together across the slight incline as it travels south, while a narrow track winds its way further up the mound to the north."
