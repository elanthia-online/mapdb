    "description": [
      "An elderly dwarf dressed in plate armor stands stiffly directly in front of the stone arch leading north from this short stretch of tunnel.  Dwarves pass by him, yet he neither looks right or left, his gaze fixed on some object in the distance.  A pair of large stone pots flank the arch, and the glow from their toadstools fills the area with a radiant, amber illumination.  To the south the tunnel widens out into a massive cavern."
