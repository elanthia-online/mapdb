      "As the path progresses, the carpet of grass at its borders lengthens from a short shear to a lush, thick pile where its conveyance ends at a wrought iron gate.  The verdure rises in full sprays at the base of each post of an age-darkened split rail fence that encloses a livery yard.  Beyond the barrier stands a rustic dark green stable with high, arched roofing and dark green walls that blend with the verdant surroundings."
