      "Behind a juniper-framed stall, glowing coals spread wide across a shallow but elongated pit, their heat feeding a dozen blackened pots and iron skillets.  Steam rises in fragrant waves from simmering broths thick with noodles and woven steam baskets resting atop pots.  The scent of rendered meat, mild dough, and toasted spice carries into the surrounding meadow.  Bunches of peppers dry above the embers, their skins glowing faintly in the firelight."
