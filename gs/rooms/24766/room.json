      "Glancing around this vast room, you see a huge dragon-shaped brazier to your right -- clearly the source of the warmth that envelops you.  A thick fur rug in the center of the hardwood floor looks so inviting that you are tempted to bend down just to feel its softness.  A soft leather sofa with oversized cushions and down-filled pillows stands next to the wooden door leading out, completing an invitation for you to relax."
