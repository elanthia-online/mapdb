      "The waters of the nearby stream run swiftly, with numerous jagged rocks jutting out and creating swirling eddies.  The ground along the shore appears to be of a rich silt, and brilliant blue plumbago shrubs line the banks and wrap themselves about the cinchona trees shading the path.  A carved sign has been placed where the foliage clears somewhat to allow for the best view of the stream."
