      "Rose bushes line the greenway encircling a small court at the street's end, suffusing the air with their velvety perfume.  Benches along the court's exterior provide respite, though they and the cobblestones are littered with vivid crimson petals.  A small fountain wrought to resemble two lovers embracing spills musically into a shallow marble basin.  Nearby, a mossy brick retaining wall tangled with ivy protects a small, secluded tea shop."
