      "Three large carts have been abandoned in the center of the alley and now serve as a playground for a number of merry children whose laughter echoes over the sound of hurried footsteps.  Roughly constructed stone houses are packed closely together along the sides of the way.  Another alley breaks off to the northeast.",
