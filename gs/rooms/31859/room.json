    "description": [
      "Dark green hedges with rime-touched briars grow tall and thick, separating the area from the town beyond, and dozens of fruit trees grow in perfectly neat rows along one side of a wide cobblestone path.  Across the path, several cozy homes are scattered across a tree-strewn meadow and tucked amidst the edge of the hedges.  Several smaller walkways lead off the main path to more distant structures, and the main path forks widely, offering a choice between southeasterly and southwesterly."
