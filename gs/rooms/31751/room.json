      "Ornately framed glass mirrors hang above a row of bourde-covered benches and walnut dressing tables laid out with a variety of brushes and grooming tools.  Behind a painted silk screen partition, washbasins filled with warm, scented water sit atop a low cupboard containing a neat stack of face cloths.  The scent of eucalyptus seeps through a tall marble arch, a glimpse of a steaming pool of water visible beyond its border."
