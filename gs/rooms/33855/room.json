      "The tall lattice-curved arches frame the ends of the ebony-planked pier, the ivy-draped trellises suspending a vine-framed haon sign between the unfurling grey-washed roses.  A series of nautical maps sketched in vivid pigments are affixed to an ironwood board, protected by a panel of clear glass flanked by a duo of open signal fans.  A wrought silver-traced bench sits beside a stack of hemp-bound crates, the containers branded in a port-encircled cityscape."
