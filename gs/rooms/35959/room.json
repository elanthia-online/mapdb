      "Polished brass fixtures gleam against walls paneled in dark cherry wood, their shine softened by candlelight from a conspiracy of black vaalin raven sconces with outstretched wings.  At the center of the chamber rests an ink-veined grey marble tub of considerable size, its rim carved with serpentine patterns, while the base is a sculpted sea of waves frozen in mid-crash.  A stack of folded white linen towels are tucked underneath a lacquered fel washstand set with an oval smoky nacre basin."
