      "A slight breeze travels through the clearing, sending a whisper through the tall grass and bringing with it the dull dank odor of moist mud.  A nearby oak has been strung with woven cords, which dangle lazily from its branches, waving softly in the breeze.  Each cord ends in a thick knot, and broken shards of earthenware pottery protrude from the bare ground within the shadow of the tree.",
