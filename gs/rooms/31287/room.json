      "A wide path cuts its way through the grass on either side, making its way towards a copse of trees of various types and sizes.  To one side of the path is a large wooden sign, cleverly carved to appear as if it is being held by a small pile of grinning Iyo children.  Overhead, fireflies flare to life in random patterns, forming incidental constellations that fade nearly immediately."
