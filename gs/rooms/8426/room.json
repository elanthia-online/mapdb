      "The thin path continues along the underground stream, the path treacherous and twisted as it skirts a forest of stalactites.  Below, in the thin cut, faint illumination creates odd reflections that dance upon the surface of the water.  Muffled quakes shatter the silence at random intervals and send up clouds of dust, but there is no trace of their source."
