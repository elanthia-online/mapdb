      "Large stones mark the border of the clearing and stand out brightly against the rich hues of the encroaching jungle.  Occupying one corner of the clearing is a series of tangled vines that have grown together in mimicry of a tree.  Coarse, round kiwifruits dangle from their spindled blossoms amid ruffled yellow flowers and bright white blossoms with yellow hearts."
