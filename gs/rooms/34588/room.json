      "A column of rich jade-hued energy illuminates the room, its colors swirling about their invisible cage, causing the walls to glisten as the light fans out, sending prismatic colors over the stone.   At the foot of an archway lined in ironwood, a mysterious inscription in an unknown language appears to glow softly with a pulsating white light, opposite to a beautifully detailed carving."
