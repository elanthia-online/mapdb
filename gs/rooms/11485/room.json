      "Deep grass extends all the way to the stony reef to the south.  Waves crash into the reef, sending up a white plume of salt spray.  The magnificent, white-capped expanse of Maelstrom Bay is spread out before you.  The reef extends to the southwest, beyond which can be seen a portion of the forested mainland and a sliver of the island of River's Rest."
