      "Breaches in the cragged ceiling reveal a winding bridge of stone passing over the tunnel as it delves deeper into the earth.  Both are illuminated by cascades of glowing fungus that drape the walls, thriving off of the moisture and mineral-rich stone.  Despite the profusion of shimmering fungi, the pathway is dim and made treacherous by a skim of water that slicks the rocky floor."
