      "Floral patterns in rose and cream velvet frame the windows of this delightfully private chamber.  Enclosed with a canopy and curtains of sheer lace, a large bed rests opposite a fireplace which burns with a cheerful light.  In front of the fireplace, there is a soft fur rug.  A delicately carved oak sideboard stands alongside the gold door."
