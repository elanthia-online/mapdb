    "description": [
      "Sugarcane grows in plenitude to either side of the loamy walk, its grassy sweetness almost lost amid the glut of aromas flooding the jungle at its verges.  The rich scent of rain-dampened earth strives for attention amid the strident perfume of wildflowers.  A towering blue stone arch rises out of vines and tangled brush, its weathered surface streaked with lichen and moss.  Shafts of golden sunlight pierce the cracked keystone, illuminating heavy air thick with mist."
