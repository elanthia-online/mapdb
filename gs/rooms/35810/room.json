      "Redwood planks with slight gaps form a solid deck over the limestone ledge, atop which sits an outdoor relaxation bath.  A heavy chain attached to a metal pipe jutting out from the cave wall hovers over a holding tank leading to a punched steel disk suspended at one end of the bathing vessel.  Giant tanik trees surround the outdoor setting, creating a privacy screen, admitting beams of moonlight.  The scented air of the forest and rushing waterfall nearby contribute a relaxing vibration while one reclines neck-deep in hot water."
