      "A small stand of trees protruding out from the main forest forms a place of refuge from the constant wind.  The tree trunks are scarred and gouged from their bases to a height of about ten feet.  A soft layer of pine needles blankets the ground, and the snow tends to pile up outside the stand, leaving the layer of needles relatively dry and providing a good place for travelers to bed down for the night.  Someone has even set up a small fire pit under the trees."
