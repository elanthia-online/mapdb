      "The large hold of the ship is partitioned off with rickety shelves, tattered sailcloth curtains, and a rusty string of small cannons.  Four tables are set up closest to the stairs leading back up, one displaying armor, another with weapons, the third cluttered with magic items, and the final one overflowing with odd bits of miscellany."
