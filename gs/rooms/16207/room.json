    "description": [
      "A richly embroidered, tasseled canopy, stained from salt spray and faded from long exposure to the elements, stretches over the cockpit, providing welcome shade from the sun.  There is an aura of immense age about the longship.  The decks of dark thanot are sunbleached and heavily grained.  The top of the tall mast is difficult to see against the bright sun.  Standing on the aftdeck, one hand on the tiller, is the longship captain."
