      "Cozy homes connected by tiny paths and rustic gardens fill the area, a small road wending its way past them all.  Tiny aragless spheres strung between cherrywood poles refract ambient light, and neatly trimmed hedges block the woods from encroaching into the enclave.  To the southeast, farms and fields are visible."
