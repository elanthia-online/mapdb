      "Dark brown walls of canvas are pulled taut along several wooden posts, providing a wide center floor for the command pavilion.  A large cot occupies one corner, a heavy ermine blanket tossed haphazardly upon it.  Dominating the middle of the tent is a huge modwir table littered with dozens of maps, carved wooden miniatures, empty scroll tubes, and a shrunken skull paperweight."
