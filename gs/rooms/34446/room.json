      "Large glass windows dominate the southern wall, providing the window seat that rests before it with an uninterrupted view of the streets below.  Surrounded by doily-covered tables, a large doublewide bed covered in decorative quilts rests its headboard against the pale yellow walls of soft linen.  Creating a focal point within the room, a large armoire with carved headers and footers stretches to the ceiling in full view of the open double-wide doors."
