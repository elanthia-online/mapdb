      "From a small platform high up in the lor tree, stars twinkle like countless pinpricks across an endless ebon sky, the view stretching from mountains to endless wooded plains.  A pair of great horned owls swoop through the trees, hunting for prey, their melodic hoots echoing throughout the forest at a hypnotic tempo.  Carved on the silver tree trunk are some ancient runes.  A tightly-woven hemp ladder hangs over the edge of the platform.",
      "At the top of a tightly-woven hemp ladder, a small platform rises above the treeline, providing a spectacular view.  A pair of great horned owls tend to their young in a nest on a nearby branch.  Broken hatchling shells are scattered around the nest amongst fresh pellets and molted feathers.  Carved on the silver tree trunk are some ancient runes."
