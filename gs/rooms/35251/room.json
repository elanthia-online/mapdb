      "Steps carved from white travertine create a transitional space between the sprawling dock system and the rocky shoreline.  A weathered wooden sign directs visitors to the harbor master's shed nearby.  The shed itself is a quaint structure with a red-tiled roof and an ornate iron lantern hanging by the door.  Nearby, a small crate filled with fishing nets and tools is arranged as if the pieces have been placed out to dry."
