      "Several ebony silk umbrellas provide a modicum of shade above a quartet of lacquered haon tables, the chairs scattered before an ecru stucco shop displaying glazed teapots from faenor hooks.  Teacup-shaped pots dot the perimeter of the area, spilling fragrant blossoms across the cobblestones, tiny honeybees flitting to each in turn.  The indistinct sounds of an ayr and tambourine echo across the walls, the melody followed by a round of voices singing softly in unison."
