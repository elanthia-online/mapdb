      "A slender spire of stone rises from the flat rock of the islet, its sheer sides pockmarked with crevices that host a chaotic collection of nests.  Drab seabirds circle warily overhead, while smaller terns dart swiftly to and fro, filling the air with a cacophony of cries.  Below, monk seals bob gently amid the surf, occasionally dipping beneath the azure waves that unrelentingly batter the islet's shores."
