      "Huge, ruddy stone steps descend into unleavened darkness, framed on either side by high walls of the same rust-colored rock.  Dim light from the fane's entrance illuminates primitive paintings on the distant ceiling, revealing rudimentary scenes of battle and conquest.  The steps are slightly damp and tacky."
