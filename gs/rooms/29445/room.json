      "Large swathes of multi-hued silk and velvet cloth cover the walls, draped with mithril chains dangling an assortment of well-used wands and divination cards.  Hanging from the ceiling, a rickety wooden orrery with dusty gemstone moons casts a flickering shadow across a mahogany chest and a matching jewelry case.  Tucked into one corner is a salt-stained velvet and silk curtain adorned with hundreds of beads."
