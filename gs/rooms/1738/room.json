    "description": [
      "A wide crack yawns in the glacier, running in a jagged pattern west and northwest until it reaches the mountains.  The sides of the crack are sharp and solid.  Small rocks dropped into the crevice bounce against the sides and disappear into the darkness, never indicating when they hit bottom.  Much of the southeastern end is covered in snow, but a judicious circumvention of the area, walking near to the mountains, provides a safe path."
