      "Resembling more a salon than a parlor, the tiny room has bright yellow and white flowers painted on the walls and tiny teardrop lanterns that dangle from the white rafters.  Couches and settees are pushed to one side so that the center of the living space can proudly display a row of mannequin heads that rests upon a long table.  Tiny jewelry boxes have been placed to the right of each decorated head, while to the left are several paper hat boxes painted with bright red roses."
