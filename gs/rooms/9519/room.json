      "The bone slope funnels tightly between a granite wall on the east and a granite pillar on the west, dropping to the north and northwest while rising to the south and southwest.  A dark opening recedes into the stone high up on the granite wall, but there appears to be no way to scale the wall and reach the opening.  The remains of a rope ladder, twisted and brittle, entwine around the bones at the base of the wall, but nothing hangs down from above."
