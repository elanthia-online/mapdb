      "A colony of bats nests overhead, as evidenced by a small scattering of guano that litters a section of the plaza.  The tiny, furry creatures swarm about a cleft in the ceiling, eyes glinting in the uneven light.  The surrounding stone is fastidiously clean, as if the area is otherwise regularly maintained."
