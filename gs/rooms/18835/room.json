      "Elongated and protected by a low edging of wild roses and young willows, the point is more sandbar than land from the constant lapping of the river water against this sliver of a beach.  Barely wide enough for a two to walk side-by-side, small pebbles and larger stones make a hazardous path along the water's edge.  Moonlight catches on the lapping tide, creating a diamond-like sparkle as it reflects the pale light.  A gradual climb to the southeast leads up into forested growth.",

Barely wide enough for a two to walk side-by-side, small pebbles and larger stones make a hazardous path along the water's edge.  Bits of dark wood have washed up, some wet and glistening in the sunlight, others dried and dull.  A gradual climb to the southeast leads up into forested growth."
