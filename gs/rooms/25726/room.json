      "Lofty mangroves, their spindle-limbed roots rising high out of the salty lake at the center of the enclosure, provide homes for several species of exotic birds.  Emerald green, cobalt blue, and bright white in plumage, the birds range in size from no larger than a fist to the size of a large shield.  Faint snoring sounds can be heard from the various species that are nestled in slumber throughout the rookery."
