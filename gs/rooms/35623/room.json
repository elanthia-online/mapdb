      "A rugged outcrop of volcanic rock juts sharply from the sand, its craggy surface home to small scuttling crabs and noisy seabirds.  Waves break around its base in crashes of niveous foam, leaving behind glistening white trails on the bordering sand.  A few smaller humps of rock lead toward a steep cliff face to the east that is curtained in knots of blooming green vines."
