      "While the cellar is quite large, crates and boxes cover most of the eastern stone wall.  Set standing in the center of the room are two modwir racks, separated by a gleaming suit of full plate armor, which looms in guardianship over the proceedings.  An elaborate sigil has been etched into the stone of the southern wall, marked between two brocade tapestries that display the Militia's coat-of-arms.  A reinforced steel and iron door sits on the western wall abutting an upwards-leading set of steps."
