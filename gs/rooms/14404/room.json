      "Situated at the top of some rounded riverstone steps, the hallway is long and lushly carpeted.  Its northern wall is dominated by a muraled alcove, the vivid greens and shadowy blues of which provide a contrasting backdrop to a wide-mouthed dark jade jug.  At the hallway's end stands a pair of stained glass doors, the semi-translucent crystal panes adequately concealing the chamber beyond."
