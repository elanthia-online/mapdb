      "A floor-to-ceiling mirror framed in black-lacquered wings has been affixed to the vert-colored walls opposite of the wrought iron railing, the looking glass half-concealed by a curtain of tatted dark lace.  Graduated clay pots of tangled ivy obscure an ebonwood-framed door, the tapered ends withering beneath a vertical birdcage nestled in the far corner.  Wisps of brittle webs float on ethereal currents across the wainscotted paneling affixed above the geometric design adorning the floor below."
