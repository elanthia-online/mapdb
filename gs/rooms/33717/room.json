      "Thick panes of glaesineth covered in moisture fit into sturdy bronze supports that form the structure of the glasshouse with a labyrinth of copper piping and wiring following the bracing.  A raised herb garden, filled with fragrant plants, lines the pebbled walkways, while narrow wooden counters of potted orchids dominate the outside of the space.  A large worktable rests against the back wall next to a mistwood and glaesineth door, while small braziers tucked into the corners keep the air heated."
