      "Basket fungus branches into massive round and oval balls, giant sculptures handcrafted by nature.  Tinting the bone white frames with delicate hues, pastel orbs of light weave in and out of the geometrical latticework.  Whisper-thin mycelium threads split into countless forks as they spread across the moisture-laden path, redolent of pulled cotton."
