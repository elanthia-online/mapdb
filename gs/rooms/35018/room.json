      "As it crests a grassy hilltop dotted with snow, the roadway splits at a round black boulder.  The stone is taller than most of the scant trees dotting the landscape.  Eastward the road rambles, widening as it makes a descent toward volcanic flats in the far distance.  A smaller trail winds off to the northwest before it is lost in a small alpine meadow."
