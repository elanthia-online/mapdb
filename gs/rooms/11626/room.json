      "The quagmire on either side of the boggy pathway is filled with rot-blackened willows, bare-branched grey birches and bark-damaged monirs.  Tall brown grass has been trodden into the muck beside the path.  Somewhere nearby, hidden by the ash-grey fog, can be heard the trickle of creek water."
