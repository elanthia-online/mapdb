      "The interior of this dwelling is filled with treasures of the sea, some clearly weathered from exposure and brine.  Myriad maps of Elanthia and its oceans decorate the walls, and a rack high above holds a plethora of trinkets just out of reach of even the tallest giantman.  The cracked statue of a human magister is displayed in one corner, adjacent to a makeshift wooden counter used to conduct business with a fidgety krolvin elder who keeps a vigilant watch over her collected hoard of goods."
