      "The battered teak dock makes an abrupt right angle turn, reducing the capacity for docking vessels somewhat.  A colorful sea glass kraken cuddled up with a bevy of merpeople has been inlaid into the center of the deck with the phrase, \"Something for everyone at the Great Piratical Flotilla,\" carved beneath it.  Barnacle-encrusted posts and seaweed-covered bumpers mark off individual docking slips."
