    "description": [
      "Cobbled with white pavers and sporadically dotted with blue and green fieldstones, the avenue passes through the residential area of Vornavis between both the eastern and western curtain walls.  Growing less densely populated, the homes are in a chalet style and surrounded by cultivated hedges and manicured lawns.  Flower-festooned baskets hang from broad lampposts topped with frosted glass orbs, the lacquered wrought iron glittering in the lamplight."
