      "The dark, tannic water of the reed-choked creek moves just enough to keep it from becoming completely stagnant.  The ribs of a collapsed bridge jut out of the scummy water.  The creek banks are steep and slippery.  Overhead, just out of reach, the denuded trunk of a tree spans the creek.  To the south the creek becomes an impassable slough."
