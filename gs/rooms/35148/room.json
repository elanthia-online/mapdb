      "The walls, paneled in rich mahogany, are lined with towering bookshelves that hold ancient vellum tomes bound in shadowy leather.  A large desk of blackened bloodwood sits at the center, its neatly ordered parchments pushed aside in favor of a single crimson orb atop a black ora stand.  Dimly lit by flickering candles in wrought-iron holders, the room is cast in a soft, ruddy glow, while the air is thick with the scent of burning incense."
