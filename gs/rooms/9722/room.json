      "Opposite the golden expanse of a meadow to the north, a huge tree sits on the southern horizon, filling the sky with its monstrous canopy.  To either side of it rise dark cliffs, creating an impassable barrier behind the oak.  The trail has become gravelly, its course made laborious by rubble and rock, and clumps of nettles armed with prodigious thorns.",
