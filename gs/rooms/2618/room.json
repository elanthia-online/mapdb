      "A stout wooden wall impedes your progress forward.  In the center of the wall, on a large yellowed parchment, is a poster.  The poster is a side view of a man laying in a coffin or box of some kind.  Small arrows point to parts of the picture, and in an unknown language describe some of the things in it.  A second, older poster next to the first has the picture of an old, one-eyed dark elf with the number \"12000\" below it."
