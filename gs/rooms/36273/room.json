      "Plenty of torches line the walls of the barracks, illuminating the area sharply.  Four thick stone pillars are scattered across the room to support the ceiling, each displaying the Militia's coat-of-arms upon golden tapestries.  Several tables and chairs are bunched up in the center of the room, offering plenty of seating while simple cots and cotton hammocks line the walls for those who need rest.  Pushed up against the eastern wall is an iron and modwir credenza."
