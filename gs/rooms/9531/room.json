    "description": [
      "A wide chasm yawns from wall to wall, effectively cutting off travel to the east.  Occasionally a bone spills into the chasm, glancing off the walls with a thwacking sound on its way down, yet there is no clattering sound as one would expect to hear when it hits bottom.  A dark spot looms across the chasm, but it is too far away to tell if it is a grotto or merely a wide, curved spot of darker granite on the opposite wall."
