      "The robust scent of coffee beans fills the room, the heavy canvas-stitched sacks obscuring the vibrantly inked murals lining the walls of the shop.  A wyvern-carved mahogany display stands beneath a hammered fortress-etched shield, flanked by a pair of feather-filled crates, the containers guarded by crossed spears angled upward towards the brass-framed lanterns above."
