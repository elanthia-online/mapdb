      "Near a bend in the tunnel, the rocky ground is spiderwebbed through with cracks as if it has buckled beneath great pressure or force.  The source of the impact appears to be a shallow burrow occupied by clusters of clear eggs, each roughly the size of a full-grown dwarf.  Within each egg, a large vermiform shape is ensconced, twitching and throbbing.  The unborn worms' movements are illuminated by the glow of clustered ochre crystals sprouting from the walls."
