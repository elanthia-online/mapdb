      "Pendulum lanterns of frosted glass dangle from the lofty ceiling of bright blue azure, each creating bright pools of golden sunlight.  Grass green floorboards, swept clean and left uncluttered, support a long, oak counter where weapons are displayed within the pools of light.  Stained glass decorates the edges of the large picture window that gazes out on the dirty thoroughfare, while a radiant sun in goldenrod and dandelion yellow fills the door's frame."
