      "The well-trodden, broad paths in this part of the camp are marked by scattered pieces of gravel with tufts of brown grass and patches of withered weeds poking out around them.  Here and there, a few boulders and assorted smaller rocks serve as makeshift monuments or provisional gravemarkers, while off to one side, a flimsy ramp leads up to a two-story wooden construction."
