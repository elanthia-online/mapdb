      "Surrounded by shaggy broom sedge and feathery nassella grass, a yawning portal cuts into the very bedrock of the cliff face and is surrounded by cultivated black basket wythe.  Several wide, grey stone slabs form steps that lead to the deep, turquoise-blue waters of a crescent-shaped beach of pristine white sands, while the sun-bleached planks of narrow boardwalks stretch east and west through the sheltering grass.  A copper-banded barrel is tucked against a sheer stone wall, with a sign reading \"Keep Our Neighborhood Clean\" tacked to it."
