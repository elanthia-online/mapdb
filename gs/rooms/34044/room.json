      "Toward the eastern end of the gallery, huge steps of dark stone descend toward another thoroughfare along the cavern's eastern wall.  Smaller steps have been carved amidst the greater ones to ease the way for folk with shorter strides.  Balconies that are nearly the size of plazas jut out high overhead, supported by graceful arcs of carved stone shaped to resemble clouds and flames.  Hexagonal bronze braziers light the walk, fed by pine wood that fills the air with the effervescent bite of its resin."
