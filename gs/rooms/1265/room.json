      "The view from atop this boulder is not spectacular by any means.  The monotonous grassland spreads out all around.  After about thirty yards of this same scene, mists choke off the view entirely, encasing the area like a grey dome.  Pockets of water dot the surface of the boulder, and footing is a bit tricky on the slick surface.  The trail runs off straight and true to the west from below the boulder, and here, on the boulder's top, the trail in the other direction becomes readily apparent."
