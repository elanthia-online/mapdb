      "Vine-covered ceilings of green-tinged glaesine, canted to form a high peak, filter moonlight down to the potted healing herbs lining the walls.  Cast in night shadows, four small curtained arches lead off the main hallway, and ornate intaglios cover the limestone walls, an unusual blend of healing and alchemical motifs.",
      "Sunlight filters through vine-covered ceilings of green-tinged glaesine, dappling the pale acantha green sandstone floors.   Numerous potted healing herbs line the walls, taking advantage of the influx of daylight, and four small curtained arches lead off the main hallway.  Ornate intaglios cover the limestone walls, an unusual blend of healing and alchemical motifs."
