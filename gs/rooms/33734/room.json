      "Terracotta tiles of varying shades are set into the floor, their edges forming interwoven diagonal patterns, dark and light hues twinning.  A few potted ferns rest about the room between several benches, each cushioned with woven blue and green silk pillows.  Driftwood sculptures hang on either side of a small obsidian blackboard."
