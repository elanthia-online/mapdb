      "A large white pine desk stretches across the center of the office, covered with scattered papers and pots of ink.  A rug-covered plank floor leads to a towering oak bookshelf behind the desk, which is littered with parchments and volumes, as well as a curious collection of bottled starfishes.  On the far wall is a framed blueprint of Four Winds Isle covered in tiny, red X's."
