      "Blending smoothly with the creamy marble of the entryway floor, the grey-veined marble continues into the center of this winding hallway, flanked on each side with pale oak floorboards.  Rose scented oil burns in a carefully suspended sconce, casting a warm glow over a walnut sideboard.  Resting atop the sideboard, a shallow cut glaes bowl contains an artistic arrangement of floating candles and rose blossoms."
