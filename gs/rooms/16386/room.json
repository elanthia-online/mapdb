      "A wall-mounted blowfish hangs on one of the blue-speckled sea glass walls, and a low skylight-set ceiling rises overhead.  An ornate bottled ship sits in one corner of a swirled sea glass floor.  There is some carved haon pegs on one side of the shop and a long mistwood counter on the other."
