    "description": [
      "The ground slopes to the southeast toward a stagnant, weed-choked pond.  The graves show the same abuse as the rest of the burial grounds.  Tombstones and grave markers dot the ground, either toppled on their sides or crumbled to pieces of stone.  A partially submerged stone statue pokes out of the pond, its features too worn to make out."
