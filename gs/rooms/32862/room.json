      "Framed by walls of polished basalt, this room's cool elegance is softened by silvery wool carpets woven with a deep blue geometric design.  Comfortable wing chairs upholstered with deep blue leather are drawn up around a silver-veined marble hearth, above which is set a silver-framed beveled glaes mirror.  Flanked by twin green banners, a silver-veined marble bar fills one corner.  Above the silver arch leading into this lounge, a blue quartz medallion gleams softly in the light."
