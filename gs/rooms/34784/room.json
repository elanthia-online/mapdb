      "Large rectangular boulders have been placed along the roadside to provide a temporary sanctuary for weary travelers.  The adjacent trees have thinned just enough to allow spectators to view the sky, but even more evident is the thickness of the forest, not so far away.  Far from the bothersome traffic, this respite could even serve well as a camp for a large caravan."
