    "description": [
      "Arched beams of polished yew support the high peaked roof of the high hall, each carved with a pattern reminiscent of winding scales.  The air is warm and close and heavily tinged with char, and above, a colossal draconic head of carved spruce looks down over the entryway with cruelly narrowed eyes.  Rough-hewn stairs rise from the stone floor toward a dais in the north, which appears to be source of the heat and flickering firelight that casts the entryway in such ominous shadow."
