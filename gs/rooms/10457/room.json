      "A gentle rise gives the impression of being able to overlook the entire area.  In the daylight, the walls of the outer keep can be visibly seen to both the west and south, along with the imposing view of the greater walls of the inner keep to the north.  A winding path of sorts snakes its way between the enterprising merchants who have set up tents on the incline of this small hillock.",
