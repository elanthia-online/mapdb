      "Bright candy-striped walls enclose the pastel-colored shop, the long marble counters covered in tiered racks of gold and silver wire.  In the center of the room stands a monocle-adorned octopus statue, its curled arms displaying a multitude of blown glass bowls, the vessels cradled between polychromatic streamers of silk ribbon.  Chain-draped lanterns shaped like inverted ice cream cones are scattered throughout the shop, casting vivid flashes of light across the planked floor."
