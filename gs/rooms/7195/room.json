      "The land is level here, away from the main graveyard.  A few slab-like stone monoliths lie fallen in a rough semicircle on the grass, part of a ruined funerary gate honoring some past hero.  Had they remained standing, they would form a perfect frame through which could be seen a large dirt mound to the east.  Southwest is a dark lowland dotted by broken tombstones."
