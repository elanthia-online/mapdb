      "This corner of the workshop is far darker than the others, and a musty smell suffuses the area.  Sounds are muffled here, as the plethora of books and tomes act as dampeners for any echo they encounter.  Bookshelves sag under the weight of various tomes, a desk is piled high with scrolls, and various crates lining the floor are stuffed full of paper.  There's a layer of dust over most things, though the sheer amount of books and various tomes makes this area feel rather crowded.",
      "Remnants of a faint musty smell are quickly drowned out by an assault of dried flora and herbs, dozens upon dozens of bundles loosely tied to the ceiling above.  A cacophony of clicks and whirrs emanate from behind stacks of books and tomes, the occasional cog dropping down into the piles of junk, forever lost to the ether.  Slapdash stools and tables have been built from a number of tomes, their humidity-dampened spines sagging dramatically from alternate use."
