      "A panoply of unusual and eclectic items are stacked high against the walls of this gloomy room.  A wan light casts a feeble, flickering glow over dusty wares, leaving several heavy shadows mostly undisturbed.  The center of the room is dominated by a hulking wrought iron birdcage that stands within a wide circle notably free of debris.  An ornate sign at the base of the cage proudly proclaims, \"The Aviary,\" elegantly etched in Common."
