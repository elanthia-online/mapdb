      "Great grey bins of salt line the stone walls of the warehouse.  Tucked away in one corner is a small refreshment stand with a cluster of dwarves and other travelers surrounding it.  The air here is dry and white salt crystals are tracked everywhere across the floor, even spilling out the wide sliding metal door that leads into the main tunnels."
