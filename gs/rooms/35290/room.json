    "description": [
      "Sheltered from the elements by terracotta tiles, the corridor of the tholos follows the circumference of the inner sanctuary on one side and is framed by high pillars on the other.  Dominating the sanctum's wall is a detailed mural, its edges painted in a nebulous effect that causes it to fade instead of having a clearly defined border.  Beyond the pillars, a rock garden stretches from the temple's steps to distant, conical-shaped thuja trees."
