    "description": [
      "The ancient heartwood of this mighty yew has long since passed into memory, replaced by a great hollow and surrounded by a gnarled ring of new trunks.  The greenery gives mute testament to its vitality, and the surrounding wood is sound, showing no sign of rot.  An earthy scent persists in the air despite a slight breeze, and silence reigns within the hollow.  Moonlight breaks through the branches above to illuminate an oblong riverstone.  A single branch stretches out from an inner trunk."
