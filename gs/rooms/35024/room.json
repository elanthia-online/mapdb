      "Warmth lingers over the roadway despite the efforts of the whistling wind.  Wafting gases from the north lend a faint, unpleasant odor to the surroundings, but stunted pines and several scraggly junipers heavy-laden with berries seem to thrive in the temperate span.  Smoke trails across the sky, belching from a lava-drenched mountain far in the distance."
