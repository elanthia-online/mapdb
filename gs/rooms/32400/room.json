      "The road begins a gently decline near a corner dominated by the remains of a tanner's hut.  Though the interior is ruined and choked with debris from the collapsing thatch of its roof, the smell of tanning agents and dyes is still acrid on the air.  A walrus skull, its eye sockets empty, stares from one of the intact windows, dispassionately watching the village's decay."
