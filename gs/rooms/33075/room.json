      "Elaborate systems of colorful sails and powerful weaponry line the outer edge of the flotilla's deck, making it hard to see the ocean from here.  The stern of an incongruous river boat has been permanently lashed to the flotilla, its once bright paint faded and chipped and its paddle wheel nailed solidly to the deck."
