      "A wooden representation of an oversized rolton steak swings gently in the night breeze beneath a shop's overhang on the south side of the Run.  The shop's windows and front door are open and a faint light filters out to the street.  Intent on their own business, only a few townsfolk are present on this section of the street, which looks like it sees more activity during the day.",
      "Chops, steaks and strings of sausage cover the plank tables set out in front of a shop on the Run's south side.  Sides of rolton hang in a row beneath the building's overhang, forming a backdrop to the butcher's tabled wares and obscuring the storefront itself.  A sharpener wheels her stone down the street, nodding to well-known customers and calling out prices to those that show an interest."
