      "Clean rosewood floorboards meet crisply painted walls, the pale green ivy design complementing the wood accents around the room.  Oil lanterns dot the wall at even intervals, illuminating the area with a soft golden glow.  Flanking the entry door on one side is a polished rosewood bin sitting between two benches, while on the other side, a wide oak table holds a variety of objects that glitter in the light.  Stretching deeper into the cottage is a long dimly lit hallway, and a gold-fringed woven tapestry hangs on the wall beside a narrow set of stairs."
