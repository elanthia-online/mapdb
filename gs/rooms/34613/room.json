      "Woven into the dark steel of the western gate are flocking ravens of black alloy, their shapes echoed in black paint on the tenebrous grey stones of the outer wall.  To the southeast are the high rooftops of various temples, while smoke and the acrid tang of hot metal swirls in from the forges of the northeast.  Nearby buildings are stained black from the wafting grit of the forges and stand like shadows along the roadway."
