      "Extending out over the bay, this substantial cedar deck is surrounded by a high railing and several benches, leaving a generous expanse of open deck, presumably for activities that require room.  A pair of catwalks provide access to the northwest and southwest corners of the South Market without having to pass through any of the shops whose backs line the east side of the deck.",
