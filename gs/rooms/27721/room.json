      "Immediately beneath the wall to the west is the narrow pathway known as Hope Alley.  Most of the customers move from shop to shop with their faces lit with good cheer, but some few move to the north with speed, purpose, and wary glances.  To the east, the landscape is split between night-black forests and moonlit snowfields."
