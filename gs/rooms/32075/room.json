      "Steam rises from a large pool in the center of the vaulted chamber, its crystal clear water sparkling beneath glass skylights overhead.  Long hardwood benches separated by potted palm plants are pushed up against glossy, marble-tiled walls.  Glass jars filled with various herbs, flowers, and oils line glass shelves behind an ebonwood table stacked with rolled white towels."
