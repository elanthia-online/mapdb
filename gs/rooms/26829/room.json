      "This dais sits at the end of the Hall of Sacrifice.  A large fountain has been built here which sits flush with the wall above a simple altar.  At the moment, the fount is quietly burbling while reflecting the bronze hues from the flickering candelabras stationed on either side of the fount and altar."
