      "Herbs in various stages of drying hang from the pavilion's wooden supports, and several decks of tarot cards and playing tiles are scattered amidst piles of velvet cushions.  A silk-draped table sits next to a particularly elaborate seating cushion, its colorful top covered with various sewing accoutrements and a cheery solstice snow globe.  A gold-framed sign is propped against the table."
