      "With one end supported by stacked crates and the other lashed to the taffrail, a salt-stained driftwood bar dominates the rear section of the deck.  Several three-legged wooden stools are arranged along the front of the bar, while a one-legged pirate stands behind it, ready to serve.  Lit torches are evenly spaced along the taffrail, between which can be seen the ocean waves on the starboard side and the busy flotilla on the port side.  A large coil of rope lays next to a companionway."
