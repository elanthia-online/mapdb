      "A trio of feminine mannequins stretches the length of one wall, while a trio of masculine mannequins occupies the other, the figures posed as if in casual respite.  At the rear of the cabin is an ivory linen partition, and situated in front of it is a small table topped with a round gold-stroked ivory pottery bowl and a gold-framed vellum sign."
