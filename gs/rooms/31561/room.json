    "description": [
      "Spilling into the courtyard from the inner ring, a well-trodden cobblestone pathway quickly becomes fractured and fragmented as it merges with circular pavers that grow further and further apart the closer they get to a scrollwork wrought iron gate.  Darkened windows gaze blankly upon the courtyard from shops and homes that face the inner ring, a moss-covered lancet stone archway offering passage between the two sections of the town.  A smattering of stone benches, some broken and cracked, rest in scattered clusters amid overgrown grass and copper-banded barrels."
