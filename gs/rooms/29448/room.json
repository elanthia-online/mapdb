      "The scent of green wood permeates the main room of this wagon.  Though sturdily crafted of excellent timber, its design is simple and rustic.  Two small windows adorn each side wall, their shutters shut tight against the cold.  A narrow table sits nearby displaying wares and two mannequins flank a small door leading to a back room."
