      "Pallets made of wood are arranged in an orderly fashion against an opposite wall, illuminated by the dim light coming in through a window that has been fogged over.  Barren walls and broken furniture show signs of wear and neglect, with several pieces in multiple stages of disrepair.  Several porcelain masks are strung from some luxurious black silk ribbon affixed to an oak beam erected into the ceiling, while a small stone stairwell leads down to a basement below."
