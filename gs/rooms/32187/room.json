      "Thick cobwebs with a cache of moths, flies, and beetles wrapped in their silky strands stretch across a tightly spiraled staircase.  At the foot of the stairs, a curtain has been pulled partway across a darkly stained mahogany panel, its edges illuminated with warm, glowing light from behind.  A spider dangles from a wax-covered candelabra set atop a high-wrought walnut newel post."
