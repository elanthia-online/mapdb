      "Hanging from a platinum chain, a pair of crystal lamps sway above, the faceted panes sending motes of fragmented light over the gold and green carpeting.  Set into the wall is a silver door adorned with the Sylvanfair coat-of-arms, opposite an ice blue snowflake lace curtain.  A mosaic crafted from sea glass hangs from the wall; light shimmers off of each piece as it illuminates the work of art."
