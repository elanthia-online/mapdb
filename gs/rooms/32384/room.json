      "Swirling muck and sucking goo covers the bottom of the sinkhole, fed by a constant trickle of frigid seawater and sandy mud from above.  A rope ladder dangles from the sinkhole's aperture, which occupies a good third of its crumbling ceiling.  Nearby, a silver stake lies mostly submerged in the water."
