      "Standing in the center of the highly polished checkered-marble floors, is a life-sized crystal replica of an antique forge.  This masterfully created structure serves as the counter in this distinguished armory.  An impressive display of well-maintained ancient suits of armor, encased in rectangular shaped frosted-glass cabinets, stands in the far corner.  Various scenes from days of yore are depicted on a black-velvet tapestry with raised silver stitching, which covers the back wall of the shop."
