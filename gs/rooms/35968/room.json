      "Shadow presses close where a narrow trail slips out of the forest and into the fire-lit clearing beyond.  The towering trunks of arboreal giants crowd together, their branches knitting a canopy that swallows most of the sky.  Through the gaps, faint streaks of an aurora-green sky glimmer before fading.  Thickets of sloe and fern press close to the path, their tangled growth creating a living wall.  The air hangs thick and damp, as if the forest holds its breath."
