      "The weathered remnants of a once prosperous gambling hall lie in ruin amidst this forsaken lot.  Stubborn weeds sprout pervasively from gaps in the distant crumbling stone wall.  Debris from the surrounding area has been amassed into a makeshift mountain of refuse.  A large faded sign hangs precariously from a single rusted chain before the gigantic heap, serving as either a welcome or a warning."
