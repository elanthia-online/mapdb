      "[The Great Piratical Flotilla]"
    ],
    "description": [
      "The main deck of the flotilla is expansive, its sturdy flooring intentionally scuffed to reduce falling accidents, and the outer edges are built up in a protective composite of ships, sails, metalwork, and weaponry.  A giant opening at the center of the flotilla drops into the ocean below, a rickety railing with a series of painted buoys serving as a very slight deterrent to taking a plunge."
