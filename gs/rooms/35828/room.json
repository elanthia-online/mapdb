      "Frosted globes hang like crystal teardrops from the ceiling, each casting a soft white glow that pools gently across the floor.  Hooks along the walls display corset vests in varied styles, their silhouettes outlined in pale light.  To the south, a double arch provides egress.  Heavy velvet drapes in deep shades of black and wine cover the windows of the eastern and western walls, while the backwall is dominated by an expansive oil-based painting."
