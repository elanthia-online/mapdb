      "Cozy and with a theme best described as pirate meets eccentric, the walls of the main living area are covered with a collection of maps and charts with a dart board positioned carefully between them and above a cupboard.  Several leather chairs arranged in a loose semi-circle around the fireplace rest on a rug woven to resemble a treasure map.  Sunlight streams through a large, bullseye window over a curtain-covered arch, brightening the area and bathing a spiral staircase in its warm rays."
