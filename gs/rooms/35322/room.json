      "Tall bookcases line the walls, filled with ancient tomes and scrolls bound in rich, deep green and brown leathers, meticulously organized and labeled in flowing elven script.  At the center, an imposing desk made from polished ebony wood sits, its surface clean except for a single ornate inkwell and quill.  Standing behind the desk is a silk-veiled tanned elven collector, his back to a lattice-framed mural depicting a serene elven garden."
