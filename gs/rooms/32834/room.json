      "Column after column continue in all directions of this vast chamber.  An illuminated area marking the center of the hall can be seen through the columns to the northeast.  Soft golden light radiates forth from torch-filled iron sconces mounted high on the marble-finished western wall to illuminate the intricate dwarven runes carved into each of the stone columns that fill the quiet gallery."
