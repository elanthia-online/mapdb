    "description": [
      "Emerald flames spit and hiss from a cavernous hearth that takes the form of a serpent with its maw open.  The snake's sickle-like fangs are black silhouettes against the inferno within, which heats the antechamber to an uncomfortable degree.  Scintillating green cinders drift on the air currents, pirouetting past banners and an aged tapestry portraying a man with a scaled face and a serpentine shadow.  A winding green stone staircase coils sinuously toward the upper story of the temple."
