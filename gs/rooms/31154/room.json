      "Cultivated by a delicate hand, a sea of hydrangea encircles the grassy lane on three sides and are sheltered by the high granite walls from direct sunlight.  The optimal combination of shadows, cool temperatures, and fertile soils causes the plump bushes to be packed with brightly colored flowerheads and emerald green, heart-shaped leaves.  Ranging in color from violet to fuchsia, periwinkle to blue, pink to coral, and white to green, the showy flowerheads are of both the mophead and lacecap variety."
