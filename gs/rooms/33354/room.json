      "A quartet of simple beds are set up along the walls of the sleeping area, each bed neatly made with green blankets and a single pillow.  A woven low-slung hammock hangs between a discolored wooden wardrobe and a large overhead beam.  Along the back of the room a pair of clothing racks frame an elaborate gold and brass mirror mounted on the wall.  A rusted iron rung ladder leads to a hatch in the roof."
