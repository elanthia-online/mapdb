      "Old droppings stain the stairs and coops of the rookery but have mostly been washed clean by rain and snow in the intervening years since the tower's abandonment.  They still lend a chalky white patina to the stone perches along the walls, which spiral up in a clockwise pattern toward the tower's ruined crown.  The collapsed ceiling leaves the zenith of the tower open to the moonlight and the forbidding shine of the stars.",
