      "The interior of this section of the hovel is spare, with all surfaces painted a dark, void black.  There were once windows, but they have been boarded over with black-painted driftwood that is further colored by the silhouette of a vivid silver marionette.  In the room's center, two stone sarcophagi sit side-by-side, each large enough to comfortably fit a small child.  Each sarcophagus is a different color and is draped with bright linens."
