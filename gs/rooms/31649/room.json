      "A myriad of yellowed wax candles encircle the steps to the ebonwood-framed bed, the extinguished tapers forming a pathway to the ceiling-high portrait draped in thin emerald chiffon, the fabric riddled with holes from contact with the open flames.  A flora-adorned mirror sits beside a tall dressing cabinet, the center cracked, leaving web-like fractures radiating toward the beveled edges.  A rusted steel dagger pierces through the black-lacquered door, its hilt wrapped in strips of desiccated flesh."
