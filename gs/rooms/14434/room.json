      "From this vantage point, the painted backdrop for the nave and the row of blue and green glaes clerestory windows are the most dramatic uses of color in the white limestone temple.  A border of leaping and frolicking silver dolphins chases along the walls, some extended out slightly and serving as sconces, disguising the many candles that illuminate the room.  The shell-shaped alabaster altar is quite ornate in comparison to the rest of the temple."
