      "Tendrils of pale white smoke snake through the dense jungle of plants occupying most of the available shop, leaving the faintest whisper of dark amber to resonate throughout.  A resin-stained workbench sits entangled in vines along the back wall, the top covered in dusty tomes alongside a worn marble mortar and pestle.  A faint hiss and rattle echo within the walls, its origin obscured by leaves and blossoms."
