      "The small, white-walled shop holds the sweet mixed aroma of cinnamon, flour, and honey.  A trio of aproned halfling maids move hurriedly about the room, restocking the shelves between taking orders.  Several patrons shuffle about the store, perusing the variety of frosted pastries and other delicacies a freckle-nosed halfling baker sets upon a counter."
