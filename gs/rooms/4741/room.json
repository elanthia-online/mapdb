      "A faint rasping sound drifts through the still woods, its origin unclear.  Although the utterance sounds vaguely like speech, its exact intent seems just beyond comprehension.  As the dry whispering becomes lost within the shadow-mired forest, a heavy silence once again blankets the area.  A web of woven netting has been hung across a crook in the branches of a nearby oak tree.",
