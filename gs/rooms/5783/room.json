      "Hunks of what smells like rotting meat hang from the high ceiling of this large chamber, each coated with so many luminescent flying insects that it acts as a gruesome natural lantern.  The sickly yellow light reveals a series of holes carved into the rock, some draped with coarsely cured hides.  A stained circular rock crouches at the center of the cavern."
