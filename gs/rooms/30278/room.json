    "description": [
      "The back of the galley is dominated by an enormous red brick oven, its center set with a long oily grate above a glowing fire.  A high shelf almost droops beneath the weight of bags of flour, iron pots and pans, and nearly a hundred corked bottles of rum.  A wide worktable is suspended from the ceiling by heavy ropes and its surface is scattered with various meat cleavers, jars of spices, and old stains.  Several crates and iron-banded barrels occupy every corner of the kitchen."
