      "Once vibrant tapestries, their images now soiled and lost to mildew, cover the rotted oak floorboards partially submerged into swampy muck.  A series of modular cubbies leans against one wall, with a skeletal tree of sharpened bones beside it.  Hanging from a patinated copper rod is a shredded velvet curtain leading to the back office."
