      "A smattering of bright purple loosestrife blooms beneath a magnificent canopy of darkened verdure.  Visible beyond the eastern shore, a ring of stone pillars, some leaning, others fallen, submit to the ravages of time.  A network of platforms and ladders have been built around the trunks of soaring trees, spiraling up and away out of sight."
