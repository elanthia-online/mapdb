      "Winding deep into the jungle, the path underfoot is well-trodden and clear of any typical jungle floor debris.  The air is filled with the raucous cacophony of birds, insects, and animals that dwell in the trees.  As the trail continues to the northwest, the foliage around you grows notably denser, though the path remains clear."
