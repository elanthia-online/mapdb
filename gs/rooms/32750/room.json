      "This double room contains a sitting area with two cozy easy chairs and a cushioned window seat as well as a spacious bedroom decorated in wintery hues.  A thick white carpet covers the floor, and white cotton curtains almost disappear against the pure white walls.  Four pillows patterned with silver snowflakes rest atop the elaborately embroidered comforter draped over the oversized bed.  An elegant crystal vase on each night table holds a small bouquet of white narcissus."
