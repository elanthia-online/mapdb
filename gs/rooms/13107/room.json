      "Iron lanterns illuminate the dim corridor from their positions between several windows with tightly closed shutters along the southern wall.  Steam trickles through the open door to the north accompanied by the scent of soap and sandalwood.",

Steam trickles through the open door to the north accompanied by the scent of soap and sandalwood."
