      "A canopy of starry sky arches over Gossamer Valley.  The few clouds brave enough to appear race across the sky from east to west, driven by the constant wind, only to be piled up against the western mountain face.  Forced upward, the clouds quickly drop their snow load and disappear, leaving the DragonSpine Mountains to the west heavy with snow while their counterparts to the east appear sparsely covered.",
