      "This bridge looks to be many years old, and the feet of uncounted travelers have worn a smooth path in the center of the stone bridge.  Small puddles gather in indentations in the bridge.  The splash of rushing water feeding steadily into the lagoon makes small waves that ripple to the beach."
