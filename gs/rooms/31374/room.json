      "Hanging lanterns illuminate disparate work areas in their flickering glow, and glint off of mica-flecked walls.  Easily half of the chamber is taken up by tool-strewn worktables and sturdy desks, a low bookcase sandwiched between them.  In one corner, inlaid mithril runes encircle a massive granite slab that rests where the shadows are deepest.  A peculiar copper clockwork dragon stands guard near the passageway, a lone sentinel watching over the half circle of chairs clustered at the workshop's heart."
