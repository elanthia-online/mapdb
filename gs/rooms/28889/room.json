      "Marram grass clings to the edges of the curving road, small tufts pushing up between the irregular-shaped cobblestones.  Brightly burning lanterns, their glaesine windows housing bright blue and green flames, are evenly spaced on both sides of the road, with a pair flanking the entry of a whitewashed inn.  A colorful sign spreads across the second floor of the structure between shuttered windows.",
