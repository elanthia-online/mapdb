      "The passage ends in a crumbling clay wall which extends into the uneven earthen floor and ceiling.  Pickaxe scars mark its accidental discovery, but care has been taken to clear and clean it since.  Several large shards of clay are piled nearby, and a large hole gapes from the wall.  The shards resemble pieces of a large jigsaw puzzle waiting to be completed."
