      "A polished round rosewood table with wrought iron legs stands as the focal point of this section of the gift shop.  Atop it are a silver jewelry tree and a chiseled granite bowl, the contents of which glitter in the torchlight.  To either side of the table stand a wooden chest of drawers and a darkly stained toy chest."
