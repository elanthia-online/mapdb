      "New planks mingle with older ones upon the pier, their addition creating a stripped pattern across the smooth platform as it juts a short distance out into the sea.  A series of oak steps leads to the main dock on one side of the pier, while on the opposite side is a small canvas-sided awning sheltering a bench.  Fishing boats are moored to the edge of the dock, their arrangement neat and tidy with an equidistant spacing between each."
