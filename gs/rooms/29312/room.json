      "Plain and spartan, the lofty tent is fashioned of yellow-striped, olive green wool and supported by thick ironwood poles.  Overlapping yierka hair rugs, each woven with hypnotic patterns, cover the western side where a simple sleeping pallet rests, while the east has fine, black sand surrounding a large copper-bowled brazier.  Opposite the entry flaps, a bejeweled oak chest offers a smattering of items for sale."
