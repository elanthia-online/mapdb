      "The aroma of exotic incense fills the room, mingling with verdant smells from outside.  Smoke from a still-burning censer curls in chaotic wisps, and several long strands of thread suspend rows of mushrooms to dry near the ceiling.  A number of odd plants potted in humanoid skulls sit on almost every available surface throughout the chamber."
