      "Arena flags and banners in a variety of hues and materials adorn the cabin walls, proudly advertising various venues and gladiators in boldly painted vignettes.  Several sets of wooden helm stands are stationed along the perimeter of the space, while a tiered wooden helm display is situated in the center and lavishly decorated for its place of honor.  A black-inked parchment sign is perched on the top of the display alongside a square enameled tray."
