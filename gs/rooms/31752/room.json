      "Dusty wooden cabinets line the walls of the shop, overfilled with aged scrolls wedged between leather-spined codexes and trinkets of various shapes and sizes.  A bent wire cage sits in the back corner partially concealed beneath a heavy amethyst wool cloak, the occasional sound of rattling muffled by the fabric.  A faint balefire green glow emanates from beneath the unevenly raised floorboards, leaving the lingering scent of sulfur as it fades."
