      "The stinging, sharp stink that is the unfailing accompaniment of the furrier's trade hangs like a pall over the road, resisting the efforts of the whipping wind to dispel the oppressive stench.  Several nearby shops have hides and furs stretched out on wooden racks to cure.  One tannery, larger and more prosperous than the rest, has a censer of strong incense suspended from a chain above its entrance."
