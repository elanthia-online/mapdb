      "A low ridge of igneous rock breaches out of the sands.  Crude steps have been cut out of it to ease the climb toward a trail that meanders northward on a hesitant approach to the looming stone cliffs overlooking the beach.  Snow and dried kelp are heaped around the base of the ridge, deposited by storm and sea."
