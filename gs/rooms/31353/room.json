      "Overhead, a skylight floods the entire room in clear, natural light, illuminating a large wooden table surrounded by a series of mismatched comfortable-looking chairs that runs the gamut of bright colors.  In one corner is a wide rhimar chest, and across the room from it is a large flagstone fireplace.  A low, wide sofa festooned with multicolored pillows is situated in front of the fireplace."
