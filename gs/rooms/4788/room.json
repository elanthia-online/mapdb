      "The sun glints off the steel grey surfaces of the exposed boulders, adding an extra bit of illumination to the area.  Some of the flat, exposed rocks are wide enough that branches from the flanking trees do not completely overshadow the rocks, and these spots absorb the sun's warmth, storing it to radiate back into the air later.  Some is reflected now, though, making the area much warmer than if it were heavily forested.",
