      "Any attempt at progress to the northeast is blocked by a large furrow, maybe fifty feet across, which runs in a general northwest/southeast direction.  Large amounts of dirt are piled up on either side of the furrow.  Although the sides of the furrow are crumbly and footing treacherous, it is possible to see that the furrow is quite deep, its bottom shrouded in darkness.  The trail moves off to the southwest in one direction, and veers to the southeast in the other."
