      "Mineral veins weave through the tunnel walls, reflecting the glow of crystalline clusters sprouting to either side of the path.  The otherworldly radiance plays across the uneven terrain, revealing deep gouges in the stone floor.  Near the mouth of the tunnel to the south, shimmering curtains of fungus attracted by the moisture and warmth lend their feeble light to the crystals' fitful scintillations."
