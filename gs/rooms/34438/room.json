      "Guarded by a low, copper pole railing, the platform perches upon the top of the wagon and has a panoramic view of the entire caravansary.  Large, water-resistant cushions are clustered along the western end, supported by a low wall of decorative white birch, while the eastern edge has a polished copper ladder leading to the yard below.  A small painted table shares space at the center of the rooftop with a wrought iron and brass telescope."
