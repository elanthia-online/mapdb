      "Thick green and brown vines cover large stone blocks mortared together to fashion three sides of the small chamber, while a fourth side, free of vegetation, descends into a dark tunnel leading west.  A narrow stone archway, the entry point for the innumerable vines, offers the only illumination into the room with sunlight cascading in and across a vine and leaf-strewn stone floor.  A rickety chair sits to one side of the small chamber next to a larger archway leading south into an adjacent room.",
