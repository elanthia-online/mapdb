      "Carved from deep blue stone that is slick with moisture, the walls of the antechamber are shaped to resemble the body of a coiled eel.   The stone creature's bulging eyes stare down from an arched passage to the north where its mouth ought to be, jagged teeth of stone pressing down from the curve of the arch.  Spirals of sea glass are inlaid into the marble floor, which is as dark as the ocean's depths and shot through with jagged silver veins."
