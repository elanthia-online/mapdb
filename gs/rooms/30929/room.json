      "The tavern is dominated by an expansive bar stretching in an arc around the circular chamber.  Stools are arranged in groups around the curve, upholstered in tawny-colored leather.  A couple of ceiling fans hang from above, empowered by a clever system of pulleys and cranks, and to one side, the walls open to a patio where a few tables stand beneath green umbrellas."
