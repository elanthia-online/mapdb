      "Obsidian stepping stones zig and zag along in a haphazard version of a path, some joined together by an even darker substance of unknown origins.  At the water's edge, a sun-bleached piece of driftwood rests next to shards of salt-stained, shattered obsidian.  A break in the copse of dark trees lining the inner atoll allows a view of the shimmering center point.",
