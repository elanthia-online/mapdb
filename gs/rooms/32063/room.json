      "Hungry flytraps bide their time, spread open to reveal their cerise mouths, while others have tightly clamped jaws as they digest a recent meal.  Damp and mossy, the trail passes through a menagerie of exotic plants with creeping tendrils, curvy shapes, and glaring colors.  The occasional butterwort with its pastel hues appears deceptively innocuous in comparison to its gaudy surroundings."
