      "The river flows languidly northward, lapping against the sheer walls of a ruddy granite canyon on both sides.  Atop the eastern canyon wall, the highroad parallels the path of the river before veering behind an outcropping of pearl grey boulders.  A gnarled root juts from the canyon wall, casting a jagged shadow across the moonlit waters."
