      "Lining the walls of this meeting room are charts of the local sea and maps of the surrounding land areas.  A large weather-tight door slides open to allow fresh air to clear out all of the hot air coming from the long-winded debates of captains, merchants, and townsfolk.  Several chairs are located around a large invar and silver-etched table, and the Mist Harbor emblem is prominently displayed on the south wall."
