      "The massive trunk of the tree supports this half of the treehouse, forming a solid wooden wall on the western side.  Strange chitters of small animals and the sounds of rustling leaves fill the air, adding to nature's ambience.  A light breeze ruffles the branches of the mighty oak, causing pockets of eerie moonlight to dance across the floor of the glade below."
