      "Standing imperiously atop a raised dais at the precise center of the disc, a monstrous throne of seaglass is framed by a pallid expanse of dead coral.  Lightning without thunder forks through the throne in blinding flashes and violently brilliant surges, finding muted echo in the radiance pulsing from the stone of the disc.  Below the scintillating throne, an altar is carved with a man of cruel countenance with a stormcloud in one hand and a cresting wave in the other."
