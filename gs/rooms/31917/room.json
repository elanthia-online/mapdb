      "A fine drift of snow freezes the flags underfoot, their stony faces rimed with frost.  High above, the glass panes of a silvery iron-framed dome are half broken and half missing.  Powder collects on the furniture below, including a table and desk, both of which are covered in heavy folds of concealing green velvet.  A glass globe, floating and lit up with a bluish light, hangs in the middle of the chamber.  A marble arch is set into one wall, and a gilded door into another."
