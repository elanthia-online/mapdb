      "The scent of fragrant flowers fills this sunlit room.  A huge four-poster bed carved with a pattern of roses faces the tall arched windows, providing a view of the gardens beyond.  An oil painting of Karess and Commandant rests above the fireplace, surrounded by white candles.  In the far corner of the room a miniature waterfall fills a golden heart-shaped pool.  A mirrored ivory dresser and a satin-covered stool stand against the wall."
