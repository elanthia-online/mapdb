      "The wall farthest from the door is completely open to the gentle breezes from outside.  Looking closely you see that the wall, made of what appear to be translucent leaves, is shuttered to the side allowing it to be closed in case of bad weather.  The furnishings include a large oak rolltop desk with books and papers scattered over it, and a cozy soft beige couch and antique chairs for company.  The floor is covered with a forest green rug made from puma hides edged with the finest gold thread."
