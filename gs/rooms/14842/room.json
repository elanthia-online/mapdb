      "Bright green grass suddenly gives way to a weathered cobblestone path that leads up to a polished silver gate.  A tall silver fence runs to both sides of the gate, a peaceful garden visible on the other side.  The metal is brightly polished and covered with creeping vines of ivy and dozens of small crimson flowers.  Moonlight sparkles beautifully off of the silver.",
