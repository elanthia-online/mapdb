      "Underbrush rises up into a dense wall to the north, forcing the path to cut a sharp corner.  The firewheel trees remain on the opposite side of the path with no hint of invading underbrush amongst their wide trunks.  A pair of squirrels dart amongst the firewheel tree branches, chittering madly as they chase each other around at breakneck speed before disappearing from sight."
