      "Paving stones the size of coffin lids and rounded with age lay broken along the wide causeway, their uneven surfaces forcing the movement of travelers into a slow and irregular dance.  A few of the stones bear wheel ruts a handspan deep, evidence of the caravans -- or perhaps the armies -- which once rode this way.  Gigantic oaks link branches over the road and cast the crumbling rocks beneath in melancholy half-light.",
