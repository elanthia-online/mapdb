      "The air is cooler here in the shade of the protruding rock overhead.  Sheltered from the elements, two fragile rock paintings, one small and one large, are still visible despite the harsh conditions.  A flat-topped boulder pushed up against the cliff would be a comfortable place to rest if the pile of small rodent bones next to it didn't remind you of the everpresent dangers of this region."
