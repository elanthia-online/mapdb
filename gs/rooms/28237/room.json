      "The chamber narrows significantly, cluttered by rows and rows of unopened crates, barrels, and chests, each one labeled as food, ale, or supplies.  A low wooden shelf juts out from a far wall, its surface packed with folded clothing items, from tabards, to gloves, to boots and hats.  A few wooden tables have been stacked up in a corner, along with a number of unused cots."
