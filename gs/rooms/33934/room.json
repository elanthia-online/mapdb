      "Glowing motes float in the air over the gently burbling surface of this crystal clear natural spring.  Mason-cut stone blocks have been arranged around the edges of the pool to provide places to enjoy the tranquility of the surroundings in the refreshing water.  While slightly cool at first, acclimation to the spa's embrace takes little time."
