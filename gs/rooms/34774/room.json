    "description": [
      "Hungry fires burn green in alcoves along the walls, making the air behind a stygian stone altar warp and shimmer with their infernal heat.  Their radiance dances off of the facets of viridian soulstone shards set into the black walls in an undulating pattern.  It bathes the curves of the altar, which is carved into the shape of a large, coiled snake.  The western wall yields to a huge circular window made up of crystal panes.  Cruel daylight streams through the glass, casting long, dark shadows through the chamber."
