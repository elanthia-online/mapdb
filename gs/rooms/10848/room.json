      "The narrow walkway, made from broken fragments of white and pink shells, follows the gently meandering contours of the wide river.  To the north are the delivery entries in the backs of various town shops.  Between the back entrances is a small shop door, from which emanates a powerful smell of pickle brine.  To the south, the wide Tempest River wends it way out toward Maelstrom Bay.",
