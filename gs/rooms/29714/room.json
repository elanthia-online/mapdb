      "Wood and paeline construct the framework of the room, the simplistic design centered upon a single lantern highlighting the carved stone recess against the far wall.  Overlapping leaves have been interwoven in raised threads across the cotton rugs,  the design echoed in the wood that surrounds the pale cerulean marble statue set within the niche, indiscernible from years and hands.  A small altar carved from riverstone sits below the statue, the incense set atop burning steadily as the smoke rises to the heavens.",
