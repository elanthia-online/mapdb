      "The upper hallway comes to an end near a pair of black walnut double doors, which are framed in an elaborate arch featuring inlaid chunks of holly, oak, and alder that from a gently undulating pattern.  Beeswax candles ensconced to either side illuminate the rich grain of the wood.  Before the entrance, an ancient Mhoragian rug depicts a cavalry charge."
