      "Relatively unprotected, this small pier juts out from the main body of the flotilla with the ocean sparkling in the moonlight all around.  Dozens of canvas coverings provide shade and protection from the elements, and several chairs and fishing poles rest beneath.  At the farthest edge of the pier stands a tall modwir flagpole proudly displaying the flotilla's colors."
