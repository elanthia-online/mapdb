      "Thick snowberry bushes run along this corner of Icemule's stone wall, enclosing its well-trodden path.  Some of the glossy white fruit has fallen to the ground and been trampled.  The choicest berries are continuously being harvested by bushy tailed squirrels that dart in and out of the foliage."
