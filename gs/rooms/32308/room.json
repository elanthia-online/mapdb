      "Near a fork in the road sits a broken mule cart, abandoned and askew.  One of its wheels is missing, but another is sunken into the earth.  The metal of it is spotted heavily with rust and has corroded through in places, as if it has been there for some time.  Mulefoot fungus has flourished in the shadow of the abandoned vehicle, fleshy, green, and shaped like a mule's hooves."
