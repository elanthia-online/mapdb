      "Bright candy-colored buildings dot the landscape of verdant green grass and flowers, each shop surrounded by topiaries of whimsical creatures clad in outlandish clothing and accessories, the animals posed in various forms of cartwheels.  The cobblestone road leading from the stained glass gate is covered in doodles scrawled in thick chalk, the rainbow of childish calligraphy stretching outwards towards other areas of the neighborhood."
