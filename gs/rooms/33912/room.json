      "Blankets of colorful maedatha are stacked in honeycomb-shaped shelves across from the fine-grained stalls, the recesses filled with worn toys and stiff-bristled brushes.  Steel buckets of water and oats hang from tall, leather-strapped posts; the containers sway gently with the ocean breeze flowing through the sash windows, the rustling threatening to topple a stack of apples set on the ledge.  Knotted lengths of hemp are affixed above the stalls, the ends suspending heartleaf-entangled glass spheres."
