      "A polished rosewood bar spans one side of the room, padded stools placed in front of it.  Behind the bar are shelves containing a large variety of drinks while hooks and racks above the bar hold an assortment of glasses.  A rich plum rug covers the floor, tall tables surrounded by stools scattered about it, and tattered flags hang from the walls.  A glass-paneled cabinet features a collection of bottles filled with colorful liquids."
