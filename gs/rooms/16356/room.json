    "description": [
      "Sparse and spacious, the cottage has three windows set into the center of each of its walls and though it has an entry there isn't a door.  Bamboo floorboards maintain a bright glossy sheen that easily reflects the filtered sunlight throughout the area and even reaches to the center of the room where a patterned prayer blanket rests.  Small shrines located in each of the room's four corners are lit by various candles, their flames sporadically spluttering."
