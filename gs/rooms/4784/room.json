      "The hillside to the northwest looks very much like a green pincushion.  Thick underbrush of competing young trees and holly bushes blankets the slope, providing a rolling sea of light and dark green foliage.  Through this carpet many blackened tree trunks protrude, giant burnt matchsticks thrust up toward the sky.  A few have bits of greenery still on them, sticking out at odd angles, but for the most part they are just charred reminders of a fire long since past.",
