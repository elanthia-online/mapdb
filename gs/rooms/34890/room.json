      "Little moonlight is able to filter through the ceiling-like cover overhead.  Striated fins form the underside of a shriveled mushroom above - like a wide and firmly planted umbrella.  The giant, varicolored fungi seem to have positioned themselves in a protective circle around a gnarled tree stump, where their deep, earthy essence settles over the garden's visitors like a dry, old, musty blanket."
