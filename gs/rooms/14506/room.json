      "White riverstones create a slender pathway through the tall grasses that lead both northeast and southeast towards various small structures, situated around a small pond.  Set at the heart of a small garden, a simple bench is arranged to face the quiet waters of the pond.  Glass lanterns arranged upon copper poles rest at various points along the path, though they are dormant now.",
