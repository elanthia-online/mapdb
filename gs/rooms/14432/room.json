      "Verdant green borders contrast with the white gravel of the path as it winds its way east and away from the main thoroughfare.  Fine mesh netting is bound to various tall oak poles, creating a safety screen between visitors and a dense green-black jungle that looms to the east.  Occasionally, the distinctive chattering and calls of primates echo through the air.",
      "A wide grassy field protected by a large enclosure sits to the west of the path, and a large piece of transparent glaes serves as a window to the world within the large habitat.  A subtle breeze blows through the enclosure, stirring the grasses and leaves on the trees that rise up from the ground.  An ebon-feathered cockatrice can be seen moving about the field.",
