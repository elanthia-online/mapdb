      "The top of the southwest tower of the inner keep appears to have been shattered by some unknown force, and fragments ranging from tiny pebbles to massive blocks of stone are strewn about this area.  You pick your way carefully through the rubble, avoiding the sharper bits.  To the south lies the southwest guardtower."
