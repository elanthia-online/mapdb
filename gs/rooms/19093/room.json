      "Walls of pale jade green stenciled with a glossy black floral pattern complement the varnished oak floor of this cozy room.  The scent of flowers and fresh earth permeates the air, and tables stacked with vases full of a variety of blooms take up most of the space in the area.  In the corner of the room a small, cluttered counter is home to a brass bell and a small gold-lettered sign."
