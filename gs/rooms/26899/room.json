      "Lacquered floors of deep red mahogany and ruic parquetry fan outward from the entry banisters, the rich colors highlighted by simpler woodland tapestries hanging on the walls.  Positioned for browsing, a line of rounded glass displays and an elongated carved monir shelf boast a variegated plethora of ornately styled wigs and canisters."
