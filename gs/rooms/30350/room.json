      "Exposed rafters line the roof of the cabin, the constant creak and roll of the ship causing various hangings to sway and the sound of creaking to slip through the balmy air.  Rolled and bound to a support post is an off-white and navy blue hammock, which leaves room for a trio of mannequins to be displayed between copper-ringed portholes.  Tidy shelves dominate the one solid wall and are filled with tidily folded pieces of fabric, bowls filled with pins, and baskets of cording."
