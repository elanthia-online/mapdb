      "Smooth sandstone walls rise from a weathered cobblestone floor.  Just above an elven bowman statue hangs a fused sun and moon wall-hanging, and a cerulean cloud-painted ceiling completes the picture.  An ora-bound large walnut trunk and a Vornavian silk-covered table stand side by side in the middle of the room."
