      "An unshuttered iron-caged lantern hangs from the ceiling by a short chain and sways above a pair of wood-framed cots.  A white metal cabinet is mounted on the wall, packed with an assortment of bandages, powders, colorful vials of liquids, and a large bottle of whiskey.  A wooden bucket in one corner is filled with soiled bandages, and a makeshift rack is nailed to the wall beside a door.  A peg-legged, ancient pirate serves as the crew's surgeon and main occupant of the infirmary."
