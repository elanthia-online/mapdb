      "At the base of the slope is a narrow field that has been cluttered by hundreds of bones.  Meat still clings to several rotted skeletons, but several large vultures strut among the remains, pecking and peeling as they go.  The odor of death and blood emanate throughout the area, only stirred about by the wind from the passage above."
