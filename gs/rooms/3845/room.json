      "Blue, green, and purple striped rugs are scattered about on the floor, like small islands, while an oak counter partially spans one side of the room.  A jeweler's loupe rests upon the counter at one end, and jewels in the process of being cut, cleaned, and polished sit at the other, in front of a padded stool.  Curtains matching the rugs hang upon the windows that adorn the walls, the curtains drawn back allowing daylight to enter.",
