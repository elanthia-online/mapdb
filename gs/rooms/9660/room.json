      "A clearing has been created with enough room for a multi-person loading operation.  A pulley system with a large platform attached is affixed to the mountainside.  Dwarves unload heavily laden wagons, placing the freight on the platform, or remove freight from the platform, placing it on the wagons.  The snow is rather slushy and dirty from the constant movement of the wagons and the tromping of heavy dwarven feet.",
      "A clearing has been created with enough room for a multi-person loading operation.  A pulley system with a large platform attached is affixed to the mountainside.  The pulley has been locked for the night, but several full wagons sit next to it with loads of lumber and foodstuffs awaiting the morning unloading.  The snow is rather slushy and dirty from the constant movement of the wagons and the tromping of heavy dwarven feet."
