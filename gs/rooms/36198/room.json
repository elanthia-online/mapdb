      "Mahogany-toned wool panels form the tent's enclosure, joined at reinforced seams and held taut by carved oak supports.  Each pole rises at regular intervals, etched with repeating knotwork patterns and shallow grooves along the grain.  A bronze lantern hangs from a crossbeam, its surface patterned with narrow ridges.  A large piece of leather lies in the center of the tent, piled with assorted goods that press against its worked grain and faint tooling marks."
