      "At the corridor bend, a breach in the stone ceiling far above permits a glimpse of the aurora high in the sky.  Its tangle of radiance bathes the section of catacomb in wavering ghost-light and illuminates the features of a ponderous granite statue guarding the walkway.  Snow-clad trees sway in the howling breeze, but the climb to them is an impossible stretch of stone worn smooth by centuries of snowmelt."
