      "A short wooden bridge arches over a burbling creek, joining the sections of the trail on either side.  Hostas and lush ferns grow along both sides of the bank, and various flowers in full bloom grow along the edge of this small clearing.  Brightly-colored butterflies and fat bees momentarily alight on the blossoms.  Swinging from an ironwork post is a glaesine lantern."
