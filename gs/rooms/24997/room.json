      "A ruined catapult sits crookedly in a makeshift trench dug out upon the left side of the road, the rusted bolts jutting out in random bent angles.  Just a few feet away from the contraption is an oversized granite boulder, the rock sitting upon the skeletal remains of an equally large beast."
