    "description": [
      "Huge crimson corpse flowers grow in stinking abundance, sheltering beneath a stand of hardy banana trees that have colonized a narrow stripe of fertile land at the center of a rocky ridge.  The flowers exude a pungent smell of rotting flesh so intense that neither the exotic perfume of jungle plants nor the gale coming in off the sea can fully disperse it.  Fat ants the color of carbuncles seem little deterred by the ghastly scent, for they swarm the ground beneath the huge blooms."
