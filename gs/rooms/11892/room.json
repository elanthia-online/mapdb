      "The sound of bubbling, flowing water is apparent in this chamber, but the source is not discernible in the darkness.  The walls on all sides are damp and cold to the touch, and the moving water is apparent around one's ankles and feet.  To the northeast the wall feels flat and smooth in comparison to the roughness and curvature of the other walls.  Perhaps at one time an opening existed but has now been sealed, yet the water has still found a way in.  One never knows for sure."
