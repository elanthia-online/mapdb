      "Shoreline stretches east and west in a continuous curve, the boardwalk running parallel to the water as it follows the worn track through fescue that clusters at the base of a southern hill.  Fishing racks rise at intervals along the path, their wooden frames strung with neatly hung lines and drying nets.  Nearby, simple smoking stations stand under open awnings, each fitted with low hearths and tiered grates where fillets rest in orderly rows above smoldering embers."
