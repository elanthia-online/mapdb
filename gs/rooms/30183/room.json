      "Hammocks fashioned from sailcloth and strung on lengths of braided rope sway from the low deckhead of this cramped cabin.  Likewise, the oaken table tops are strung from cables overhead, allowing sea chests and foot lockers to be stored underneath, as well as provide makeshift seating.  A tarnished silver mirror is fixed to the bulkhead above a small wash basin replete with shaving supplies."
