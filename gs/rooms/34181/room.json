      "Cinnabar crystal starbursts bloom like fiery flowers all along the grooved stone passage, though those that cower in the shadows of the uneven walls have fared better than the shattered remnants littering the central path.  Patches of silver-grey ore caught within the surrounding rock sparkle with metallic luster.  The tunnel ceiling rises to the southeast, peaking sharply as it opens into a natural chamber."
