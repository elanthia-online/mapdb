      "The back wall of the shop is carved directly from a massive vein of unblemished rose quartz, its tones ranging from a pale blush to a deeper salmon shade.  The rest of the room is cluttered with whitewashed hazelwood display cases and tables, each topped with myriad small baskets, bowls, and bins filled with coils of ribbon in polychromic hues."
