      "Burnished cherrywood floors span the length of the entire study, ending just before a dark mahogany hearth that is surrounded by a half-moon of mosaic gold inlay.  Ancient novels and tomes litter the built-in bookcases that nearly reach the ceiling, the extensive library only interrupted by the presence of a burled acacia doorway.  A rounded black marble platform rises at the back and is domed by vast glass windows that are set up for viewing with a wide-lensed antiqued copper telescope."
