      "Spacious and bright, the great room has been furnished with suede-covered seating tooled with a delicate red feather pattern.  Set inside a shallow recess along the northern wall is a garnet-inlaid door, while the west side has a glossy red door.  The golden bamboo floor has been inset with diamonds patterns wrought from redwood.  Suspended from the tall ceiling is an enormous wrought iron chandelier with red coral details, upon which numerous glass votives have been placed."
