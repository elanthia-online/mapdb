      "Small brass lanterns mounted in the walnut paneling cast a dim glow around this small office.  An ironwood desk with accompanying chair occupies one corner, and several straight-backed chairs cower against the wall in the opposite corner.  Interlocked strips of ivory and ironwood, polished to a high sheen, cover the floor from wall to wall and echo any footsteps.  Austere and serious are words that might be applied to this office."
