      "The ever-present cracks in the surrounding dome are much wider here, joined by a scattering of jagged holes and pinprick openings which admit faint moonlight.  On the whole, it looks as if what stands above is held up more by hope than any actual support.  Torches held aloft by stalagmites cast steady light on the racks of alembics and other equipment lining the walls, which are scarred and in places have melted like candle tallow.",
