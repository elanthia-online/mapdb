      "A tremendous four-poster bed with a lush teal comforter occupies the bedchamber, positioned beneath an illuminated crystalline dome etched with flurries of snowflakes.  Nearby, a frosted glass door opens onto a second-story patio that looks out over the rooftops and burrows of the town.  Silver threads glint from a tapestry of glacial blues and greens hanging on the opposing wall beside a lacquered hoarbeam door."
