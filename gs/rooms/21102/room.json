      "Books and scrolls lay scattered about this small stucco alcove.  A heavy oak desk rests near the far wall, jumbled papers and reports covering the desktop.  Near the entryway, an unstable bookshelf stands empty, leaning slightly on the uneven cobbles of the floor.  Sunlight filters through an open window, along with a mild breeze that carries the gentle sounds of the jungle.",
