      "Several coils of rope, thicker than an ogre's thigh, rest at the base of each ironwood support post on the oak and fel pier.  Numerous docking slips provide ample portage, their thick cork padding painted with ebon krakens wrapping myriad tentacles about them.  Strung from the driftwood and rope railings is a carved sign reading, \"North 'Haven Quay, Gold Pier - Slips 16-20.\""
