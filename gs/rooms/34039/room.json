      "Firelight from the west throws back the shadows, illuminating makeshift shelters erected from logs and stitched skins.  The crude dwellings are huge, but they are dwarfed by the scope of the cavern, the lichen-clad ceiling of which seems impossibly distant.  Great weapons, clubs and axes too large for most humanoids, lean against a near wall, crafted from steel, pine, and pitch.  Sacks of stout leather are heaped together and are brimming with dried provisions."
