      "A large dirt courtyard is enclosed by a stucco and timber building that wraps around the open space hugging the large, thick wall that guards the outpost.  A covered walkway serves as protection from the elements to those passing in between doorways and archways that open directly on to the courtyard.  A row of sun-bleached orc skulls arc over a large gateway set into the wall, gazing downward on those coming and going with frozen grins and dark, lifeless eye sockets."
