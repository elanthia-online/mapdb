      "Wood-framed maps, their once vibrant ink aged beneath the panes of glass, hang between paintings of local flora and wildlife that dot the stone-stacked walls of the stone cottage.  Two half-circles of worn leather couches enclose an intaglio-carved table in the center of the room, the seating opening up to a trophy-adorned fireplace rising to the ceiling.  Crystalline decanters and glasses rest upon a wheeled steel cart nestled in a back corner."
