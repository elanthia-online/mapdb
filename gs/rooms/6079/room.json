      "The fields of wheat stretch off in every direction.  Here and there boulders protrude up through the wheat, like whales breaching through the ocean of grain.  To the north, past the grain, a long line of birch treess presents a rustling grey curtain against the darkened sky.  The trees and the grain sway almost in unison with the passing of the soft breeze.",
      "The fields of wheat stretch off in every direction.  Here and there boulders protrude up through the wheat, like whales breaching through the ocean of grain.  To the north, past the golden grain, a long line of birch trees presents a rustling green curtain against the blue sky.  The trees and the grain sway almost in unison with the passing of the soft breeze.",
