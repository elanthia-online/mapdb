      "Every inch of the surroundings are incandescent with flames, with fire seeming to consume even those things that defy logic such as stone and the very ground itself.  In the cavernous chamber, horrific towers of stone and bone rise in the distance even as blades of granite split the ground to stab upward.  Gouts of flame flare from the floor nearly to the ceiling, consuming any wayward trees, and the hissing of ruptures can be heard igniting from all directions."
