    "description": [
      "The jungle canopy falls away near the end of a dark stone ridge, revealing a winding path down toward the island's western beach.  Gnarled roots and flowering vines cling to the steep slopes to either side of the trail.  Wind stirs the broad fronds of towering palms overhead, and the sound of the sapphire blue waves echoes off of the rocks, pealing over the descent like muted thunder."
