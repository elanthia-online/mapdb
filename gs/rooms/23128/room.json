      "Poorly lit lamps offer very little illumination at the entrance of the necropolis.  A recent cave-in has destroyed the stone bridge leading to deeper within, completely blocking it off.  A ruined black ora altar is tipped over by the egress toward the mausoleum.  The only hope of further progress is a stone ledge overlooking a chasm cloaked in darkness, which a splotchy goblin miner guards."
