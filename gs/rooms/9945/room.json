      "Patches of tall flowering weeds grow here and there above the level plain, attracting swarms of bees and a few brightly colored birds that add their chirping to the constant sound of wind across the grass.  The path winds around to the southwest, where the grassland borders a heavily wooded area.",
      "Patches of tall flowering weeds grow here and there above the level plain, their leaves fading to silvery grey in the wan moonlight.  A few crickets add their chirping to the incessant shush of night breezes through the grass.  The path winds around to the southwest, where the grassland borders a heavily wooded area."
