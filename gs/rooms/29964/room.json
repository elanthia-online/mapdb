      "The slabs of ruddy, iron-laden stone that comprise the floor slowly rise as the corridor bends to the northeast.  To either side of the walkway, alcoves that are many times a man's height are recessed into the walls, their edges rough and obviously the work of primitive architects.  They are denuded of whatever treasures they once held, but pottery shards and bits of broken bone swept to the corridor's borders hint at vases and ancient art."
