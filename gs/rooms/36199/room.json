      "Canvas walls stand in broad, even panels, their seams bound with sturdy cord.  Tall candles line the entrance on holders formed from wooden disks carved with repeating geometric cuts.  A wooden rack occupies the back section, its frame shaped from bent branches lashed together.  A thick woven carpet spans the floor, its surface marked with dense patterns and raised threads.  At the far end, a curved support shapes an archway covered with a drape of horn slivers and narrow clay cylinders."
