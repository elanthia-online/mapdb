      "On the far end of a blood-filled sinkhole, the rough-hewn wall is spattered with mad sprays of dried blood that form monstrous sigils and sinuous tangles.  The uneven earth is a wash of carnage that has gone crusty and black at the edges.  Radiating cracks streaking from the depression's edge suggest that the sinkhole is still growing, albeit slowly."
