      "The trees are interrupted by a swath of tumbled boulders, lying in the snow like sleeping mammoths, their backs furred and fringed with lichens.  A few more of the small, hardy bushes flaunt their colorful reds and oranges among the more somber arrays of the lichens.  The trail winds through the rocks and climbs through the pines to the east."
