      "Sheltered by the icy overhang of the forecastle decking, an oak and glass door lays mostly in shadows as elliptical patterns of snow and sea salt dance across the deck.  Ropes stretch from the main mast, which is encircled by a bronze ring, towards the distant railings where pulleys assist in the manipulation of the behemoth.  Just a few steps towards the bow, an oilcloth-covered companionway of inky black rises from the flooring."
