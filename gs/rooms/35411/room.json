      "Sunlight dances across an array of delicate wares, each piece of blown glass shimmering in dazzling hues.  Shelves on a dark-stained wooden display house vases with swirling colors, intricate figurines, and strands of luminous beads that glisten like captured starlight.  A silk-draped table holds smaller trinkets in the form of miniature animals, delicate perfume bottles, and marbled paperweights."
