    "description": [
      "The vertical outstretched roots of a fallen oak, standing taller than an average human, extend outward from a half-buried trunk lying across the path.  Like the twisted tentacles of a creature from the unfathomed depths, the star-shaped root pattern almost appears to move in the shadowy half-light of the forest.  The fallen trunk, cluttered with dead leaves and splotched with mud, has been infected with termites, its once noble wood slowly being devoured and turned to dust.",
