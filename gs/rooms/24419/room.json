    "description": [
      "The natural spring has been roughly outfitted as a bath.  Flat stones upon which brilliant green lizards sun themselves ring the pool, the jewel-bright creatures eyeing you expectantly as if waiting for you to follow their example.  Sweetflags and rushes line the banks of the shallow runoff stream, following it west into impenetrable foliage.  The water is clear and the sandy bottom of the pool is a dazzling white in the sunlight."
