      "Spartan at best, the second story fills the entirety of the residence's floor space and is built between the eves of the roof.  Tiny glass jars filled with fireflies illuminate the space and hang in profusion from the exposed rafters.  Pressed against the north and west wall, a thick blanket-laden sleeping pallet has a battered old oak footlocker at one end of it, while a mirror-topped antique wash stand rests next to a descending spiral staircase."
