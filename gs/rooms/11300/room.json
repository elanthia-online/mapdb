      "Two contoured sandstone chairs rest in this chamber, although one has been half-buried by the wreckage of the eastern wall.  Moonlight-silvered leaves spotted with the fanciful shapes of orchids can be seen through a wide zigzagging crack in the wall, making the striped sandstone look dingy by contrast.  Crumpled papers litter the ground.",
