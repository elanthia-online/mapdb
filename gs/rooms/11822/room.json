      "Creeping vines and a thick growth of low-lying grass extends across a large space of ground that was probably once a huge open market where the inhabitants of the city could hawk their assorted produce and wares.  A series of bulky dark hillocks extend beyond the plaza, skulking like rats in the shadow of the massive city wall.",
      "Creeping vines and a thick growth of low-lying grass extends across a large space of ground that was probably once a huge open market where the inhabitants of the city could hawk their assorted produce and wares.  The exterior wall of the city cuts diagonally across the plaza to the northwest, rising past squared off hillocks of verdant green."
