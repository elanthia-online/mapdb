      "Bobbing, salt-stained planks congregate aimlessly about the derelict remnants of an aftercastle bobbing on the tide.  Scattered crates and a few empty barrels float lazily around, surprisingly intact but spattered with copious gull droppings.  A torn sail sprawls across the surface nearby, its fabric long since bleached to the color of aging bone."
