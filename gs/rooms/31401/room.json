      "A partially concealed trail leads through a cluster of wide trees, ending at the edge of a small outcropping.  Below the ledge, a narrow stream can be seen winding through the forest, its waters a deep silver-blue.  A few faint footprints can be seen leading right up to the edge, then seem to disappear over the side."
