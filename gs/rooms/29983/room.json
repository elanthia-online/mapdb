      "Tangled in a blanket of gnarled roots that have breached through the near wall, a breached crypt stands atop a raised dais of ruddy stone that is marked with the flaking remnants of a golden sunburst.  Undermined by the root structure of the vast and ancient trees aboveground, the wall has begun to buckle, flooding the ground with cold earth and stone."
