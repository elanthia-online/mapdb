      "Tall mahogany bookshelves cover the wall of the library, leaving only space for the mahogany archway.  Resting in the center of the room is a green felt-covered table surrounded by a number of cushioned chairs.  Hanging from the ceiling is a chandelier with bejeweled dice strung from the branched arms.  Overlooking the deck, some elevated glass panes allow for sunlight to cascade into the library, which rests just above a vivid lapis lazuli globe.",
