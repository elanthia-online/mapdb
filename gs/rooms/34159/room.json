      "The sickly sweet stench of decay rises from the sloughing corpse of an immense worm, which is draped over a ledge that overlooks a dark sea of stalagmites.  Fungi and mushrooms have raced to consume the fallen monstrosity and grow in profusion across the folds of its rotting flesh.  The rock of the cavern floor is cracked around the corpse, evidently shattered during the beast's death throes."
