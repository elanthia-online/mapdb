    "description": [
      "Wedged between a small copper-sided chest and a water-filled oak barrel, a rough painted oak sign provides information for the game that can played beneath this section of the awning-covered field.  Various water cannons, some broken and others displaying signs of recent repair, are scattered about the moss-covered ground, though a few in working condition rest against the base of the barrel and appear ready for use.  Splitting her attention between cannon and patrons, a mop-haired freckled girl collects coins and tinkers with jovial abandon."
