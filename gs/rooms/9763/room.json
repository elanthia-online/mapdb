      "Overhead, the arterial fingers of the great tree trace intricate patterns within the sheer substance making up the roof of the Observatory.  At the bubble's center sits a construction, a machine of some sort.  It has gears and gadgets and arms and globes reaching up in all directions.  Around it hangs a catwalk, which circles the globe-like interior of the chamber on impossibly thin, wire supports."
