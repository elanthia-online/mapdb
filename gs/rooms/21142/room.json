      "Bedecked in fine woven tapestries, the maroon silk-paneled walls surrounding this expansive room stretch upward to a domed ceiling.  To either side of the entrance, two small marble podiums stand opposite each other, each covered with a woven silk cloth.  Sweeping up toward the second level is a grand black-veined grey marble staircase, its railing carved with exotic flowers.  Set into an arched recess in the back wall, a set of double doors leads deeper into the theater."
