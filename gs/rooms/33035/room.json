      "High stone walls, covered in dark green ivy, surround a cobbled courtyard and conceal it from the forest without.  Two benches sit on either side of a gated entrance, granting a view across a well-tended garden to the west and an orchard beyond.  The air is filled with birdsong and rich with the smells of earth and leaf.  The entire northeast corner is occupied by an oak-gabled grey stone manse with an imposing door that is flanked on either side by twisted lilac trees, creating a fragrant archway.",
