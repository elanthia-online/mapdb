      "Rope-coiled rungs driven into the port and starboard sides near their convergence form a ladder of sorts, allowing quick travel to the upper decks.  Large coils of hemp rope are stacked on a row of barrels, and a broom lies on the floor by an overturned bucket.  Yards of discolored canvas lean between a thick metal hatch and a brass-handled door."
