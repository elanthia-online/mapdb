      "A quiet chamber is separated from the rest of the library by a fireleaf arch carved to resemble leaping flames.  At the zenith of the woodwork is a slit-pupiled eye.  Glass cases framed in veil iron dot the perimeter of the richly appointed recess, each containing a book on a bed of dusky golden velvet.  One pale book is bound in kroderine chains, while a black tome nearby has wards drawn in chalk beneath it."
