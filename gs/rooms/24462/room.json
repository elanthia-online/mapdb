      "Rusted iron hooks are set into the deckbeams overhead to support stained canvas hammocks.  Open hammocks trailing tattered blankets fill the portside bulkhead, effectively blocking the three brass portholes that are bolted closed.  Rat-infested heaps of filthy cloth occupy two of the room's corners and contribute to the foul odor filling the large space."
