      "Darkness cloaks the run, hindering a clear view of the surrounding woods.  Above, stout oak branches blot out most of the moonlight, allowing only a few slivers of light to penetrate the near perpetual darkness.  From somewhere in the shadows, something rustles the branches of a small shrub, its exact nature and location obscured by the low light.",
