    "description": [
      "Spared bleaching by the lack of sunlight in the sky, the bucket is brittle and dry, but still holds the color of new-cut pine.  It is sealed here and there with pitch.  Below, the well delves into inky darkness, the sole apparent denizen of which is the sluggish splash of water a long way down.  A thickly woven rope securing the bucket to the windlass provides means to climb out of the well."
