      "Copper-banded oak barrels, each branded with a black kraken, line the walls of this small holding area lit by wrought iron lanterns.  The warped oaken planks underfoot are gritty with sea salt and littered with bits of tattered canvas and frayed rope.  Lined up on wooden shelves, metal footlockers safeguard untold treasures."
