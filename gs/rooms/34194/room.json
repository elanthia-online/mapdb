    "description": [
      "A sluggish stream of mingled dirty water and fetid, yellowish slime flows from the northeast incline and follows along the tunnel floor as it sinks downward toward a stone chute, inevitably sliding over its lip.  Thick, matted strands of ruddy silk splay across the ceiling above, clinging to the grooved stone, with more of the rubbery excretions drooping down into the chute's slick depths.  Streaks of chalky crust line the passage winding south, bracketing a thin trench lined with old, brown stains."
