      "Thinning and yellowing as it becomes sparser, knee-high ryegrass surrounds the simple track that follows the curving incline.  Tall cairns, sun-bleached and covered in moss, dot the landscape in small, flattened clearings within the high grass, each marking where smaller trails descend from the barrow and lead to small homes clustered on the western incline.  Supported by angular rocks and wedged deeply into the ground, a spindled branch is imbedded into the track, its thin limbs covered in hemp-strung talismans."
