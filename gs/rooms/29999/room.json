      "Splintered barrels mark the entrance to a battered turf house that must have been a cooper's shop.  Embergrass grows thick on the snowy rooftop, which has collapsed inward in places, leaving the dwelling's front door impassable.  Several unfinished staves lean next to the entrance as if waiting to be worked."
