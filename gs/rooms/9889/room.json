      "Next to the path, a filigree of lichens cover the shoulders of a grouping of three boulders huddled like ancient old trolls squatting over a game of knucklebones.  Birds chatter and dart through the linden boughs overhead, the leafy half-light of the thick canopy offering them almost constant concealment.  The grove wears its scent of rich, moist earth and leafy compost like a rare perfume, alternately strong and subtle depending on the whim of the breeze.",
      "Next to the path, a filigree of lichens cover the shoulders of a grouping of three boulders huddled like ancient old trolls squatting over a game of knucklebones.  A nightingale, hidden within the linden boughs overhead, periodically sings its call to the moonlight.  The grove wears its scent of rich, moist earth and leafy compost like a rare perfume, alternately strong and subtle depending on the whim of the breeze."
