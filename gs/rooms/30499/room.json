      "Fresh air and sunlight filters through the overhead trellis, mingling with the prevailing scents of coffee, old leather, and rosemary in this intimate patio space.  Three small, oval tables are located in a loose semi-circle, each surrounded by several low-backed armchairs.  One of the seats is occupied by the Retired Airship Officer Tedrik, who, despite the alert expression in his eyes, appears to be in the firm grip of relaxation as he nurses a cup of coffee."
