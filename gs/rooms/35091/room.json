      "The stygian crenellations of the Ashka Krol strain up over the rooftops of buildings to the northwest, as if the fortress's uppermost reaches were clawing at the bitter sky.  Carts laden with nets full of glistening fish creak and clatter over the cobblestones, heading north to restaurants and well-to-do fishmongers' shops.  The day's catch seasons the air with a smell of saltwater and the telltale odor of fish guts."
