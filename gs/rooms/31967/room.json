      "Though subterranean, the chamber has been decorated to conceal that fact, with two walls lined with floor-to-ceiling witchwood bookcases, while the others are covered with a deep forest green wallpaper lined with thin stripes of metallic bronze.  Sconces are mounted meticulously at regular intervals between the lines, set with ivory candles that glow with viridian-sparked golden flames.  A narrow glass-shelved rack, with a witchwood humidor on the top shelf, stands beside a set of steep stairs leading downward."
