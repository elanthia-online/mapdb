      "Music breezes lightly through the air, soft as a memory, insulated from escape by the dense tree cover overhead.  Leaves of wine red-violet are offset by intruding limbs draped in golden yellow that warm to ember-bright orange, and the scent of maple sap is high in the cool, lantern-lit air."
