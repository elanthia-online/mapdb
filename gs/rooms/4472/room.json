      "This circular cavern appears to be much smaller than it actually is, probably because almost every possible inch of floorspace is covered with assorted tools, scraps of metal, and half-finished helms.  A large invar anvil stands in one corner, and an unlit forge is set into the wall behind it.  A weathered oak barrel stands in one corner with a large sign attached to the front."
