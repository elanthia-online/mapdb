      "Crowded around a muddy path, thin and tall trees rise up through of layers of ferns and into the overhead cover of thick vines and greenery.  Stray beams of sunlight permeate the cover, allowing filtered light to soak the jungle growth with life.  Laden with humidity, the air is alive with the sounds of insects, birds, and the occasional clicking of voices coming from beyond the nearby open-faced hut.",
