      "Bright white mistletoe berries peek out from atop the tall hedges they have invaded.  Twisting ivy vines curl between the exposed roots, the foliage dusted with tiny clumps of moist soil from recent tending.  Large, broken seashells, firmly imbedded into the smooth dirt path, crunch underfoot as you pass through."
