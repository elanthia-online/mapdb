      "Pumpkin orange and sickly green light bathes the musty space in a lurid glow.  Stuffed with grotesque specimens, illumed preservative jars line the mildewed shelves spanning the back wall.  Water stagnates in the deep lines of a summoning circle gouged into the limestone floor before a swollen mangrove altar.  Fractured under the weight of the low, faulty ceiling, an ogee arch frames a dark opening, wispy cobwebs clinging to the corners."
