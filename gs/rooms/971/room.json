      "Narrow streams of melting snow trickle down the hillside, coalescing into small pools around the rough trail.  A high cliff face rises from the rocky earth, its countenance impeding further progress into the valley below.  Near the center of the massive wall of rock, a jagged fissure scars the stony surface, revealing a narrow passage.",
