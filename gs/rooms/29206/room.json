      "Some sections of this narrow passage twist so sharply, one must turn sideways to manuever through.  The smooth rock floor below, though sturdy, is tilted on a diagonal.  Handholds for security have been chiseled into the pale white walls, spaced evenly apart to aid in safe passage from one end to the other.  Stalactites glossed over with underground seepage hang precariously downward from the high, narrow ceiling."
