      "Pale blue walls surround this small alcove off the central nexus to the southeast.  The focal point of the space is a swirling sunny yellow portal framed by an oval of wrought silver.  River reeds and water lilies have been etched into the metal, their shapes intertwined to form a complex pattern.  A warm breeze swirls around the area, scented of the flora of River's Rest and the fresh fragrance of rain."
