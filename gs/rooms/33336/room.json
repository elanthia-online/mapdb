    "description": [
      "A precarious ledge juts out from the middle of the rock wall, lending access to deep niches carved out of the stone.  Winks of gold and other metallic hues flash from the darkness of several of the holds.  A single such recess might be the work of nature, but the even procession of them suggests that they must be the work of skilled beings.  Above, the rock wall is smoother and lends little purchase for climbing.  In some places it appears smooth as blown glass."
