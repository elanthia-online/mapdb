      "Deep green marble flooring is interrupted only by a lone black granite diamond pattern in the chamber's center.  Tall cases of books fill almost every inch of wall space along three walls.  The fourth is hung with a massive tapestry depicting the great hunt, detailing the scene of a long-ago king and his retinue triumphant over a vanquished foe."
