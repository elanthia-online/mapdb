      "A bright blue carpet fringed with silver tassels leads up to the entrance of a gaming hall, proceeding between two yew trees that have been trimmed into the shapes of mules and sprinkled with silvery powder.  A stout halfling in silver and blue livery bows low as would-be gamblers pass through the doors, an inviting smile on his lips.  An occasional shout of excitement erupts from within the hall as someone wins another hand.",
      "On either side of a carpeted entry are two dark yew trees, trimmed into the shapes of mules and sprinkled with silvery powder.  A young halfling in silver and blue livery bows low as you pass by, gesturing toward the doorway with an inviting smile on his lips.  From inside the gaming hall comes a rising cry, as someone wins another hand."
