      "Roughly hewn, unfinished timbers support a ceiling and chiseled walls that still bear the marks of the miner's pick.  The only attempts at finishing seem to have been limited to the floor.  Though it is fairly level and smooth, a thick carpet of dust and mining debris makes footing hazardous.  A lone amber toadstool in a stone pot lights the passageway, and a pair of steel rails follow the east wall, disappearing through closed doors at the north end of the tunnel."
