      "A squared basalt arch marks the entrance to the yard of a small temple of shadowy stone.  Planters of neatly tended foxglove, nightshade, and deathwort are crafted from planks of dark wood, their careful cultivation suggesting the work of a precise and skilled gardener.  Before the entrance, pale flagstones form a cracked skull symbol that stands out amid the pale green grasses."
