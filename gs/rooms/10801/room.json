      "[Great Oak, Cracked Landing]"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Shaped from the once-living wood of the tree, the landing extends outward from an arch-shaped opening in the side of a great oak.  The bark of the tree itself has turned a sickly grey hue, and numerous thin cracks mar its surface.  Once sturdy branches have begun to lose their strength, bending low toward the ground some forty feet below."
