      "Crystalline chunks the size of boulders lie piled in a recess along the tunnel, reflecting the strange ochre light of smaller clusters glowing from the walls and ceiling.  Many of the chunks are shot through with cracks or boast craggy edges that suggest they were broken free with great force rather than proper tools.  The rocky ground has been deeply gouged with furrows leading to the west."
