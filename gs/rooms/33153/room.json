      "To one side, a cluttered array of potted plants frames an overstuffed blue sofa, and the variety of their northern blossoms lends a garden-like air to the cozy chamber.  The warm white of the textured walls complements the lustrous red-brown of the polished mahogany flooring.  Opposite the sofa, a large tapestry featuring a polar bear paw print screens the entrance to the locker booth beyond."
