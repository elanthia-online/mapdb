      "Winged, golden, and glittering, a sinuous golden dragon spreads its wings across the high domed ceiling.  A high gallery looks down upon the circular dais at the room's center, which is accessible via vast steps of white marble shot through with veins of gold.  Atop the dais, an immense chest of bloodwood and golden vultite is carved with the silhouette of a wyrm flying against a rippling aurora."
