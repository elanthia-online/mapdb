      "A faint breeze blowing up from the river adds a hint of moisture to the air, but the craggy rocks and sparse trees on the ledge are dry.  Several small lizards cling to the rock wall of the canyon, their faded brown color almost blending into the reddish stone.  A steep trail winds up the canyon wall."
