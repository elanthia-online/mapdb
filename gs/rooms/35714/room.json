      "Crude perches strung together from harvested branches, hides, and unevenly woven thatch perch precariously atop rocky outcroppings.  They are slapped together haphazardly, gaps patched with clumsy splotches of dried mud and clay that are only vaguely distinguishable from the droppings covering the wood like spent candle wax.  Wind shakes the uneven structures, causing hanging bone charms and feather decorations to sway like drunken sailors on a pitching deck."
