    "description": [
      "Incongruously, the eastern section of the garden is dappled in a thin layer of snow that allows blossoms to grow despite the subtropical climate.  Creating the illusion of a forest glade, pale yellow mosses reside beneath towering silver fir trees that elegantly hide the militaristic nature of the castle walls, while geometric hedges descend along the southern slope.  A narrow set of stairs ascends to the protective walls, while a small banded door leads into the keep and keeps company with a row of narrow whorled-glass windows."
