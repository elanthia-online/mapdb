      "This large circular room is filled with a stone conference table carved from the granite of the floor.  Heavy iron sconces are mounted to the marble walls, casting a soft gold light across a map of Elanthia that has been intricately carved into the table's surface.  Twenty-four padded chairs surround the engraved slab, behind which are some recessed shelves displaying expertly carved likenesses of famous dwarves past.  A pointed arch opening to the south leads back to the hall."
