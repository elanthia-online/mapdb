      "Sunlight filters through upturned, twisting branches of ancient, moss-covered trees casting a diffused glow over the lush verdure of the glade.  Fragrant wildflowers mixed with a comforting earthy redolence permeates the air, while a waterfall sounds in the distance, the tinkling melody of rushing water adding to the tranquility.  A pathway of smooth stepping stones leads to a secluded woodland sanctuary constructed of airy canopies and sturdy platforms."
