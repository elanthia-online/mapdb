      "Devoid of glass, a nearby window allows the elements to spill into the room causing deep black mold to spring to life upon the squared rocks of the walls that surround it.  Here and there, painted fragments outlined in flattened pewter wire rise out of the dull carpeting, their murky depths difficult to discern.  Though tarnished, a glass and brass display case appears largely undamaged where it rests at the entry to the niche."
