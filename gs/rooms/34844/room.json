      "Overgrown maple trees obscure the periphery of the grounds, their long finger-like branches bleeding purplish red leaves across the rust red-stained cobblestones set along the uneven path.  An imposing outline of the mansion casts sinuous shadows across the patches of dried grass, the clumps of detritus encircling the small mounds of dirt scattered across the lawn.  Thorn-riddled vines consume the iron-framed garden beds scattered through the area, the metal frames bent into contorted shapes."
