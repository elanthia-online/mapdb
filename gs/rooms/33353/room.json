      "The room is dominated by a huge dark ironwood table which rests atop a massive bedraggled woven rug, surrounded by a set of high-backed brown leather chairs.  Haphazardly nestled beneath the table is an enruned black mithril lockbox, neatly polished and well maintained.  Maps of Vornavis, the freeport of Solhaven and its bay, and numerous other local landmarks are hung on every wall of the room.  At the back of the room stands a glass-topped modwir display case."
