      "Standing out from the main trail, columns of grey-blue marble streaked with pyrite and serpentine support a pale haon cross-beam roof.  Spiraled cypress trees stand tall, extending out like wings from two sides of the arbor.  Nearby, the soft sound of Leaping Falls serves as a backdrop to the view of the starlit sky extending out above.",

Spiraled cypress trees stand tall, extending out like wings from two sides of the arbor.  Nearby, the soft sound of Leaping Falls serves as a backdrop to the view of the open meadow extending out in front.  Soaring hawks dive and turn, riding the thermals rising up at the canyon walls."
