      "A line of archery targets stands near to the castle walls, the painted bullseyes pocked with holes from past successes.  Lying abandoned in the high grasses, a bow with a broken bowstring sits as a remnant of a time before the yard fell into disuse.  Its wood is silvered and splintered from exposure and neglect."
