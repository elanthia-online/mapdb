      "Stuffed opponents are driven onto stakes in the training yard.  Mildew spots the burlap figures, and the hay stuffing them has grown damp and fetid, lending them an ugly lumpiness.  A veranda extends out from the castle walls, lending cover to racks of weapons, armor, and shields, but from the deteriorating state of the arms, the effort to keep the elements at bay appears to have been in vain."
