      "Overlapping square rugs of durable, if utilitarian, wool cover most of the wooden floor, while ensconced torches dominate the walls and stain the ceiling with soot.  Thick iron hooks, sturdy wooden pegs, and heavy wrought iron racks rest beneath the light sources, each laden with armor and armaments.  Descending to the floor below, a copper and oak ladder disappears through a small hatch along the western wall."
