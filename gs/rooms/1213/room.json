      "The path curves sharply as it snakes through the trees.  Some of the area's firs sport needles with black tips, providing a stark contrast to the usual greenery.  Resting between two of the trees you see a large boulder covered with mud as if it had been recently moved.  A particularly low copse of trees juts out across the path at your ankles.",
