      "Created by bracing the large rib bones of some gigantic creature against the rickety walls of the hut, this secluded niche is cramped and tiny.  Shoved into one corner is an articulated dolphin skeleton, its bony body covered in draped pieces of clothing, while a squat bone armoire is crammed directly across from it.  Bones litter the floor in various places, some small and some large, while a few scattered candles in skull lanterns provide scant lighting."
