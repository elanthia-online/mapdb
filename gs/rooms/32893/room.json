      "Surrounded by homes on its left and right, a small shrine rests within a stone garden decorated with gopher plants and succulents.  Nearby homes have small pathways leading from their awning-covered porches to the cobblestone road, while warehouses decorated with bright white stucco show their windowless and doorless backs to the domestic setting.  Pin-tailed sandgrouse amble between the homes, their plumage quiescent as they wander."
