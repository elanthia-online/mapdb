      "Cobweb-curtained niches honeycomb the eastern and western walls of this sepulchre, their only occupants spindly, wax-mantled candelabras that illumine the tomb with a warm glow hardly befitting the surroundings.  An imposing limestone sarcophagus rests beside an ithaenil-set runed mistwood cabinet, partially obscuring a series of damaged frescoes.  A very important RULES sign sits just inside the entrance to a darkened passageway."
