    "description": [
      "A small hut hangs precariously amid the branches of an ancient manna gum tree, its walls woven from branches and strips of dried sinew and sealed with dried sap.  The air around it is thick with the tang of bird droppings and the effervescent bite of the tree's leaves and resin.  Worn wooden charms dangle from the branches above, clattering faintly against one another in the humid air."
