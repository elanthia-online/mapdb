      "Hiding in the shadows of the high curtain wall, the kennels are dark and silent, the yips and cries of dogs a conspicuous absence.  Part of the flagstone path diverts toward the building, an open-air collection of grated cages with a veranda anchored to the interior wall.  There is a long trough before it to water the dogs, but the leftover water has a skim of black and green moss across it."
