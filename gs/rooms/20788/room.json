      "This spacious foyer is enhanced by a large glass skylight which reflects colored lights about the room and among many of the plants.  Comfortable chairs near a pinewood bar invite you to relax before returning to your duties.  Against one wall, a small walnut counter sits beneath a blackboard, and a silver arch, a green arch, and a white arch lead out of the foyer."
