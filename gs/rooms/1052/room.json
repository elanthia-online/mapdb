      "A furrow begins just to the northwest, becoming deeper as it moves northwest until the bottom is completely shrouded in darkness.  The trail skirts the furrow on both sides, tracking northeast and northwest.  Very little grows in the furrow, although some of the grasses have attempted to root in the beginnings.  The few stones that peek out from the sides of the furrow have a peculiar glazed look to them, not dissimilar to the stones one might find at the bottom of a blacksmith's forge."
