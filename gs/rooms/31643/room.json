      "Lifeless glass eyes stare down from beam-bound wires set across the ceiling, the stuffed avians posed in mid-flight, their dusty wings draped in lacy webbing.  Anatomical sketchings of both man and beast are displayed in yellowed bone frames above the ichor-splattered fireplace, the drawings overshadowed by the fractured glass display case set upon the mantel.  Worn leather chairs are gathered around several rune-carved tables, their surfaces littered with scorch marks."
