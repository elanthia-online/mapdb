    "description": [
      "The surroundings are a veritable haze of green, as the young, thin branches sprout forth their bounty of beautiful leaves.  The intricate criss-crossing of the branches forms an intertwined webwork that makes itself evident further to the north -- there, a small dome arcs over the surroundings, providing respite and shelter from the elements.  A few curled branches within the dome provide comfortable seating, while others offer generous amounts of space to stretch out and stargaze."
