      "Surrounded by crowded shelves littered with ledger books, nautical charts, and a variety of bric-a-brac, the office has a cramped appearance.  An enormous desk, its surface largely bare, sits at the center of the space and is surrounded by several stools that create a companionable space as if the clerk were having a gathering instead of collecting debt.  One marble wall is devoid of shelves, its surface instead covered by an enormous map of Kraken's Fall."
