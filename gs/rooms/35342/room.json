      "Turquoise walls shimmer softly as arcs of electricity leap between suspended lightning rods, casting fleeting patterns of light across polished yellow pine floors.  Silver and gold celestial symbols frame the doorways, their intricate designs catching and scattering the flickering glow.  Near the back of the room, a dark wooden counter stands quietly, its surface marked with faint scorch lines."
