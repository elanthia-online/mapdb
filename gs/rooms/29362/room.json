      "Chain-strung lanterns hang unlit above the earthen-walled dwelling.  A lopsided wooden table stands across the cramped room from a filthy glass-covered counter.  Floating in through a small round window, the salty air mingles with the scents of recently prepared dishes.  Nailed into the hardened dirt walls, a wrinkled folded notecard appears closely guarded by a heavily armored kobold."
