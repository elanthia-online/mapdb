      "Soft felt walls rise in a neat ring around the chamber, their surface muted by hanging bundles from an oak-framed drying rack of herbs set along the outer curve.  A simple sleeping pallet rests on the wooden floor nearby, its thick cushion fitted with a tightly stitched wool cover.  A small pot-bellied stove stands close to the wall, its steady heat warming the enclosed space."
