      "Benches are scattered beneath trees for shade and protection from inclement weather.  Devoid of snow and grass, large rocks lined up on the ground mark out lanes that lead up to bald spots on the land enclosed with stones in a circular pattern.  A large 'X' painted in white is at the heart of the ring.  To the sides of the tracks are huge racks holding hammers with different-sized handles."
