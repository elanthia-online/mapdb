      "Soft, moss-hued, woolen carpets cover the floor of the expansive interior of the tent.  Dark green silk flows down from a polished mistwood frame, each of the poles carved with a flowering vine pattern.  A series of copper lanterns hangs from the rafters, blanketing the space with a warm glow."
