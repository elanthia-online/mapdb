      "A circular display dominates the center of the window-framed room, the inner walls of the table reinforced by riveted plates of drakar radiating constant heat across the sand-filled pit.  Smaller versions of the rounded containers are scattered across the expansive facility, each one uniquely erected with varieties of glass, metal, and clockwork contraptions slowly clicking at random intervals.  The chair-lined wall displays hand-sketched studies of several species alongside stacks of scrolls."
