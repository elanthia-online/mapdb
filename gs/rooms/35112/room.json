      "A carpet of woven sea grasses, dried and dyed a rich cobalt blue, stretches from the entrance of the shrine to a dais at the far end.  Atop the rise stands a single chair of seaglass, and just below it awaits an altar of the same translucent material.  A trident of pure gold hangs from the ceiling by a pair of chains, its tines studded with bright-colored jewels."
