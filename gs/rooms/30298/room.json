      "Winding around a group of palms, shrubbery pulls away and opens to a panoramic view of the neighboring oasis.  Huddling adjacent from some twining trees is a tethered palm-framed stall with a patchwork morduska hide canopy, the breeze causing the copper sign dangling from the building to swing.  Wind-rippled sand surrounds a faded blue domed canvas tent with a narrow entrance, creating soft mounds that press up against the obstruction, the desert attempting to reclaim its territory."
