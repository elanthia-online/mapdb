      "A veritable sea of candles is arranged upon the crystalline ledges that line the walls, casting the area in a bright, steady glow of scarlet-streaked amber.  A large desk edged in pale sapphire stands in the middle of the room, its surface polished to a mirror finish.  The far northern wall is completely transparent, the sprawling cityscape below spreading out for miles and miles."
