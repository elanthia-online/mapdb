      "Soft, ambient light emanates from intricately designed lanterns suspended from the ceiling, casting gentle shadows across the white stone floor.  Thick vines trail from hanging planters, their tendrils framing clusters of floral-patterned cushions arranged neatly across the pebbled ground.  A central wooden table holds small bowls of herbs, vials, and a mortar and pestle, its surface dusted with faint traces of crushed leaves.  A faint aroma of blossoms and herbal infusions lingers in the still air."
