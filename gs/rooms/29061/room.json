      "A repurposed captain's chair sits upon a raised platform near the back of the hut.  Smaller chairs, a few barstools, and some woven grass mats are placed on the ground before it.  A large firepit, blackened with use, is positioned beneath an opening in the conical, white canvas roof.  A large, feather-stuffed mattress encased in patched sailcloth rests against a decoratively adorned side wall."
