      "White marble walls speckled with tiny diamonds enclose a formidable sitting room.  Hanging from the ceiling, a large crystal chandelier bears an array of lit candles, giving off a glorious light reflected through the crystals.  Nestled against the far wall is a plump white sofa, offering comfortable seating to WATCH the ongoing show through the large window on the opposite wall."
