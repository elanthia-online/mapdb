      "Age has defaced but not managed to weaken a towering blue stone arch that looms over the walkway just before its slope intensifies markedly.  Creepers cling to what limited purchase cracks in the stone can provide, but the ancient architecture's foundation appears to be mingled with the roots of the island itself, so sturdy does it seem.  Its bulk provides more than adequate shelter from the rain."
