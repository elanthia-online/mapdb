      "Slipping between stacked stone entries, the twining path leaves the standing stones at either end to provide entry through the barrier walls of a court cairn.  Large and flat fieldstones covered in moss form sentinel pillars between long burial niches fitted into the walls that are made of a mingling of curbstones, quarry rocks, and chunks of blue shale.  Ancient and ravaged by wind, a series of wooden posts are topped with various pieces of tattered fabric that flutter in the breeze and cast moving shadows upon the walls."
