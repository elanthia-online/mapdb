    ],
    "description": [
      "The distinctive tang of spoor is heavy in the air on the game trail, a hidden path forged out of the surrounding woodland by predators and prey.  Pine, spruce, and tamarack crowd in on the narrow passage, boughs full of their prickling needles poking out into the walkway at uneven intervals.  A cluster of holly bushes, their frozen berries glinting in the aurora's light, frame a path leading to more open woodland in the southeast."
