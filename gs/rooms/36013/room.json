      "Distributaries from the lake wind just beyond conical gers, their narrow channels slipping through the grass at the backs of the western dwellings.  Across the worn walking path, the eastern side opens into a broad paddock where goats, sheep, and muskox wander in loose groups.  A fence fashioned of birch saplings marks the boundary, its pale uprights edging a small path that leads to the enclosure's interior."
