      "A jut of volcanic stones jabs into the frigid grey waters.  Seafoam clings to the black rocks, its susurrus a steady counterpoint to the crashing of the waves.  Though the air is crisp and clean, a faint scent of fishy brine lingers on the icy breeze and is especially thick around a small dark shack built along the shore."
