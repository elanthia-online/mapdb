      "The table occupying the nook is smaller and its tooling more intricate than the others in the tea room.  Covered by a shade of brass that has been pierced with floral patterns, a single candle lights the niche, the sweetness of its beeswax commingling with the omnipresent scent of dried tea leaves.  Blue rose petals are artfully scattered across the tabletop around the place settings."
