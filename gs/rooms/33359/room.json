      "The carved archway opens into a cozy room that is permeated with the fragrance of sandalwood and lavender.  A heavy dark oak bookcase stands on each side of a black marble fireplace, while several trinkets adorn the mantle above.  On the opposite wall sits a sturdy oak desk with a glass top covering its surface and a high-backed leather chair rising behind it."
