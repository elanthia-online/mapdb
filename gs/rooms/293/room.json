Before you sprawls a gaudily-painted structure, adorned with elaborate carvings depicting scenes of commerce and lit by polished brass lamps.  This is the Merchant's Guild, where the business people of town, from wealthy traders to lowly street peddlers, meet to discuss matters of mutual concern.",
