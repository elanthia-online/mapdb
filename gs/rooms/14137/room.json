      "The great ring of yews wind their way around to the north.  The landscapers have taken great care to stagger their growth, from tallest in the north near the tower, to smallest in the south by the gate.  It is almost as if they were telling a story of time and life, slowly growing and maturing as they lead the way to the temple."
