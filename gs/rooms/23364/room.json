      "The floor of this room is covered with a brilliant sunburst mosaic.  Tiles of gold, electrum, and copper fit together on the pale blue marble floor, mimicking the sun's rays streaming through a clear sky.  Candles that burn brightly from gold sconces on every wall bring the mosaic to life, the metallic tiles twinkling and reflecting in the jagged shards of mirror scattered across the ceiling.  Three walls are fitted with benches covered in canary silk, and a white silk tapestry covers the eastern wall."
