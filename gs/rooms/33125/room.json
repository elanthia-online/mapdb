      "From the corners of this spacious hexagonal room rise pale granite pillars cleverly carved to mimic wide-boled willow trees.  Like branches, granite tracery overhead supports a transparent glaes ceiling, pierced in the center by the flue of a circular fieldstone hearth.  To one side stands a simple wooden pedestal, the ranger statue it holds reflected in the still pool nearby.  A polished malachite token is set above the willow withe arch piercing the southern wall."
