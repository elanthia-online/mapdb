      "Though splitting to run both east and west, the path's forward movement terminates in an aged wooden platform that is built out over a mill pond in a crescent-shaped deck.  Benches line its railing, and where the supports keep hold of dry land, amber-glowing wisp lanterns grow in dense patches, lending to the warm, quiet ambiance of this place of rest."
