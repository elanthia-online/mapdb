      "A canopy of leaves blocking out most of the view of the sky and the ground below gives this treetop perch a feeling of privacy.  It is not exactly quiet here, but the sleepy trill of roosting birds and whisper of a breeze passing over verdant green foliage is pleasant and soothing.  The trunk of the oak descends to the ground below.",
