      "At regular intervals burning torches held in place by chains keep the shadows at bay.  On a peg flanked by a reinforced eahnor door and a reinforced faenor door, hangs a single key that can be used to unbolt each cell in this block.  Located in the middle of each door is a slot large enough to pass a tray of food or other similarly sized item through to the inmate."
