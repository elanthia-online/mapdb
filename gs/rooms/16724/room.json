      "[Wall of the Ravine]"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Sans the small ledge upon which you perch, the face of the ravine wall is completely smooth and offers little purchase to maneuver.  A thick rope leading upward vanishes over the tantalizingly close precipice of the ravine above, beyond which the top of a column is just visible.  Below, various birds float on rising thermals around a large rope leading downward, black and brown specs against the thread of river at the bottom of the ravine."
