      "Bent and slightly bruised, tall grass grows along the edges of the tent, though the main walking space has been trimmed down to a lush carpet of cushy green.  Several low tables and a river reed basket are scattered about the space and covered with a variety of wares.  Shimmering glass trinkets dangle from the rafters, their edges softly clicking against each other to provide a delicate tinkling within the bourde-swaddled environment."
