      "A chill in the air belies the chamber's depth beneath the chalet.  Surrounded by gently sloping granite walls, each carved with a relief giving the impression of stacked stone blocks, the wine cellar bears several vibrant cherrywood wine shelves set nearly floor to ceiling.  Soft golden light from a trio of pewter lanterns overhead illuminates a long rosewood counter resting against the far wall, where a locker rests on the polished surface beneath a carved golden linden mirror."
