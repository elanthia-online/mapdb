    "description": [
      "Modest by most comparisons, the manse is only two stories high.  Blackened mortar and brick make up much of the structure, timbered with crimson window lintels and wooden shutters.  Ornately carved rosewood doors at the entry feature silvery vaalin hinges and other fittings, and are flanked with oil lamps to illuminate the night.  A scrollworked wrought iron \"M\" is bolted near the top of the white brick chimney billowing forth smoke, and crimson trumpetflower vines scale the walls with their riotous blooms."
