      "As orange as a burning sunset, zinnias and dahlias overtake the unrestrained gardens, popping into oversized globes of vivid petals.  Radiant light condenses into the forms of ethereal butterflies, resplendent and multihued, that flutter over the elaborate, inflorescent orbs.  Luminous motes trail off the tips of their intangible, wispy wings as they flit from bloom to bloom."
