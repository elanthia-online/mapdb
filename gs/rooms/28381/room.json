      "Tapestries of rich verdant green dominate the walls of the room, creating an illusion of a forest as they drape to the floor.  A jumble of cushions in jade and emerald are piled high before a fieldstone fireplace.  Several faceted crystal discs hang in the window over a simple teakwood table, spreading patterns of moonlight across the walls as they spin lazily."
