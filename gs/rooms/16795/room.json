      "Again the bodies have been cut up to fit the holes.  Nothing of value has been left to the dead.  Some skulls show signs that the teeth have been chipped out and are now missing.  They must have been made of gold and taken for their value.  Bile forms in your mouth as you think about the evil that could have done this.  These poor tortured souls will never be able to rest in a crypt like this."
