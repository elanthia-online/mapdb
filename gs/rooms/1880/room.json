      "The narrow street lies dormant with gray sights, scents and sounds of a place ever untouched by light.  Nothing speaks.  Nothing moves.  Nothing seems to recognize your existence except for small puffs of dust which settle at your feet.  A sense of unease builds in your gut, prodding you to move onward."
