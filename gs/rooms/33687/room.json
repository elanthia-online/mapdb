      "Faint light flickers across the area from a single torch housed in the curving arch of the niche, though most of the room remains deeply entrenched in shadows.  Long strands of cobwebs attached to the ceiling stretch across a white stork-adorned banner, which is hung near a glass and brass display case.  Stagnant and cloying, the air tastes of dust and smells of decay."
