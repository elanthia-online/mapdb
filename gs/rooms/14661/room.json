      "The air is thick with the scent of sap, and the ichor that drips constantly down the walls is thicker than before.  The thin tendrils of living root surrounding the tunnel squirm and writhe around you, as if disturbed by your presence.  The wooden tentacles grip you more firmly now, each holding you tightly as the next slithers down quickly to take you into its proverbial arms."
