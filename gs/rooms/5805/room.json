      "Fallen beams narrow the mine shaft to no more than a yard's width at points.  A fine sifting of dust covers every available surface, including your skin and hair.  Holes along the walls near their bases look uncomfortably like burrows, their entrances a deeper blackness in the eternal twilight."
