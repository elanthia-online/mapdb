      "Haon-slatted umbrellas of shot silk shade the wicker chairs and tables surrounding a taerethil-draped cream limestone shop, the sugared scents of freshly baked bread and pastries wafting through the arched entry.  Pastel-colored boxes are stacked against the rectangular glass window, the vellum graced by seals of metallic wax, then adorned in silken bows curled at the edges.  A diminutive flock of black-billed magpies flit to and from the iron-railed balcony above, disappearing into their twig-crafted nests."
