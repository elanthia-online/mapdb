      "The dwellers within the shacks built in this tiny clearing are drenched in eternal gloom as the thick trees completely blot out any sight of the sky above.  The slowly rippling water of the swamp is serene and placid however, and although this alcove is quite dreary, it does provide quiet and solitude for those who prefer privacy."
