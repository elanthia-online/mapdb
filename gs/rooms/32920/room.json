      "Rounded instead of squared, the end of the dock has five slips that allow ships to dock in a circle around its refurbished decking.  A crisp, freshly painted number five in navy blue dominates the central planks, which show recent signs of scrubbing.  Bronze and brass-hitching cleats stand at the ready to serve those that seek portage."
