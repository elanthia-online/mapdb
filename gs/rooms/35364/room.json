      "Whitewashed walls serve as the shop's backdrop, adorned with delicate sketches of island wildflowers.  Sporadic splashes of color highlight select blooms, adding strategic accents.  Wide, open windows invite natural light and sea breezes, while frosted teardrop globes suspended from the ceiling cast a soft glow.  A long counter spans the center of the room, dividing the space, while racks and hooks display garments.  In one corner, a freckled half-elven seamstress works quietly, her needle moving with steady precision."
