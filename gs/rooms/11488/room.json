      "The grasses grow high on either side of the pathway.  The path itself is little more than a slightly lower growth of scrub grass and weeds.  The crunching of oyster shells underfoot is the only reminder that this was once a real walkway.  A brown vine has creeped partway up the high stucco wall."
