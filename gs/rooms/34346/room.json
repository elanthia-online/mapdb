      "Winds howl relentlessly, and bitterly cold rain batters against a massive stone hall with ferocious intensity but rolls off the sides of the domed roof.  Rivulets of water trickle down its walls, scattering the tiny glints of light reflected in flecks of mica trapped in the large, schist flakes.  Built out from the crater wall, it creates the illusion that the hall has always been a part of the landscape and is as natural as the mountain itself."
