      "Smooth and inviting, the boards of the stage floor stretch evenly from upstage to down.  Overhead, booms and battens rub elbows with the light bridge - the narrow platform behind the teaser curtain, from which lighting instruments are hung.  Framed in velvet curtains, the opening across the proscenium and into the auditorium fairly calls with expectancy."
