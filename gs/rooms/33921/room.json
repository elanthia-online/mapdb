      "A vaulted white marble ceiling rises above a pair of statues standing beside each other on a raised platform at the center of this square chamber.  The marble-finished walls that enclose this serene space are lined with rune-incised plaques that indicate the permanent residents of the crypts behind them.  Long ironwood boxes full of glowing toadstool clusters line the perimeter of the room, giving everything a bluish glow.  A wide hallway leads east, while dark corridors lead off in the other cardinal directions."
