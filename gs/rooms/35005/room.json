      "A nest full of speckled eggs occupies a dropping-stained niche in the rock face just beneath the edge of the cliff, tantalizingly close but impossibly distant at the same time.  The cliff's edge looks out over a deadly drop of hundreds of feet onto the black sands below.  Red grasses peek up through the banks of snow, lending splashes of vibrant color to the monochrome of the highland landscape."
