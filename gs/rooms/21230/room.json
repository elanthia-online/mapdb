      "A fringed crimson silk banner hangs on one of the refurbished driftwood walls, and a domed white stucco ceiling rises overhead.  A woven Vornavian silk rug sits in one corner of a varnished dark oak floor.  There is a plain wooden table on one side of the shop and a slender driftwood counter on the other."
