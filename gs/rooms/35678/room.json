      "The path ends at the base of a colossal disc of peculiar blue stone that looms overhead as a great black shadow.  Within its darkness, the air is cruelly cold and smells faintly of burning ozone.  The monument's stony construction is pocked from years beneath the wave where it is not crowded by an overgrowth of coral in a chaotic rainbow of colors.  Along unsullied surfaces, there are hints of ancient carvings that bleed a pale glow that brings to mind a sky tossed by storms."
