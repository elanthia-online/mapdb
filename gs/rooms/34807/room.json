      "Flames roar and pine wood gives a merry crackle from within a stone-framed hearth yawning out of the northern wall.  Comfortable couches of supple stouthorn rolton leather are positioned to take fullest advantage of the proffered heat.  A marqueted credenza positioned between two pairs of mullioned windows overlooking the yard profers holds bottles of spirits offer warmth of a different variety.  Smells of roasting meat and baking tarts waft gently from a trefoil arch in the eastern wall."
