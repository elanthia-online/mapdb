      "As a river smoothes the rocks of its bed, the haut-relief sandstone carvings of temple dancers that line the hall have been worn to a shine in spots by the passage of countless worshippers.  The dancers' contorted limbs are braceleted here and there with vines that have taken advantage of cracks in the masonry."
