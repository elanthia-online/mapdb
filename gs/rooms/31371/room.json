      "Warm, moisture-laden air fills this large conservatory.  Countless panes of copper-hued glass framed with white metal arch high overhead, warding off the alpine night.  Night birds silently flit to and fro after prey.  Marble tile pathways lead between raised planter beds, each filled with lush flora and dotted with blooms in gradient hues.  A densely canopied dwarf haon is the focal point, its translucent leaves casting a luminescent halo magnified by a reflection pool beneath its elliptical foliage."
