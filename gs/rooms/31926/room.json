      "Candles lit with flickering light overwhelm the majority of the floor space and sit in sconces and niches set along the wall, often with nary a scrap of space between each taper.  The flames regularly splutter out, victims of an ever-present chilly draft, but quickly spring back to life, as if the mausoleum's four stately coffins are unable to bear lingering for too long in darkness.  Barely visible in the warm illumination, hints of a violet glow suffuse thin fissures along the walls."
