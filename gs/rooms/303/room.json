      "Many of the travellers through this part of town appear to be pilgrims, priests and monks.  They travel to and fro, moving along the quiet road to the north.  The hoot of an owl echoes from somewhere beyond the palisade wall.",
      "The ongoing parade of citizenry that passes by seems to take on a special character in this part of town.  Mixed in with the usual denizens, you notice a preponderance of travellers who appear to be pilgrims, priests and monks.  They file in and out of the road to the north."
