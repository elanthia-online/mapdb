      "Jutting up like a knife, a rift in the rock floor rises two feet, forming a large step.  The canyon widens here allowing large portions of the silvery night sky to be seen.  Resting along the northeast wall of the canyon, piles of rubble show signs of recent additions.  Echoing sounds can be heard from all directions while a chattering noise can be heard from the south, coming from wide cracks in the rock outcrop.",
