      "The stench of brimstone and sting of ozone hang heavy in the air of the laboratory.  A boiling alembic giving off noxious fumes sits over a brazier on a stained, deal-topped lab table.  Around the equipment are unstoppered vials of brightly colored substances.  It appears the alchemist was called away in mid-experiment."
