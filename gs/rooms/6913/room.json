      "Cobwebs stream from the ancient shorings like party streamers, perfectly still in the stagnant air.  Spiders large and small crawl over them, building them up and repairing them where passers-by have damaged the threads.  One spider has a large silken bundle on one corner of his web, likely an insectile victim for his evening meal."
