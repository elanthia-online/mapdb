      "A slight breeze gusts through the thick oak branches, sending them into motion.  Their leaves chatter wildly, almost seeming to communicate as sentient beings.  Slowly, the flurry of commotion dies out, returning the trees to their silent, brooding state.  Partially obscured by a thick clump of moss, a pair of yellowed cobblestones testify to the shattered remains of a path through the woods.",
