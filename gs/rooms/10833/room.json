      "Thick rushes rise from the dank water, choking the area and providing excellent cover for anything small enough to fit underneath them.  The rushes, combined with the water cover and unsure footing, keep the larger predators out of the area.  Muskrat dens appear frequently along the edges of what might still be called a 'road,' and often one of the small, bare-tailed mammals can be seen scurrying for the safety of its home."
