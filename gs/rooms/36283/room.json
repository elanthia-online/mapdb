      "Cramped yet tidy, the studio has a solid mahogany floor and slate walls.  Honeycomb cubbies are built between the floor and underside of an ascending spiral staircase, the octagonal compartments filled with all manner of supplies, half-finished projects, cups, bowls, and other bric-a-brac associated with the art of creation.  A long paint-marred table provides ample room for new creations and has a tall metal-fortified stool set before it."
