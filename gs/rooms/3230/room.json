      "Rowdy shouts from customers in taverns and the gaming hall cut through the din of foot traffic along the road, making the burrows and above-ground shops to the north seem almost too quiet by comparison.  Stately street lights of wrought iron proceed to either side of the cobblestone road.  Those to the south have bases fashioned into the shapes of halflings holding tankards and ale mugs aloft, while their northern counterparts are robed or cowled, bearing wands and staves.",
      "On the north side of the cobblestone road everything seems quiet, almost too quiet.  To the south, you can hear the rowdy shouts of people in the taverns and the gaming hall."
