      "A break in the line of willow trees affords a clear view of the river.  The water moves slowly across the flat land, carrying a variety of leaves and twigs on its glossy surface.  Several brown trout lie motionless against the rocky bottom, their forms gently outlined by the bright, silvery moonlight.",
