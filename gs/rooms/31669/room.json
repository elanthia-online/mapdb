      "The path alongside the ultramarine stream is lit by spectral violet dreamphlox blossoms tucked within sprays of velvet-soft azure grasses and tiny motes of shimmering light that dance beneath the trees.  With bark the hue of huckleberries and foliage of magenta and pale lavender, the trees hide within their canopies creatures that can be heard chittering, chirping, and whistling in unfamiliar tones.  At the edge of the stream, an oversized azure calla lily dips and bows its head toward the water with any breeze."
