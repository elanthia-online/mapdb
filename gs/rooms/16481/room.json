      "Captured banners and the heads of the men they once belonged to ring the walls of the warchief's hut.  A throne is situated in the center of the room in the forefront of a rack displaying trophies of war, some rotting, some not.  The remains of meals and broken tankards litter the ground, staining luxuriant captured rugs strewn across the floor of the hut.  Several grotesque piles of body parts are scattered across the tent."
