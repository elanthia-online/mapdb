      "Richly paneled walls and lush crimson carpeting are illuminated by myriad candles behind hunter green glass, but the focal point of this pit is the elaborate roulette wheel on a polished mahogany table.  The numbers chart, betting sign, and rules poster are all framed in gold and hang from the rosewood walls in easy view of all gamblers."
