      "Centered on a stretch of land, in the middle of a network of several small ponds, is the beckoning shelter of a growth of willow trees.  Their long, graceful branches sway gently back and forth on a barely palpable wind.  A soft rustling sound emits from the characteristic leaves covering the branches of the willow trees that droop and almost reach to the ground.  Under the wavering light of the moon, the willow trees resemble ghosts dragging their distended arms along the surface of the ground.",

As the wind parts the branches of the trees, the sunlight seems to dance across the surface of the pond water beyond it."
