      "The mountain plunges to the north, stabbing downward past a rocky outcropping until it reaches the timberline below.  Beyond the timberline, the slope levels to join a wide valley, its broad expanse disappearing into the distance.  Trees and snow cover the undulating hills of the valley.  Southwards, the pass ascends a short ridge framed by rugged peaks to the east and west."
