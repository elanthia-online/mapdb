      "Deep cherrywood paneling lines the walls of this space, and a thick bearskin rug covers almost the entirety of the floor.  The combination serves to give the room a dark, comfortable ambience when joined to the sweet lingering scent of pipe tobacco ingrained into every surface.  Light pours from a large wrought iron chandelier overhead, sending interesting shadows flickering into the darker corners.  A large sturdy chest sits next to the front door with an oversized hook in the wall above it."
