      "Several pillows of brightly hued silk are heaped in the corners of this rear nook of the tent, with small tables set beside them bearing peaked copper incense burners and bowls of various gemstone beads, carved bone adorments, and flat skeins of metallic wiring.  Sitting side-by-side in the center of the area is a thin-limbed bronze jewelry tree and a wood-framed glass jewelry case."
