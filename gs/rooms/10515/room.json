      "[The Toadwort, Grasping Mire]"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Moist, soft grass blankets most of the ground in this portion of the swamp, and seemingly dry sand devoid of any visible signs of life covers the rest.  Odd, pale-purple flowers with a touch of yellow in one spot boldly poke their heads high above the grass.  The petals of the flowers are twisted in such a way that they strongly resemble the face of a monkey.  Unseen, but clearly heard, yellow throats call out to one another, and a small nest is located at the base of a stunted, unidentified bush."
