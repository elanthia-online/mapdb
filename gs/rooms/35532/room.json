      "A ship-carved driftwood cabinet dominates the back wall of the kelp-draped cavern, the tall carved wood masts draped in a series of lantern-bound nets that illuminate the shadowy corners of the shop.  Between decorative treasure chests filled with sea glass and silver are a set of brass-cornered shelves, the garment-filled vessels flanked by spheres of colorful coral and naevela-folded fish."
