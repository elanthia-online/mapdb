      "Climbing roses nearly cover the trellis they twine about, and deep green ivy thickly covers the outside of the temple and surrounding stone wall in this area.  Exotic ferns are mixed in with beautiful deep hued flowers of many varieties.  Here and there, the dark colors of the flowers are broken up with splashes of snowy white iris and snapdragons.  Brightly colored butterflies flit about, adding their charm to the scene.",
