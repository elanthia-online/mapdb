      "The branches of nearby trees on the shoreline extend over the lagoon, breaking apart pallid shafts of moonlight with their leaf-laden forms.  Though the humidity of the jungle is still prominent, the coolness of the lagoon at night provides respite as the water laps back and forth gently.  The calls of nocturnal birds and the distant twinkle of fireflies flitting in and out of the jungle nearby join the moonlight glistening from the black surface of the water, creating a beautiful nighttime escape.",
      "The branches of nearby trees on the shoreline extend over the lagoon, shading the water and breaking apart shafts of sunlight with their leaf-laden forms.  Though the humidity is still prominent, the coolness of the lagoon provides a small respite from the intense heat as the water laps gently back and forth.  Sunlight glistens from the crystalline surface of the liquid, lending it a sparkling appearance that extends in a vivid field of silky blue water towards the rushing waterfall in the north."
