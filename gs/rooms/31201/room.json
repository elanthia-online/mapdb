      "Large tapestries stretch from wall to wall on each side of the tent.  One displays sweeping dunes in a variety of golden shades against a horizon of aquamarine.  Colorful caravans file one after the other, bright beneath the saffron sun above.  The other tapestry depicts a sweeping landscape that transforms from lush, verdant rainforests at one end to ashen wastelands on the other.  In the space between the tapestries, a circular mirror-topped table sits in the center on a circular rug, and on the table is a small electrum-framed case."
