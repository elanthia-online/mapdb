      "After a final steep scramble, the trail widens out to a path that slopes to an end at a sheer drop off.  About twenty feet below, the snowy valley floor is cut in half by the black stripe of a cold, rushing stream.  Heavy pegs, pounded into the old ice, look like they have been there for generations.  From the pegs, a knotted rope disappears over the side of the cliff."
