      "Sunlight filters through narrow, gold-trimmed windows, warming the white marble walls.  Gold-accented counters are carved with river motifs, depicting swirling currents and leaping fish.  A brass rod supports a canopy of light blue silk, embroidered with Torre's white stork crest.  The far wall features a mural of Torre's docks, where storks swoop over anchored ships.  Pendant lanterns, with copper stork bodies and etched glass panels, hang overhead, casting a soft, steady light."
