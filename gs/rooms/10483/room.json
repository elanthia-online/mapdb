      "Ragged shelving still clings to a partial wall in this open chamber, the individual planks leaning at odd angles.  Shards of pottery and other minor debris lie across the dusty floor, little reminders of a time when this now-ruined house was first ransacked and looted.  The faint scent of spices and cooking oils lingers in the chill night air.",
