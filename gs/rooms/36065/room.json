      "The carpenter's ability to blend nature and domicile within the confines of this room is awe-inspiring.  The walls are meticulously carved to resemble willow bark.  A luxurious green carpet mimics grass underfoot.  Beneath a beam carved in the likeness of a branch, an enormous feather-stuffed bed dominates its corner.  In the opposite sits a desk, tidy and neat, betraying the infrequency of its use."
