      "Teeming with greenery and flowers, the center of the court provides a temporary gathering spot for the residents of the city.  Beds of multicolored peonies, deep green ivy, and the wey's namesake amaranth line the cobblestone square beneath a canopy of thick shade trees.  Sunlight drifts across the cobbles in small patches, moving at the whimsy of the breeze as it stirs the leafy boughs above.",

Beds of multicolored peonies, thickly carpeted ivy, and the wey's namesake amaranth line the cobblestone square beneath a canopy of thick shade trees.  Moonlight filters through the leafy boughs above, illuminating the area in a cool silvery sheen."
