      "Exposed rafters dominate the rough oak-plank ceiling, their broad expanses fitted with large, blackened iron hooks that keep amber-glassed lanterns aloft.  Dirty windows offer views of the street beyond, their smudged panes allow the aurora-kissed sky to paint wares displayed on nearby counters in violet hues.  Wicker baskets line the eastern wall, while the western one is fitted with a large, open ironwood door surrounded by heavy iron chains."
