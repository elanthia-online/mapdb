    "description": [
      "A moss-covered sunken fishing dock barely serves as a way to traverse along this side of the pond, its warped surface tipping and tilting with each shift or step.  Violet-flecked viridian moss hangs from countless dead, petrified trees, their dull grey boughs entangled to the point where it isn't clear where one begins or ends.  Dark ichor oozes down long, tangled vines hanging from the surrounding banyans like rivulets of sap, thick and gooey as it pools near the water's edge."
