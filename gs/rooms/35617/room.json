      "Inside the spacious cabin, a sprawling bunk of teak with widowwood insets is bolted to the planks of the deck.  Moldering blankets, once blue and yellow but reduced to mockeries of those hues by encroaching spots of black mildew, have been cast aside and trail through the shallow water of the flooded compartment.  A battered foot locker sits at the base of the bed, its wooden frame swollen shut with the damp.  An intact lantern of smoky glass sits atop a writing desk of once-fine Turamzzyrian oak."
