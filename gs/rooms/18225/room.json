      "The beautiful array of flowers planted in this garden holds nearly every color of the rainbow.  Obviously cultivated by a skilled hand, each flower blooms in colorful brilliance.  Lantern light filters in from the street, throwing shadows of several dogwood trees across the rough flagstone path, which winds its way through the lush garden grass towards a quaint white-washed cottage with blue trim.  A carved wooden bench rests under the nearest tree."
