      "This room is rather cozy, but well-organized despite the lack of floor space.  A sturdy desk sits in the middle of the room, its surface covered with trinkets and baubles, and a large cabinet stands against one wall.  Interspersed around the walls are various paintings, each one rather abstract and seeming to be more focused on colors than shapes.  A small window provides enough light to see by, and a small fireplace is nestled against one wall in case more light or heat is required."
