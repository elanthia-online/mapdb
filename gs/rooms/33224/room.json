      "Several bioluminescent fungi dotting the walls and ceiling provide light for the subterranean cavern, casting a soothing blue-green glow over everything.  Set into the moist rock wall, a ladder leads to a wooden panel in the ceiling.  A single strand of tiny glass baubles hangs over a partially buried sea chest, each glowing with a yellow-red light, and steam rises from a handcarved stone pool in the center of the cavern.  Some shelves hold several towels and a handful of refreshments."
